# Carrington Blueprint

This is a WordPress theme boilerplate intended to be your starting point for creating a responsive theme using Carrington Core.

Carrington Blueprint uses several technologies to help you create new themes quickly. It leverages [Crowd Favorite](http://crowdfavorite.com)'s Sassified and responsive 12-column [CSSGrid](https://github.com/crowdfavorite/css-grid) and the powerful [Carrington Core](https://github.com/crowdfavorite/wp-carrington-core) template engine. You can find relevant documentation for Carrington Core in a README located in each directory.

### Installation

Simply navigate to the `wp-content/themes` directory and clone this project into that directory. Remember to update the submodules before activating the theme.

---

### Editing

This theme uses [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) and [Compass](http://compass-style.org) for CSS pre-processing. Once both are installed, run `compass watch` from the `assets` directory to compile any changes you make to the Sass files.
