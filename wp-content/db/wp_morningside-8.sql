When David changed gears and started <a href="http://clickwp.com/">ClickWP</a>, a WordPress support business, he stopped going by the Buzzmedia name. In the U.S., a company also called Buzzmedia wished it had that Twitter username, and asked if they could have it since David wasn&#8217;t going to use it anymore.</p>\n<p>David, feeling the WordPress community love, said he would give them the name, and suggested they do something in return for the WordPress Foundation. So, everyone talked to everyone else and it worked out that Buzzmedia was willing to donate a fantastic venue for this year&#8217;s party as well as covering the bar.</p>\n<p>In the end, the Foundation got a great SXSW party, Buzzmedia got their twitter username, and David got the warm glow of having used his power for the good of the WordPress community, and they all lived happily ever after.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Seriously, though, the PureVolume House is always a great SXSW venue, so thank you David and Buzzmedia for your generosity! We&#8217;ll have drinks and snacks and a few hundred WordPress-loving partygoers, so you know it will be a good time. Kind of like a WordCamp afterparty without all the work of a WordCamp. <img src=''http://wordpress.org/news/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif'' alt='':)'' class=''wp-smiley'' /> </p>\n<p>The venue can hold 500 people, and based on last year, we&#8217;ll hit that pretty quickly. The one requirement is that you use WordPress. On the RSVP form, you will be asked to enter the URL of your WordPress-powered site (if you have more than one, just pick your main site). If you fill in this field with something other than what&#8217;s requested (such as &#8220;N/A&#8221; or putting in a fake url) your RSVP may be deleted, so please make sure to enter your real site.<br />\n<a href="http://wordpress.org/news/sxsw2012/"> RSVP Now</a>!</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:65:"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/03/wordpress-takes-sxsw-2012/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:41:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n			\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:18:"Year of the Meetup";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:53:"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/01/year-of-the-meetup/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:62:"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/01/year-of-the-meetup/#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 27 Jan 2012 20:17:49 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"Community";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=2210";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:456:"We hereby declare 2012 as the Year of the WordPress Meetup.

Basically, it&#8217;s people in a community getting together &#8212; meeting up &#8212; who share an interest in WordPress, whether they be bloggers, business users, developers, consultants, or any other category of person able to say, &#8220;I use WordPress in some way and I like it, and I want to meet other people who can say the same.&#8221; Meetups come in different shapes and sizes, but they all carry the benefit of connecting you with potential collaborators and friends, and helping you learn more about what you can do with WordPress. Here are some of the common types of WordPress meetups:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hang out and work on your WordPress sites together</li>\n<li>Social/happy hour type gatherings</li>\n<li>Mini-lectures/presentations</li>\n<li>Developer hacking meetups</li>\n<li>Show &amp; tell of how group members are using WordPress</li>\n<li>Formal instruction on how to use WordPress</li>\n<li>Lecture series (possibly with visiting speakers)</li>\n<li>Genius bar/help desk</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There&#8217;s no prescribed format, as each local group can decide for itself what they want to do. Some groups mix it up from month to month, while others have multiple events each month to satisfy the needs of their community.</p>\n<p>The tough part? Running a popular group takes time and money. Just as we worked last year to remove the financial burden for <a href="http://wordcamp.org">WordCamp</a> organizers and provide logistical support so they could focus more on their event content and experience, we want to start extending that kind of support to meetup groups as well. We don&#8217;t want it to cost anything for someone to run a WordPress meetup, or to attend one &#8212; building local communities should be as free as WordPress itself!</p>\n<p>Since there are so many more meetups than there are WordCamps, we&#8217;re going to start with the cost that is the same for every group: meetup.com organizer dues. We&#8217;re setting up an official WordPress account on <a href="http://Meetup.com">Meetup.com</a> right now, and over the next couple of weeks will be working with existing meetup group organizers, people who want to start a new meetup group, and the helpful folks at Meetup.com to put this program in place. WordPress meetup groups that choose to have their group become part of the WordPress account will no longer pay organizer dues for that group, as the <a href="http://wordpressfoundation.org">WordPress Foundation</a> will be footing the bill.</p>\n<p>This is exciting for several reasons. First, it means local organizers who are giving something back to the project by way of their time won&#8217;t also have shell out $12-19/month for the privilege. That alone is a big step. Second, it will open the door to more events and leaders within a community, since leadership and event planning won&#8217;t need to be tied to &#8220;owning&#8221; the meetup group. Third, more active meetup groups means more WordCamps, yay!</p>\n<p>In addition to the financial aspects, we&#8217;ll be working on ways to improve social recognition of meetup activity by incorporating feeds from the official meetup groups into the WordPress.org site, and including meetup group participation in the activity stream on your <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/">WordPress.org profile</a>.<sup>2</sup> I&#8217;m also hoping we can do something around providing video equipment to meetup groups (like we already do for WordCamps) to record presentations and tutorials that can be posted to <a href="http://WordPress.tv">WordPress.tv</a>, helping meetup groups offer WordPress classes in their community, and getting involved with mentoring WordPress clubs at local schools and universities. Oh, and we&#8217;ll send out some WordPress buttons and stickers to the groups that join in, because everyone loves buttons and stickers.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re also putting together some cool resources for people who want to start a new meetup group. There will be a field guide to getting started and some supplies to help you get your group going, and a forum for organizers to talk to and learn from each other.</p>\n<p>Over time, we&#8217;ll be talking to organizers and looking at what other expenses we can absorb and what other support we can provide to local groups. For now, we&#8217;re starting with the organizer dues. If you currently run a WordPress meetup group (whether you are using Meetup.com or not) or would like to start a WordPress meetup group in your area, please fill out our <a href="http://wordpressdotorg.polldaddy.com/s/wordpress-meetup-groups">WordPress Meetup Groups survey</a>. Filling in the survey doesn&#8217;t obligate you to join the official group, it just gives us a starting point to a) find out what groups are around/interested, and b) get some information on existing groups and their expenses and needs. Meetup.com will contact the group organizers who&#8217;ve said they&#8217;d like to join the new program, and will walk them through the logistics of the change and answer questions before helping them to opt-in officially.</p>\n<p>So, if you currently run a WordPress meetup group, or you would like to start one, please  fill out our <a href="http://wordpressdotorg.polldaddy.com/s/wordpress-meetup-groups">WordPress Meetup Groups survey</a>.

How would you feel if the web stopped being so free and independent? I&#8217;m <del>concerned</del> freaked right the heck out about the bills that threaten to do this, and as a participant in one of the biggest changes in modern history, you should be, too.</p>\n<p>You may have heard people talking/blogging/twittering about SOPA &#8212; the Stop Online Piracy Act. The recent <a href="http://godaddyboycott.org/">SOPA-related boycott of GoDaddy</a> was all over the news, with many people expressing their outrage over the possibilities of SOPA, but when I ask people about SOPA and its sister bill in the Senate, PIPA (Protect IP Act), many don&#8217;t really know what the bills propose, or what we stand to lose. If you are not freaked out by SOPA/PIPA, please: for the next four minutes, instead of checking Facebook statuses, seeing who mentioned you on Twitter, or watching the latest episode of Sherlock*, watch this video (by <a href="http://fightforthefuture.org/">Fight for the Future</a>).</p>\n<p>    <iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/31100268" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Some thoughts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the U.S. our legal system maintains that the burden of proof is on the accuser, and that people are innocent until proven guilty. This tenet seems to be on the chopping block when it comes to the web if these bills pass, as companies could shut down sites based on accusation alone.</li>\n<li>Laws are not like lines of PHP; they are not easily reverted if someone wakes up and realizes there is a better way to do things. We should not be so quick to codify something this far-reaching.</li>\n<li>The people writing these laws are not the people writing the independent web, and they are not out to protect it. We have to stand up for it ourselves.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Blogging is a form of activism. You can be an agent of change. Some people will tell you that taking action is useless, that online petitions, phone calls to representatives, and other actions won&#8217;t change a single mind, especially one that&#8217;s been convinced of something by lobbyist dollars. To those people, I repeat the words of Margaret Mead:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We are not a small group. More than 60 million people use WordPress &#8212; it&#8217;s said to power <a href="http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management/all">about 15% of the web</a>. We can make an impact, and you can be an agent of change.

Check out this short video that summarizes the things we think you&#8217;ll find are the cat&#8217;s pajamas:</p>\n<div id="v-I7NAw9Zk-1" class="video-player"><embed id="v-I7NAw9Zk-1-video" src="http://s0.videopress.com/player.swf?v=1.03&amp;guid=I7NAw9Zk&amp;isDynamicSeeking=true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="692" height="388" title="Introducing WordPress 3.3 &quot;Sonny&quot;" wmode="direct" seamlesstabbing="true" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" overstretch="true"></embed></div>\n<h3>For Users</h3>\n<p>Experienced users will appreciate the new <strong>drag-and-drop uploader</strong>, hover menus for the navigation, the new toolbar, improved co-editing support, and the new Tumblr importer. We&#8217;ve also been thinking a ton about what the WordPress experience is like for people completely new to the software. Version 3.3 has significant improvements there with<strong> pointer tips</strong> for new features included in each update, a friendly welcome message for first-time users, and revamped help tabs throughout the interface. Finally we&#8217;ve improved the dashboard experience on the iPad and other tablets with better touch support.</p>\n<h3>For Developers</h3>\n<p>There is a ton of candy for developers as well. I&#8217;d recommend starting your exploration with the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_editor">new editor API</a>, new jQuery version, better ways to hook into the help screens, more performant post-slug-only permalinks, and of course the entire list of improvements <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.3">on the Codex</a> and <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/milestone/3.3">in Trac</a>.</p>\n<h3>Roll the Credits</h3>\n<p>The Credits tab on the new About WordPress screen in the WordPress dashboard provides recognition for contributors to each release, but we like to thank them here as well.</p>\n<p><a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/users/aaroncampbell">Aaron D.

I wish I knew. My best guess as of this morning is that a <em>demigod</em> could design such a system, but it&#8217;s very difficult for mortal humans to do so, because once you know how to program it&#8217;s hard to avoid overdesigning, putting in things that will eventually be useful in year two but are discouraging in year zero. We make terrible pedagogical mistakes, like turning everything into an object.

I&#8217;m quoted in the article saying that the 49% marketshare we have among top blogs will continue to grow, and I&#8217;d like to expand on that a bit because it&#8217;s a strong statement.</p>\n<p>Typepad and Blogsmith, the two platforms that dropped the most over the past 3 years, are going to disappear either through blogs still using them losing relevance, or their active blogs switching away. Movable Type will likely follow suit, unless its now Japanese-led development makes a pretty drastic change in its product direction. (Consultants focused on Movable Type and Typepad have already started shifting focus to switching their clients to modern platforms to avoid losing the relationship.)</p>\n<p>The other big shift will come from the ~22% on custom platforms &#8212; this is going to become as niche as writing your own web server instead of using Apache or Nginx. Some organizations like Huffington Post might continue to make the necessary investments of over 40 engineers to maintain a platform at scale, the rest will find better return investing those resources in editorial. Great stories find an audience regardless of their platform.</p>\n<p>WordPress&#8217; biggest challenge over the next two years, and where we&#8217;re focusing core development, will be around evolving our dashboard to be faster and more accessible, especially on touch devices. Many of our founding assumptions about how, where, and why people publish are shifting, but the flexibility of WordPress as a platform and the tens of thousands of plugins and themes available are hard to match.

After conducting a thorough security review with Code Garage.com, an online security scanning website similar to Securi, they discovered that the point of entry was with the zero-day Timthumb vulnerability discovered back in August of 2011. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Last August, a zero-day vulnerability affected TimThumb that allowed hackers to execute their PHP code on any site that was running it. As it turns out, the WordPress theme we bought for the site employs pieces of TimThumb code &#8212; including the flaws that were exploited. </p>\n<p>Now we have to wait for the spammy search results to evaporate from Google’s cache before everything returns to normal.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Be sure to read the tips that Dan and his security adviser provides on protecting your site. Despite the vulnerability being patched soon after its discovery, sites are still becoming compromised. Because of the long tail effect and so many websites using WordPress these days, who knows when this point of entry will stop being taken advantage of. </p>\n<p>No related posts.</p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/cqu36nohqNM" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 09 Apr 2012 13:00:29 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:74:"Weblog Tools Collection: Contributing to WordPress Webinar with Jane Wells";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/?p=11254";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~3/PJrxV4299sg/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1062:"<p><a href="http://makewaves2012.com/">Make Waves</a> is on its way to enlist 500 people to give back to <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> in 2012, and if you&#8217;re curious about how you can be a part of that, don&#8217;t miss <a href="http://makewaves2012.com/how-anyone-can-give-back-to-wordpress/">How to Give Back to WordPress</a> from <a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>&#8216;s own <a href="http://jane.wordpress.com/">Jane Wells</a> on Tuesday, April 10 from 2 to 3 PM CDT.</p>\n<p>The webinar will cover ways for any WordPress user to help make WordPress the greatest blogging platform of all time.

You should know the routine by now. Don&#8217;t run beta software in a production environment. Instead, set up a local install or a mirrored copy somewhere else for testing. If you encounter a situation that you think is a bug, you can use the methods described within this <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Reporting_Bugs">Codex article</a> to report it.</p>\n<p>If you decide to give WordPress 3.4 Beta 1 a whirl, here are a couple of things to take a closer look at.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Theme Customizer with Previewer</li>\n<li>Flexible Custom Header Sizes</li>\n<li>Selecting Custom Header and Background Images from Media Library</li>\n<li>Better experience searching for and choosing a theme</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you noticed that these all appear to be improvements around themes, <a href="http://wpdevel.wordpress.com/2012/01/05/dev-chat-notes-01042012/">there is a reason for that</a>. Back in early January when the scope for WordPress 3.4 was being discussed, the overall theme (pardon the pun) for this release centered around the sites appearance. </p>\n<blockquote><p>The idea is that a combination of front-end features, dashboard features, and under-the-hood improvements all tied to managing your site’s appearance will be the focus of 3.4. It will also include smaller things that don’t live in the appearance section but are related to the overarching goal, such as making it possible to have links in image captions.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Speaking of links within image captions, this functionality should be in 3.4 beta 1 and is <a href="http://www.wptavern.com/how-to-insert-links-inside-of-image-captions">something I, and many others</a> have wanted within WordPress for a long time. This little addition will make it a breeze to add attribution to images when performing an image only post. There are under the hood improvements as well but what I&#8217;ve covered here should be a good start. </p>\n<p>No related posts.</p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/NqpNZ8jbZ78" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 05 Apr 2012 16:49:51 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:57:"Weblog Tools Collection: WordPress Theme Releases for 4/5";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/?p=11241";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~3/wdStZ19PAkM/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:871:"<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11242" title="ascetica" src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/ascetica.png" alt="" width="150" height="113" /></p>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/ascetica"><strong>Ascetica</strong></a> is a simple portfolio and blog theme with a responsive layout, sticky posts slider, and a widget for presenting your work.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11243" title="reno" src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/reno.png" alt="" width="150" height="113" /></p>\n<p><a href="http://emptynestthemes.com/2012/04/04/reno-theme/"><strong>Reno</strong></a> has a color scheme usually associated with building trades and a leather texture background.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~4/wdStZ19PAkM" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 05 Apr 2012 15:30:07 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5:"James";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:30:"Dev Blog: WordPress 3.4 Beta 1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=2250";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:55:"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/04/wordpress-3-4-beta-1/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2489:"<p>WordPress 3.4 is ready for beta testers!</p>\n<p>As always, this is software still in development and <strong>we don’t recommend that you run it on a production site</strong> — set up a test site just to play with the new version.

For those of you who have been looking for a WordPress Multisite reference book to help get you started, Mika Epstein and Andrea Rennick have <a href="http://tech.ipstenu.org/ebooks/wordpress-multisite-101/">co-authored a book</a> specifically for WordPress Multisite. The book contains over 40 pages of information ranging from installation to configuration. However, one of the more interesting aspects of the book is that the price tag is PWYW otherwise known as Pay What You Want. Mika suggests $5.00 but it&#8217;s not a mandatory amount. Since Sunday, she has seen over 500 downloads of the book while earning $150.00. With that said, the book has been released under a Creative Commons Non-Commercial license which basically means you can use it on your website, put it within the Codex, give it away to someone, but what you can&#8217;t do <a href="http://ipstenu.org/2012/my-ebook-is-pwyw/">is make money from it</a>. I encourage you to read her take on why she released the book as is. </p>\n<p>I think one of the things worth taking away from this little experience is that code is GPL, text is not. </p>\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/situations-in-which-multisite-should-not-be-used" rel="bookmark" title="Situations In Which MultiSite Should Not Be Used">Situations In Which MultiSite Should Not Be Used</a></li>\n</ol></p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/SHKoRPUvB9Q" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 03 Apr 2012 13:00:27 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:39:"WPTavern: Webhosting With Free Shipping";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=6481";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:91:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/xZkvp6V6EkY/webhosting-with-free-shipping";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:309:"<p>He&#8217;s right, I&#8217;ve never seen webhosting <a href="http://blog.page.ly/2012/03/a-hosting-industry-first-page-ly-now-with-free-shipping/">offer free shipping</a> until now. </p>\n<p>No related posts.</p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/xZkvp6V6EkY" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 02 Apr 2012 17:00:06 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:61:"Weblog Tools Collection: Task Management for WordPress and P2";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/?p=11229";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~3/146qcjtqzac/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1178:"<p>Are you looking for a way to easily manage tasks either for yourself, your team, or perhaps even your entire company?

I find that to be incredible and reminds me that the software not only has a big following here in the U.S. but has a much bigger following outside of the English language. </p>\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/handful-of-codex-stats" rel="bookmark" title="Handful Of Codex Stats">Handful Of Codex Stats</a></li>\n</ol></p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/3-dkHQyI9JY" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 02 Apr 2012 13:00:21 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:57:"Weblog Tools Collection: WordPress Theme Releases for 4/1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/?p=11224";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~3/Bad3ABroh48/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:931:"<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11225" title="thebootstrap" src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/thebootstrap.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="113" /></p>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/the-bootstrap"><strong>The Bootstrap</strong></a> is based on <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a> from Twitter and features a 100% responsive layout, a superb gallery and image handling, and a clean and simple design.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11226" title="optical" src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/optical.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="113" /></p>\n<p><a href="http://emptynestthemes.com/2012/03/31/optical-wordpress-theme/"><strong>Optical</strong></a> is a rich, moody, vibrant, and edgy theme.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~4/Bad3ABroh48" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sun, 01 Apr 2012 14:00:56 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5:"James";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"Weblog Tools Collection: WordPress Multisite Pay-What-You-Want eBook";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/?p=11221";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~3/9GB8oOtBMNQ/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1228:"<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> is one of the simplest self-hosted blogging platforms around, but <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network">working with multisite</a> is a different beast altogether.

Over the past few weeks, I&#8217;ve noticed a variety of tutorials that explain how you can add this functionality to WordPress themes. However, I&#8217;m wondering if this is just one of those trends that will go away once Pinterest dies off. For sites such as Pinterest where it makes sense to have an infinite scroll, does it make sense to have that functionality on a regular blog or any other type of website? There is one issue that was brought up within one of the tutorials that I read that mentioned that this technique if done improperly would not scale well. However, Pinterest appears to be doing just fine and they are generating millions of pageviews a week. </p>\n<p>What about pagination? If infinite scroll is introduced to a website, does that negate the need to even have traditional pagination? I would hope so considering I&#8217;d hate to be limited to viewing the archive of posts by wearing out my scroll wheel. What are your thoughts on the infinite scroll? </p>\n<div class="aligncenter">Note: There is a poll embedded within this post, please visit the site to participate in this post''s poll.</div>\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/pin-it-is-the-new-bookmark" rel="bookmark" title="Pin-It Is The New Bookmark">Pin-It Is The New Bookmark</a></li>\n</ol></p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/N47Us6dCM5Q" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 30 Mar 2012 13:00:07 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:75:"Lorelle on WP: Help Needed with WebVisions WordPress Theme Developers Panel";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:36:"http://lorelle.wordpress.com/?p=5885";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:101:"http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2012/03/29/help-needed-with-webvisions-wordpress-theme-developers-panel/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:506:"Webvisions is in Portland, Oregon, May 16-18, 2012, and I&#8217;ll be there again this year leading an awesome panel of WordPress Theme designers and developers, and I need your help.

It&#8217;s a cool plugin but upon reading the directions on how to display the favorite option within specific pages or posts, I was sent back into time because in order to accomplish that task, you need to add specific code to certain template files such as page.php, single.php, etc. I thought that practice of adding plugin functionality was gone but I guess not. </p>\n<p>Related

Ipstenu, one of the volunteer WordPress.org support forum moderators has <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/warning-phishing-attempt">published a forum thread</a> warning others that responding to the email wouldn&#8217;t be a good idea. The way in which this phishing attack works is pretty interesting. After clicking on the link within the email to check on your plugins status, you are then taken to a site that looks very similar to WordPress.org where you&#8217;re asked to provide your password. Passwords that are given can then be used to gain unauthorized access to the account and associated plugins attached to it. </p>\n<p>Plugin authors are encouraged not to reply to the email as well as not entering your password on the fake WordPress.org website. It&#8217;s important to note that plugins have not been removed from the repo, and if they had, the email would have come from a wordpress.org account. </p>\n<p>You might have to jog my memory but this is the first time that I can remember where WordPress.org plugin authors were the target of a phishing scam. </p>\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a

laid out by BloggingPro.com, the question is simple. <a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/archives/2012/03/21/should-you-close-comments-on-older-blog-posts/">Should you close comments on older blog posts?</a> While their article goes into specific reasons as to why or why not, I&#8217;ve personally been a fan of closing comments on articles that are 180 days old. I think the bulk of the conversation that is going to take place on any particular post will be within 7 days of it being published. Therefor, I don&#8217;t feel the need to have the form open if the conversation is over with. Another major reason I opt to go this route is spam. Back when I used to write for other websites, I noticed that the majority of their spam comments were for articles buried deep within their archives. Every now and then, a legitimate comment would show up but that was the exception rather than the rule. As a site administrator, closed comments on older articles also provides an easier administrative role. Instead of wading through pages of comments caught within the Akismet queue to check for false positives, I normally have only a page or two at the most. </p>\n<p>With that said, as a site administrator, how do you have your comments configured and why did you chose that configuration? </p>\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/approve-delete-spam-how-do-you-treat-specific-comments" rel="bookmark" title="Approve, Delete, Spam &#8211; How Do You Treat Specific Comments?">Approve, Delete, Spam &#8211; How Do You Treat Specific Comments?</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/wordpress-disqus-and-spam-comments" rel="bookmark" title="WordPress, Disqus, And Spam Comments">WordPress, Disqus, And Spam Comments</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/managing-comments-with-ajax-edit-comments" rel="bookmark" title="Managing Comments With Ajax Edit Comments">Managing Comments With Ajax Edit Comments</a></li>\n</ol></p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/Kx-vr7Z_KHw" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 23 Mar 2012 17:00:20 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";a:9:{s:6:"server";s:5:"nginx";s:4:"date";s:29:"Thu, 12 Apr 2012 15:41:36 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:15:"application/xml";s:10:"connection";s:5:"close";s:4:"vary";s:15:"Accept-Encoding";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Thu, 12 Apr 2012 15:30:22 GMT";s:14:"content-length";s:5:"82459";s:4:"x-nc";s:11:"HIT luv 139";s:13:"accept-ranges";s:5:"bytes";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20090627192103";}', 'no');

(328, 3, '2012-04-10 15:36:45', '2012-04-10 15:36:45', 'In 1924, as the United States Congress debated the Johnson-Reed immigration act, Senator Ellison Smith of South Carolina took to the Senate floor to assert what he believed to be the country’s need to “shut the door.” “Without offense,” Smith ironically declared, “but with regard to the salvation of our own, let us shut the door and assimilate what we have, and let us breed pure American citizens and develop our own American resources.” While Smith believed this “purity” could best be achieved through immigration restriction harsher than that created by the already restrictive bill on the table, he was willing to vote for the bill’s quotas, as were most of his colleagues. Although Smith’s racist arguments were not indicative of the entire chamber’s calculus for vetting the bill, it was nonetheless approved with overwhelming support and signed into law the same year (“Shut the Door”).\n\nOver 80 years later, a similar scene unfolded in the halls of Congress. During a speech to the House of Representatives in September of 2006 regarding a bill which would strengthen the investigatory powers of law enforcement, Colorado Rep. Tom Tancredo invoked the supposed criminal activity of illegal immigrants in his state to garner support for what he called “our true and one single responsibility” (United States Congress). In effect, the responsibility was to deal with the increasing illegal alien population of the country, a cause with which Tancredo, the Chairman of the House Immigration Reform Caucus and author of <em>In Mortal Danger: The Battle for America’s Border and Security</em>, had long been associated (“Biography”).\n\nThe juxtaposition of these two moments in legislative history offers a glimpse into America’s seemingly never-ending conflict with immigration, particularly illegal immigration. The racism of Smith’s time evolved into the more refined nativist streak in politicians like Tancredo, one which arguably placed him to the right of his colleagues on the issue (like Smith himself). However, such an acknowledgment must be treated cautiously; perhaps the more proper angle from which to consider Tancredo’s position is in relation to the view of the American public. With equal caution, we can submit the Congressional elections of 2006 as the measuring stick with which to gauge the electorate’s perception of illegal immigration and the nativist response it may have drawn in various political circles. More complex but perhaps more relevant would be to view the election as a moment of internal struggle, the latest development of the existential conflict in which the “nation of immigrants” attempts to define itself.\n\nLess than two weeks before the midterm elections, President Bush signed a law authorizing the construction of a 700-mile fence on the border with Mexico. While many critics decried the ludicrous inefficacy and difficulty of the fence’s construction, to the shrewd political observer the intent was not pragmatism but rather political opportunism; Republicans seemed to believe that a platform highlighting immigration control would aid them in the coming election. As Michael Fletcher and Jonathan Weisman of the<em>Washington Post </em>astutely noted, the bill had backed President Bush into a corner, with “international allies and his own immigration principles on one side, and the electoral needs of his party on the other” (A04). Bush’s signing of the law effectively heralded his resignation to the political reality, an acceptance of the fence as willed by the people.\n\nTaking the passage of the fence construction bill as the definitive emergence of immigration as a Republican issue for voters in 2006, we can consider the party’s tactics in passing the law a mixed success. According to the CNN National Exit Poll for the U.S. House, of the 62% of voters who considered illegal immigration either “very” or “extremely” important in 2006, the majority voted for Republican candidates (“U.S. House of Representatives/National/Exit Poll”). On the one hand this figure seems to indicate voters’ recognition of Republican efforts on the immigration issue. However, the significant national net losses by the Republican Party might point to the relegation of the immigration issue among the priorities of the electorate. While it seems likely that the favorable response to the Republican immigration agenda was that party’s reward for pragmatic legislative effort (the mere passage of the fence bill), it is also reasonable to conclude that the average American voter did not undergo a radical ideological shift, such as an adoption of nativism as a guiding philosophy on the issue.\n\nWhether or not the election returns and the polling data on immigration specifically were a referendum on American <em>personal </em>sentiment towards immigrants, the results lend credibility to the notion that American identity is not marked by a prejudicial nativism. Moreover, if the voters approved of Republican immigration policy because of its emphasis on external (at the border) rather than internal control, the results would be in line with larger international trends. According to a study by Angel Solano Garcia which asks, “Does illegal immigration empower rightist parties?” in most developed nations where the issue is framed (and parties distinguished) by level of commitment to border enforcement, voters tend to heavily favor right-wing parties when they connect illegal immigration to a sense of insecurity (652). This projection validates the statistics provided by the CNN exit poll that asked voters what should be done with “most” illegal immigrants currently living in the U.S. 57% of respondents said that illegal residents should be “offered legal status,” while 38% favored deportation (“U.S. House of Representatives/ National/Exit Poll”). The willingness of the majority to grant amnesty (a term as fervently avoided by many politicians as a scarlet letter of treason) in some form to illegal immigrants would seem to preclude any evidence of nativist bias among most voters. Of course, the 38% minority in support of deportation is significant, and we can speculate that those voters responded to the “border security is national security” trope. Even if the distinction between the two responding constituencies is conditioned by the influence of nativism on the part of the minority, it would adhere to Garcia’s model, given the fact that 56% of that minority voted for Republican candidates (“U.S. House of Representatives/National/Exit Poll”).\n\nThe national data is useful to the extent that it can help us form a picture of the average voter’s attitude towards the parties’ portrayal of the illegal immigration issue, as well as their respective success in reconciling pragmatic security concerns with heavier moral ones. By isolating certain races of note in 2006, we can build on that portrait in order to better understand how such considerations were weighed on a more local level. The southwest region is the most likely candidate for closer observation in any immigration study, owing to its higher concentration of illegal immigrants and the tendency for that presence to pervade the realm of state and local politics. In Arizona’s fifth congressional district, the defeat of Rep. J.D. Hayworth was hailed by many supporters of the “path to citizenship” plan for alien residents as a symbolic victory for their cause, part of an overall American repudiation of conservative restrictive policies (Archibold).\n\nAt first glance, it seems reasonable to conclude that voters rejected Hayworth’s relatively “hardline” position on illegal immigration. Hayworth, like Congressman Tancredo, authored a book on the subject entitled <em>Whatever it Takes</em>, which sparked controversy both in his district and nationally for, among other things, its employment of a quotation from Henry Ford (Giblin). In addition, the <em>Arizona Republic</em>, an influential community publication, called Hayworth a “bully,” and asserted that the district needed “a bridge-builder, not a bomb-thrower” (Myers). If we were to assume that these characterizations represent a prevalent view of Hayworth within his district, we would concurrently assume that the voters of the fifth district favored tempered rhetoric and moderation of policy (in the hope that it would lead to pragmatic legislative achievement) over more fiery, divisive postures.\n\nUnfortunately, the presence on the statewide ballot of Proposition 103 complicates such an assessment. Proposition 103, which called for the adoption of English as the official language of Arizona as well as the limitation of multilingual government programs, was passed with 74.2% of the vote (“Voters Make English”). Traditionally, measures such as this one have been perceived as the hallmark of the modern nativist effort. Why then did an overwhelming expression of statewide disapproval for the intrusion of immigrant language into American communities not translate into a victory for Hayworth and his restrictive platform? After all, the characterization of the passage by one leader of the English-first campaign, Mauro Mujica, as Arizona’s call for “assimilation, not separation”, was strikingly reminiscent of what was <em>rejected</em> by many as nativism in Hayworth’s<em>Whatever it Takes </em>(“Voters Make English”). “Instead of Americanization,” Hayworth wrote, current policy offers “bilingual education, racial and ethnic quotas, and education that focuses not on American heroes and culture, but on a potpourri of ethnic heroes and cultures” (qtd. in Giblin).\n\nUnless popular opinion in the 5th district differs extraordinarily from that of Arizona as a whole, it seems clear that Hayworth’s support for “Americanism” rather than so-called “multiculturalism” was not the voters’ chief grievance with their congressman. Overall, Arizonans may have felt that in fact, the defense of English (and perhaps transitively in their minds, the defense of strictly “American” culture) was as essential a tool on the illegal immigration front as physical border security itself. But the fact that Proposition 103 was passed irrespective of party or ideological affiliation—exit polls indicate the measure was approved by 54% and 53% of Democrats and Liberals, respectively—shows that while Hayworth may have been on the right side of the issue for some voters, like many Republicans nationwide he may simply have been a member of the wrong party for this election (“Ballot Measures/Arizona Proposition 103/Exit Poll”).\n\nHowever, even support for Proposition 103 does not lend itself to the embrace of nativism as a guiding philosophy without reservation. Exit polling estimates that 55% of all Arizona voters supported the granting of legal status to current illegal residents (“Ballot Measures/Arizona Proposition 103/Exit Poll”). It is this statistic more than any other that exposes the suggested “existential conflict” over immigration. The stated motives of proponents of Proposition 103 are designed to distance, or even reject, an explicit nativism. Consider the rationale offered by Arizona State Rep. Russell Pearce to voters considering the Proposition that “Official English promotes unity” and “empowers immigrants” (“Ballot argument FOR Proposition 103”). If sincere, these assertions could hardly be considered anti-immigrant. Rather, they, along with Pearce’s contention that the measure will eliminate government waste, appeal to an <em>inclusive</em> persuasion. Therefore, the “existential conflict” is essentially the struggle to reconcile Americans’ tendency towards the so-called “Americanism” and “Americanization” with the previously embraced “melting pot” theory of societal development. The difficulty lies in validating the belief that these new systems allow for an equally smooth and efficient integration of an immigrant population into American communities.\n\nFurther, Rep. Hayworth’s framing of the issue sheds light on the rhetorical ambiguity surrounding this conflict. It is doubtful that most supporters of English-first legislation, such as Mujica, would assert that assimilation through language (and perhaps other responsibilities of American citizenship) mandates the purging of ethnic identity. Rather, their philosophy accepts the ethnic “potpourri,” which Hayworth decried, as a viable part of American life. Indeed, most would maintain that a confluence of ethnic traditions created and continues to create American culture, rather than threaten it. It is clear then that their call for “assimilation” is far more benign than Hayworth’s “Americanization,” which seems to equate the adoption of English with that of an exceedingly narrow view of American identity. And inevitably, this view of identity is based in potentially harmful racial distinctions, rather than inclusive patriotic sentiment.\n\nOf course, Arizona cannot legitimately be considered a microcosm for the entire United States. As the national polling data indicated, American voters may have been less concerned with immigrant integration than Arizonans were when they voted in 2006. Therefore a consideration of a case outside of the southwest, a region we might even consider “tainted” for study given the way in which the economic and cultural effects of immigration may prejudice votes, can be used to return to a more general study of national opinion. The election in the sixth District of Illinois, another one of the key swing races in 2006, may illuminate how illegal immigration was used or misused as an issue among the rest of the electorate.\n\nThe race in the sixth district pitted Democrat Tammy Duckworth, an Iraq war veteran, against Peter Roskam, a Republican state legislator (“The 2006 Campaign”). Not surprisingly given Duckworth’s combat experience, Democratic strategists hoped to use this race to emphasize their party’s commitment to national security and defense issues, which were traditionally in the Republican corner. Also not surprising given the national dissatisfaction with Iraq was Roskam’s refusal to make that war a major focus of his campaign. However, he did not shy away from the issue of illegal immigration, a decision which ultimately may have greatly helped him secure victory. Roskam opposed the “path to citizenship” legislation and supported fence construction on the border (“Border Security/Illegal Immigration”).\n\nBy conventional standards, Roskam’s decision to incorporate immigration into the debate is rather puzzling. Considering the overall national distaste for the Republican record, sticking to the prevailing wisdom of treating local issues primarily in a House race would have been the logical strategy. If a Republican candidate were to widen the discourse to the national scale, they would open themselves up to attacks based more on party affiliation than on personal record. However, Roskam did just that, allowing illegal immigration to come into play as the primary issue in the national security field.\n\nIt was certainly not the issue Democrats had hoped would emerge. But the question remains: why would voters respond favorably to Roskam’s posturing on illegal immigration when the issue affected their district only tangentially? While we cannot assume that Roskam won solely on this point of contention, it undoubtedly played a role in his victory. One reasonable inference is that the voters of the Illinois 6th considered immigration an<em>economic</em> threat first and foremost. Perhaps the same protectionist sentiment ridden by some Democratic candidates, such as Rep. Sherrod Brown in the Ohio Senate race, to victory in 2006 aided Roskam in this case in the sense that voters were attentive to the potential economic consequences of expanded immigration and amnesty. If voters supported Roskam’s campaign platform, which stated, “We are a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of laws,” we can identify a new voice in the existential debate, one that hearkens to the call of immigration control not out of bias or even the integration of “Americanism” (“Border Security/Illegal Immigration”). Rather, this constituency responds to a sense of “crowding”—the imposition of immigrant economic needs (not cultural ones) on the country. As the sixth district shows us, the crowding can be just as potent hundreds of miles from the source.\n\nWhile the 2006 Election failed to produce a clear consensus on immigration, it cemented the status of the issue as far more complex and relevant than previous agents of electoral polarization. Indeed, we now see that immigration is not a polemic of the same fabric as the much-hyped “moral values” debate of 2004; the issue is impaired by hyperbole yet rejects the tendency to divide along traditional regional and social contours. The identity crisis observed among the American electorate is one which will continue to compound the national immigration debate, fostering a confused politics in which voters are unable to define themselves according to philosophies traditionally recognized by politicians. Still, perhaps only by recognizing the impossibility of settling this internal discord—of reaching a cultural consensus—will we reject the disquieting politics of anxiety that currently reigns in public discourse.\n\n&nbsp;', 'A Conflict of Culture or Conscience: Re-reading the 2006 Election', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '271-autosave', '', '', '2012-04-10 15:36:45', '2012-04-10 15:36:45', '', 271, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?p=328', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

[…] The youthful essayist usually develops into the professional anecdotalist, with an active mind that is harnessed up to no real thinking but can only stream off from itself a futile current of incident” (506). This is a strange—even a disheartening—sentiment to hear from Bourne, an essayist who never made it to sanguine middle age himself. He was writing, however, about the "light essay," a form of the essay that was epitomized by such well known writers as Charles Lamb. But Bourne, while insightful about many things, including the dangers of American thinkers tacitly approving the first World War, because they did not sufficiently consider what it asked us to rethink about democracy itself, was wrong about the essay. And Bourne also here fails to mention his own first attempts to do "real thinking" in essays in the Columbia Monthly, including articles on X, Y, and Z. If Bourne were a first year student at Columbia today, I would guess that he would be a prolific blogger, and would seek out as many opportunities for explorations of his ideas in public as he could.\r\n\r\nTo write an essay to an imagined (and actual) audience of smart readers who are not familiar with the particulars of the issues that concern oneself, but who can become interested by them is no small feat. To write both persuasively, thoughtfully, responsibly about questions about contemporary topics ranging from use of placebos trials to the complexity of drag performance, or the lasting effects of DADT despite its revocation situates the student writer as a person who can and should speak/write publicly on these issues--not to simply express his or her opinions, but to begin the heady process of entering into an existing intellectual conversation and exchange of ideas.\r\n\r\nThere is a genre called the essay which is particularly flexible and able to accomodate a wide range of subjects, writerly stances, aesthetic experiments and argumentative strategies. It is the essay''s diversity that this publication showcases and celebrates, although we do emphasize essays that make their arguments rather more explicitly than those on the more implicit and elliptical end of the spectrum.\r\n\r\nI am proud and fascinated of the work that students who are new to this form of writing have been able to accomplish with one semester''s worth of hard study of the genre''s requirements. And of all of what essay asks, it most demands that its writers show up and make their thinking visible to others on the page. This is no solipsistic act--the ideas are there because they are meaningful and could be meaningful to others.\r\n\r\nThe Core curriculum at Columbia includes many famous essayists on its curriculum, including both Michel de Montaigne and Francis Bacon. How fitting then that as students begin their study here that they might find a space to conduct their own experiments in thinking in the only course at Columbia that is required of all first year students: University Writing.\r\n\r\nAs you consider the essays in this journal, you might find it interesting to see how even the most timely of or students'' arguments--that respond to key controversies of their day--the Jessica Lynch story, the Borat movie, the RiceTek patenting case feature ideas that are of lasting interest and merit. This is why essays in the world continue to be read long after their timeliness--their kairotic appeals--diminish: because in the presence of a thinker working carefully to craft an idea about a text well known or just discovered, we feel the thrill of a moment of invention. In essays these moments are not preserved or fixed but recreated, and the force of the best essays by writers regardless of their age is that of the click--the idea that was nascent and only dimmly detected made visible and sharable with others. The art of the essay is alive and well at Columbia and we look forward to many more volumes of The Morningside Review to show us of what new essaysists in our midsts can contribute to the form.\r\n\r\nWith all best wishes,\r\nNicole B.

And of all of what essay asks, it most demands that its writers show up and make their thinking visible to others on the page. This is no solipsistic act--the ideas are there because they are meaningful and could be meaningful to others.\r\n\r\nThe Core curriculum at Columbia includes many famous essayists on its curriculum, including both Michel de Montaigne and Francis Bacon. How fitting then that as students begin their study here that they might find a space to conduct their own experiments in thinking in the only course at Columbia that is required of all first year students: University Writing.\r\n\r\nAs you consider the essays in this journal, you might find it interesting to see how even the most timely of or students'' arguments--that respond to key controversies of their day--the Jessica Lynch story, the Borat movie, the RiceTek patenting case feature ideas that are of lasting interest and merit. This is why essays in the world continue to be read long after their timeliness--their kairotic appeals--diminish: because in the presence of a thinker working carefully to craft an idea about a text well known or just discovered, we feel the thrill of a moment of invention. In essays these moments are not preserved or fixed but recreated, and the force of the best essays by writers regardless of their age is that of the click--the idea that was nascent and only dimmly detected made visible and sharable with others. The art of the essay is alive and well at Columbia and we look forward to many more volumes of The Morningside Review to show us of what new essaysists in our midsts can contribute to the form.\r\n\r\nWith all best wishes,\r\nNicole B.

(400, 8, '2012-02-27 02:39:40', '2012-02-27 02:39:40', '“You betrayed millions of readers.” With these words, Oprah confronted the author who had aroused a storm of controversy in the literary world. His name was James Frey, and, in four short months, his new best-selling memoir, A Million Little Pieces, had come under extreme scrutiny. The problem was that James Frey’s memoir was not a memoir at all—he had dramatized large sections of his life, in one instance expanding his hours in jail to three months. Frey fueled an already fiery debate over artistic license and dramatic rendering in the “non-fiction” genres of memoir and autobiography. How rigidly can and should authors adhere to the facts when recounting their life stories? By examining The Diary of Anne Frank as an emblematic work of the genre, it becomes clear that the faithful recounting of one’s own life is extremely difficult, if not impossible.\n\nThe world of self-narratives is often chaotic and blurry. Author Tom Sykes ironically announced in the Guardian that “fake memoirs are all the rage,” and publishers have created genre after genre of “autobiographical novel,” “semi-autobiographical novel,” “roman à clef,” and “nonfiction novel.” The ambiguity lies in autobiography’s presentational aim. Autobiography involves not only the portrayal of one’s life, but also “the construction of a public self” (Goffman 26). Erving Goffman asserts in The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life that each person takes on a role that they present to the world. In the process of self-representation, a conflict of interest arises: an author is tempted “to lie and to exaggerate,” to construct his or her own character. Although autobiography implies a “true” representation of the author’s life, language “always contains the possibility of lying” (Spicer 386). In the attempt to fashion a life into an interesting, readable book, autobiography takes on an “uneasy relation to fiction,” and this makes its factuality highly questionable.\n\nIf the autobiography is stripped of its self-consciousness—the motivation to dramatize, shape, and inflate—a unique genre, objective and factual, presumably emerges. The diary seems to stand alone in its claim to pure introspection. Philippe Lejeune, a French specialist of autobiography, lists the four functions of a diary: self-expression, reflection, the suspension of time, and the potential for pleasure from the writing process (Lejeune 106). The author pens a diary not for another’s entertainment or guidance, but for him- or herself. There is an element of secrecy that autobiographies lack in their exhibitionism—many people have memories of hiding childhood journals from parents. Where the autobiography thrives in its outward direction, in its desire to communicate with a world of readers, the diary begins as an inward turn; the writer is “alone, unable to pour it out to a friendly ear” (Lejune 106). Without the social obligation to present a coherent face and personality, a diarist can theoretically be honest with their dullness, their shortcomings, and their contradictions. The vacuum of pretensions should expose the true human being, stripped down and humbled.\n\nIn practice however, capturing an authentic experience proves much more difficult. Anne Frank’s diary points to the fluid relationship between the diary and the autobiography. The intertwining of the two genres begins with an author’s shifting intentions. When Frank first receives a blank, plaid journal at the age of thirteen, she intends it for her personal support and perusal. She writes, “I hope I shall be able to confide in you completely, as I have never been able to do in anyone before, and I hope that you will be a great support and comfort to me” (Frank 177). The word, “confide,” confers a secretive dimension to her writing. When she mentions that others, curious for a peek, have asked to read her diary, she describes their requests as breaches of her privacy. Frank seeks to relay her deeper feelings and thoughts through the most unassuming of mediums.\n\nFrank first mentions the idea of publishing her work when she hears a radio reporter suggest “a collection of diaries and letters after the war” (Frank 578). However, she moves on from this idea, or perhaps misinterprets it, to instead muse upon “Een roman van het Achterhuis,” or “a romance of the ‘Secret Annexe.’” The Dutch word, “roman,” more accurately translates into “novel” in English (Caplan 81), and it is here that the reader first glimpses Frank’s changing intentions. She sees that her diary will help with her “greatest wish . . . to become a journalist someday and later on a famous writer” (Frank 647). After constructing these plans, Frank’s diary takes on a new dimension: it no longer serves a merely personal function, but now provides the catalyst for Frank’s dream of becoming a celebrated author. She sees her diary as the foundation for a novel, a genre of fiction, and this vision, above all else, cements her decision to revise her entries.\n\nFrank proclaims, “I want to go on living after my death!” (Frank 647). And so she begins editing her earlier entries, adding, deleting, and rewording. Her revisions mimic the process of producing autobiography by reflecting upon the past. Autobiography looks back, “so if something escapes you, it’s the origin, not the ending” (Lejeune 103). In the act of revision, one inserts insights only later received and reconciles inconsistencies. In contrast, diarists are rooted in the present: there is no lapse in time between experiencing and reflecting on paper, and the diarist’s stories—his or her life—obviously lack an “ending.” The future “slips away . . . by showing up once again in the beyond.” (Lejeune 103). Although Frank’s original entries indeed unfold over the course of her time in the Annex and “she writes without knowing for certain the end of her story” (Caplan 81), she foresees an eventual ending. On May 20, 1944, she enthuses, “I have started my ‘Achterhuis.’ It is as good as finished” (Frank 653). The diarist always drives on, as the writing has no plot or form but the “shape of death” (Lejeune 103), Frank’s work possesses a direction. Her Het Achterhuis cannot live past her time at the Annex. In creating a conclusion for her diary, she enables herself to reflect, reexamine, and reshape her own story.\n\nFrom May to July of 1944, Frank edited her two previous years of entries. The Critical Edition separates Frank’s work into separate drafts—the a-text includes her originals, the b-text contains her own revisions, and the c-text the published version. These versions “set the Diary in a no-man’s-land between fiction and memoir” (Caplan 81). What Frank seeks to accomplish in altering her diary is to enhance its drama and artistic value. She seeks “to make the Diary both more vivid (pleasurable) and more public (useful) (Caplan 82). She simultaneously recalls and creates reality by rewriting a more explicit experience of everyday life. She injects into paragraphs the interruptions of daily life, the casual exclamations, and spur-of-the-moment observations. In most cases, a small addition along the lines of “it is so peaceful at the moment” (Frank 185) suffices, but her edits involving her family’s arrest prove much more heavy-handed.\n\nHer original entry on the event spans two paragraphs and only briefly captures the shock. She summaries her feelings with a concise, single sentence: “Of course I started to cry terribly and there was an awful to-do in our house” (Frank 207). When she revisits this text two years later, however, she unabashedly sells the fear and the despair of the situation. She alters the narrative structure, foreshadowing the soldiers’ entry before the arrest. She ends it with a cryptic, “hurried interjection of the present tense” (Caplan 82): “There goes the doorbell, Hello’s here, I’ll stop.” The audience is later led to the horrifying discovery that this visitor is actually the policeman and feels like they are there to witness it all.\n\nThe revised entry detailing the actual arrest expands greatly beyond the original and spans five pages. This time, Frank recounts in vivid detail her heightened emotions, the hour-by-hour developments, and the arduous task of packing. She speaks in fearful language—“I picture concentration camps and lonely cells” (Frank 207)—and describes her surroundings with attentiveness: “The stripped beds, the breakfast things lying on the table, a pound of meat in the kitchen for the cat” (Frank 210). The palpable suspense and the colorful scenes that seemingly unfold in real-time dramatize the story for an audience. When, after the arrest, she writes in the b-text, “Years seem to have passed between Sunday and now,” one wonders if she saw the irony. Years did pass between that fateful Sunday and the penning of that sentence—two, to be exact.\n\nWith the decision to publicize a text, there suddenly appears the recognition of an audience. The process of composing a diary for presentation involves not only the enhancing of literary content, but also the censorship of sensitive entries. Frank never intends for her audience to glimpse the immaturity and idealism that comes with adolescence. She writes at fifteen, “When I look over my diary today, 1 ½ years on . . . I no longer understand how I could write so freely . . . I really blush with shame when I read the pages dealing with subjects that I’d much better have left to the imagination. I put it all down so bluntly!” (Frank 305). Her “shame” refers to her entries on puberty (Frank 567) along with her romance with Peter van Pels, and she relieves this shame by removing a considerable number of these diaries.\n\nHer original entries on Peter are long and detailed. She writes as a young teenage girl, infatuated and exuberant at her first taste of love. “Oh, Peter, just say something at last, don’t let me drift on between hope and dejection” (Frank 526), she gushes. Naturally, after her enchantment fades, she feels inclined to excise entire months of entries that reference her preoccupation with him. She recreates her own adolescence, turning a “private diary into a public document” (Caplan 79). Even as a young author, Frank understands how text and identity merge: the diary serves as her reader’s only source for judging her character.\n\nIn moving form the a-text to the b-text, Frank frequently censors herself to control her identity. However, one can only guess at her ultimate plan, as she was never able to finish her work. Publishers, however, continued where she left off, interpreting, editing, and repackaging the author to fit their perceptions and preferences. In particular, there is a “de-judaisation” of her work in moving from the b-text to the c-text, as Rachel Feldhay Brenner discusses in “Anne Frank’s Portrait as a Young Artist.” She champions Het Achterhuis as “an extraordinary piece of writing produced by an extraordinary writer under extraordinary circumstances” (Brenner 109). Frank herself testifies to the significance of her identity and acknowledges “awareness of the terrifying historical reality against which, as a Jew, she writes her life story” (Brenner 109). In her diary, Frank comments, “It would be quite funny 10 years after the war if we Jews were to tell how we lived and what we ate and talked about here” (Frank 578). “We Jews,” she proclaims. Her work centers around her individual life story, but this story is inextricably connected to her Judaism. She recognizes her narrative’s indebtedness to this particular identity.\n\nThe publisher’s presentation of the diary largely overlooks her identification as a Jewish author. Of all translations, the Dutch edition alone preserves Frank’s original title. The English paperback, in contrast, calls itself, Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl. The first distortion is that of genre—Frank never intended to publish a diary, and her thorough edits reflect her intentions. Translators and editors, in “calling it a ‘diary’ . . . have perpetuated Anne’s own fiction of a day-to-day journal” (Caplan 79). More significantly, however, the title places “the content in the realm of the ‘normal’” (Brenner 106) when much of the diary seeks to relay the horrors of a war. Similarly, the synopsis on the back cover of the first English paperback edition suppresses the extraordinary for the ordinary, summarizing that “her story is that of every teen-ager” and focusing mainly on her relationship with Peter (Brenner 110). Frank loses her Jewish identity, and the book becomes a coming-of-age romance. She transforms into a generic “symbol of universal victimization and . . . prevailing humanism” (Brenner 110) that fails to capture an essential piece of her story: she is Jewish and narrates a specifically Jewish experience. To deny this obscures “the difference between Anne and other teen-agers” (Bernstein 2).\n\nThe life story encounters obstacles to truth at every step of its formation. The diarist falls prey to bias from the start. Anne Frank’s diary fails as a diary, as considerations for self-presentation are found within the text itself. The diary in full a-text form doesn’t even exist—there are no multiple drafts of entries after the day she conceives of Het Achterhuis, implying that from then on she writes with full acknowledgment of an audience. How does one then confront the problem of inaccuracy in portraying the events of one’s life? One may follow the lead of publishers and dissect the autobiography into minute, arbitrary, and often indistinguishable genres. One may lambast Anne Frank for her extrapolations and proclaim her a fraud. However, to argue in this manner misses the point. At the end of Frank’s diary, one leaves not with the remembrance of the embellished details of the war, but with the sentiments she inspires that cannot be falsified. She remains alive today precisely because she is presented, albeit inaccurately so, as an ordinary girl coming of age in times radically different yet still somehow familiar. Texts, like both Frank’s and Frey’s, find their significance and power in more than the words themselves. It is the authenticity of the emotions that penetrate the minds of readers, with a little help from some harmless “lies.”', 'Anne Frank: Finding the Truth (and Lies) in Diary-Writing', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '259-autosave', '', '', '2012-02-27 02:39:40', '2012-02-27 02:39:40', '', 259, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?p=400', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

In the January of 1934, Shostakovich’s opera “Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk” was given its world premiere and was embraced by audiences and critics alike. The opera tells the story of a lonely, suppressed woman who falls in love with one of her abusive husband’s workers and is driven to murder. It is steeped in violence, sexuality and the macabre. The opera played for hundreds of performances and became so renowned that Josef Stalin, leader of the Communist party, attended a performance in 1936. Stalin did not stay for the whole performance, disgusted at what he had seen. The next day, Shostakovich awoke to find his previously hailed national treasure vilified and condemned in Pravda, the state newspaper. Soon after, he was denounced as a composer and began being monitored by the authorities. At this time, it was very common for Soviet artists, viewed as subversive and in opposition to the cultural values of the Communist party, to be exiled or executed. In fact, many of Shostakovich’s colleagues and family had met that very fate (McBurney 286-287).\r\n\r\nShostakovich needed to write another work to save himself, a work that would meet the Soviet standards of socialist realism and heroism. A year later, Shostakovich completed his Fifth Symphony, which consisted of four movements. Shostakovich decided to subtitle the work “A Soviet Artist’s Response To Justified Criticism.” It was commonly viewed as his last chance to save himself from imminent destruction, and it did just that. Not only did the symphony touch its public audiences, but it also satisfied the demands of the authorities (Wilson 158-159). In contrast to what he did in his previous works, Shostakovich used a more traditional approach to composition, employing a conservative structure and minimizing abrasive dissonances and grotesque musical effects. While the first movement has a reclusively meditative quality and the subdued third movement exudes an emotional fragility, Shostakovich incorporated many lighter moments; the entire second movement is an homage to the waltz and the final movement begins heroically and ends triumphantly. How can I, as a contemporary listener, interpret this work, which satisfied the ideals of the Soviet authorities yet deeply resonated with his suppressed compatriots?\r\n\r\nIn “Behind the Official Story,” James Scott addresses the dynamics of power relations and their impact on communication between dominant and subordinate groups. Scott refers to the open interaction between these groups as a “public transcript,” a discourse “shaped to appeal to the expectations of the powerful” (2). He notes that this public transcript becomes more skewed towards the dominant side as the disparity in power increases. Scott writes that “The theatrical imperatives that normally prevail in situations of domination produce a public transcript in close conformity with how the dominant group would wish to have things appear” (4). He argues that the effects of power relations manifest themselves most clearly in the public transcript, and that a cursory understanding of this interaction suggests that the subordinate groups accept the conditions of their interactions and become “willing, even enthusiastic, partners in the subordination” (4). The dynamics of Shostakovich’s interactions with his oppressors, the Soviet authorities, can be understood through the composition and reception of his work. The pressures exerted by the authorities compelled Shostakovich to write his Fifth Symphony using a simpler and more conservative architecture. However, as Scott himself acknowledges, it is difficult to judge the intent of the oppressed solely from an interpretation of the public transcript: “Without a privileged peek backstage or a rupture in the performance we have no way of calling into question the status of what might be a convincing but feigned performance” (4). And so, to analyze such situations, he introduces the idea of a hidden transcript, a discourse that contains the thoughts and feelings that cannot manifest themselves in the public transcript, and that are harbored individually and more often collectively by the subordinate group.\r\n\r\nShostakovich’s personal and artistic integrity, as well as an understanding of his role as a public figure could not allow him to fully cater to the Soviet Union’s desires. As a man of his time and a voice for his people and his country, his compositions embodied the controversy and tragedy by which millions of people lived day by day. During his rule of the Soviet Union, Josef Stalin sent upwards of thirty million people to their deaths and suppressed the basic rights of many more. Shostakovich wrote his music for every family missing a loved one, every mother who lost a child, and every human being whose unalienable rights, freedom and individuality had been trampled upon. The people had neither the voice nor the strength to cry out loud; Shostakovich did it for them, sharing their hidden transcript. His music provided the mass grieving and cathartic release that his suppressed countrymen needed. He made it his responsibility, even when his own life was at stake, to carry the people’s burdens on his shoulders.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, a public expression of the hidden transcript would bring about “one of those rare and dangerous moments in power relations” (6). Scott implies that the explicit expression of these views would create a power crisis and prompt a potentially violent response. Shostakovich’s Fifth Symphony does not explicitly dictate the hidden transcript, nor does it instigate a conflict. However, audiences have long found emotional solace in the work, viewing it as a statement of resistance against Stalin.\r\n\r\nThis is what makes “A Soviet Artist’s Response to Justified Criticism” so intriguing. Scott’s essay implies that the public transcript and hidden transcript can only be expressed in a mutually exclusive way. His political analysis of the open relationship between the dominant and subordinate does not account for cases where the public and hidden transcripts can be expressed through one medium. Yet, it seems clear that the Fifth Symphony meets the requirements of the public transcript <em>while at the same time</em> subtly presenting the hidden transcript. The public nature of the work and the attention the work received from the authorities prevent us from disregarding its role in furthering the public transcript even as it comforted the masses.\r\n\r\nShostakovich’s symphony allows us to simultaneously examine the public and hidden transcripts. The fourth movement of the symphony begins with an upbeat and heroic character, a necessity considering the mourning quality of the third movement; without the triumphant ending, his symphony would not have appeased the Soviet authorities.  A bleak ending to the piece would hardly create the veneer of Soviet pride. As the opening march-like theme picks up in speed, waves of triumph come from throughout the orchestra. The excitement swells until the action comes to a sudden halt. What follows is a long, slow passage with a searching feeling, as though Shostakovich is paying respect to what has been left behind at the cost of the fanfare. A traditional symphony would follow this section with a return to the original theme, expressing the polarity of dark and light. Shostakovich does bring back the first march theme, but at a drastically slower pace. In doing so, he presents a shift in character in the theme, from willing celebration, to a solemn, obligatory funeral march. From here, the music journeys from the darker key of D minor to the lighter key of D major. However, the journey is not an easy one: with much difficulty, the orchestra climbs registers reaching high pitches, clinging on to the weight of the D minor tonality. The violins make their last stand, repeatedly stating the same high note, while the brass instruments burst out with pitches that create dissonance with the violins, highlighting the tension and resistance to accepting the joyous transformation to D major. Finally, the orchestra relents and the will of D major prevails. Shostakovich majestically presents and repeats a fragment from the original march theme, transposed from the key of struggle (D minor) to the key of triumph (D major). The struggle appears to be over, with the forces of socialist heroism prevailing over its enemies, but Shostakovich does not finish the symphony. He complicates the expected happy ending by tampering with the final cadence. He changes the penultimate note of the cadence from a B to a B flat, momentarily bringing us to the pathos of D minor. By changing just one note, he throws the brilliance of the conclusion into question. To magnify this point, he repeats the same phrase once more and again changes the penultimate note. Finally, the cadence resolves to the D major chord, and the ecstatic chord is repeatedly triumphantly by the brass and accompanied by the timpani. Does the symphony end with the conflict resolved? Or does it remind us of the continuation of the struggle? Regardless of the conclusion made by the listener, it is clear that Shostakovich expressed both the public transcript and the hidden transcript through the same work. The duality is essential to the listener in order to understand the juxtaposition of the darker moments and brighter sections, appreciate the veiled sarcasm of the work and gain a circumscribing understanding of the pathos of Soviet Russia at the end of the 1930s.\r\n\r\nScott’s views on the dynamics of open discourse through the lens of public and hidden transcripts cannot take into account Shostakovich’s Fifth Symphony, and by extension, the dynamics of Shostakovich’s interactions with his oppressors. Scott does not comment on how art can fit into the examination of power relations and the effect they have on our lives. Art, it seems, has the potential to express the public and hidden transcripts simultaneously. This realization, provoked by Scott’s essay, gives birth to another question that, as an aspiring musician, I must ask myself: What is the role and responsibility of an artist, in light of such a work?\r\n\r\nShostakovich has been a highly influential figure in my musical life. I first encountered his music as a twelve year old, playing the second violin part of his Eighth String Quartet. I was drawn to the emotional power and darkness of the work and driven to learn more about the quartet and the composer. With a renewed appreciation for the aesthetic and pathos of his works, I began to explore and perform his piano pieces, symphonies, and string quartets. When I was seventeen, I decided to learn Shostakovich’s First Violin Concerto, one of the most profound works in the solo violin literature. I was fortunate to have the opportunity to perform the work as soloist with symphony orchestra. For forty minutes, I became the medium for Shostakovich’s message, guiding the audience through the darkest depths of the coldest hour of the night, the tossing and turning of a tormented epoch, a grief-stricken yet defiant funeral march, and a sarcastically boisterous burlesque. As I explored the powerful soundscape, the fear and suppression of his distant world became real to me.\r\n\r\nHaving performed his works and experienced the impact and power of his music, I have realized that the genius of Shostakovich doesn’t lie in his technical abilities and innovations as a composer, but in his sense of responsibility to his people and his desire to express protest for those who had suffered and died. As Scott writes: “The first open statement of a hidden transcript, a declaration that breaches the etiquette of power relations, that breaks an apparently calm surface of silence and consent, carries the force of a symbolic declaration of war” (8). Shostakovich’s admirable dedication pushes me to keep my work in perspective: I strive to become a more capable and sensitive artist, not only to be a better violinist or to be satisfied with myself, but also to address the issues of my time and attempt to alleviate the burdens of others. Shostakovich was not a traditional hero; he could neither feed an orphan nor clothe a family, but he could make life more tolerable for those who suffered so much.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'A Soviet Artist’s Response to Justified Criticism: Examining the Realities of Domination and Resistance', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'a-soviet-artists-response-to-justified-criticism-examining-the-realities-of-domination-and-resistance', '', '', '2012-04-11 18:33:08', '2012-04-11 18:33:08', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=510', 0, 'essay', '', 0),

In 1997, the American corporation RiceTec patented Basmati rice, arguably appropriating a cultural staple into a generic brand. Through the lens of the patenting of Basmati rice, and by employing the work of Jonathan Lethem, Siva Vaidhyanathan, and Marilyn Randall, I will attempt to bring into focus the cultural context, conflict, and significance that is manifest in not only this controversy of appropriation, but within international patent law in general. I will show that when we turn our focus away from the economic and legal sides of this debate, and focus on the cultural implications, the essence of what we will find is a cultural power struggle.\r\n\r\nA close examination of this controversy will reveal conflicts between different ideologies of ownership, elements of theft, and colonialism within a particular cultural context.  RiceTec’s patenting of basmati rice is based upon European ideas and traditions of ownership that are foreign to the culture that cultivated and nurtured basmati.  If we understand basmati to be a cultural resource, then its appropriation is a blatant theft of one of India’s most prized goods. This attempt at appropriation, which was committed by a Western entity and founded on Western legal concepts, can then be seen as an example of 21st century cultural colonialism.\r\n\r\nFarming, and the food it produces, is a source of culture, history and pride for people around the world. Just as farmers are inevitably bound to their land, so to is their culture bound to their crops.  The corn, wheat, and rice we eat today are both the products and reflections of their cultural contexts, each occupying an important place in cultural traditions. Basmati rice is one such artifact.  For thousands of years basmati rice has been grown in the foothills of the Himalayas. As cultures do with traditional foods, each generation of Indians pass down basmati rice to the next. It represents far more than the region’s main source of daily calories and grain exports, however. Basmati is used in religious ceremonies, weddings, and has even been the subject of poetry for hundreds of years (Arora 3). It is an inextricable component of Indian culture.\r\n\r\nSo when RiceTec filed U.S. patent number 5,663,454 in 1997, claiming basmati as its own, the region erupted. What followed was an intense, international legal battle that spawned several movements and began a continuing discussion about intellectual property rights and the economic repercussions of what was soon termed “bio-piracy” (Shiva).\r\n\r\nRiceTec claimed it had created an original kind of rice by crossbreeding a basmati strain with a semi-dwarf strain of rice (Arora 4). This “new” strain of rice had one major advantage beyond simply being patentable: it was more durable and suitable to other climates than was traditional basmati. This meant that the natural monopoly that India and Indian farmers had had over basmati rice for millennia was about to be lost. In response, the Indian government, accompanied by Indian scientists and activists, mounted a strong campaign and challenged the ruling in the courts. In 2001 RiceTec’s patent claims were struck down (Arora 5), and in some ways the crisis was averted. Despite this outcome there remains a great deal of significance to this event that is important to consider.\r\n\r\nThe RiceTec patent can be understood as an attempt at cultural de-contextualization and as a very real clash of cultures and of cultural norms. In order to analyze this conflict we must first outline the different cultural norms that inform different conceptions of intellectual property.  Siva Vaidhyanathan, a writer, cultural historian and media scholar at the University of Virginia, claims in “Hep Cats and Copy Cats” that the cultural value systems that inform non-European-derived traditions of ownership often differ from the more linear or “progressive” value system that “emanates from the European artistic tradition and informs European and American copyright law” (Vaidhyanathan 125).  The European tradition emphasizes individual ownership and creativity, whereas non-European-derived traditions tend towards a more communal conception.\r\n\r\nThis difference in conceptions of ownership helps to explain how the RiceTec patent resulted in as a clash of cultures. The cultural context from which basmati was appropriated was inherently different from the world that conceived patent and property law. Jonathan Lethem examines the culture surrounding the ideas of intellectual property in his essay “The Ecstasy of Influence,” where he debates the concept of, what he calls, the “public commons.” This is a metaphorical place where ideas belong between people (Lethem 66), and are passed down like any other cultural tradition. While Lethem is discussing a purely intellectual realm, the concept is entirely applicable to the cultural context in which basmati rice originated. Basmati rice was not the property of any one farmer, or any group of farmers alone. It was never owned in the way that the Western world conceives of private property. Basmati rice is a symbol of cultural heritage, not just another crop or export item. It has inherent cultural value to the entire community to which it belongs that surpasses its quantifiable value on the international grain market.\r\n\r\nA parallel to this cultural understanding of ownership is outlined in Vaidhyanathan’s work as well. While Vaidhyanathan refers exclusively to music, we can see the same cultural norms at work. Before basmati rice was patented, it existed—like the elements of Blues music—“for any skilled and practiced performer to borrow and put to use” (Vaidhyanathan 121). Both Lethem and Vaidhyanathan refer to cultural realms and resources that were never governed by theories of individual property rights or conceptions of individual ownership. Basmati’s cultural context was a shared existence; the only restraints of its use were the soil and climate to which it was adapted. It belonged to the entire Himalayan region equally; not to any one group more than another.\r\n\r\nSignificantly, while both Lethem and Vaidhyanathan stress the importance of a “commons,” they have different approaches to explaining where it resides. Lethem’s description is conceptual and expansive, belonging to “everyone and no one” (66). Vaidhyanathan is far more specific, explaining that in Blues music, the resources of “the commons” comes from a very specific and earthly place: “the cotton fields” (Vaidhyanathan 121). He is making an explicit and deeply meaningful cultural and historical reference to the African-American community and the cultural context that invented and cultivated Blues music in America.  Just as Blues music comes from the cotton fields, basmati, in even more tangible ways, comes from the Himalayan rice fields and Indian culture. In other words, “the commons” in Vaidhyanathan’s conception is intended for use by those who have other, even more tangible things in common: culture, identity, and experiences.\r\n\r\nWhen RiceTec patented basmati rice in 1997, it did not remove the particular varieties native to India from “the commons” entirely (because it was a “new” hybridization of the rice, the various strains that existed previously in India were not affected). While this might appear to honor the concept of “the commons,” within Vaidhyanathan‘s conception it does quite the opposite. The issue at stake here is not simply a matter of whether or not Indian farmers can still grow and cultivate their cultural heritage; it is the fact that their cultural heritage was being appropriated and essentially exported by a foreign entity. This appropriation then becomes an attempt at cultural de-contextualization.  RiceTec’s patent might not have removed basmati from its place of origin, but by attempting to grow it in other places and contexts, it would have become just another globalized product, and not the rare cultural resource that it is today.\r\n\r\nThat is why it so disconcerting that when one examines the media coverage surrounding this controversy, it is difficult, if not impossible, to find the voice and opinion of the Indian basmati farmer.  (The coverage has allowed Indian intellectuals and cultural authorities like Vandana Shiva to speak out.) As much as one might like to provide a platform for the airing of their grievances and allow them to attest to the cultural significance of basmati, the news coverage of this controversy has focused almost solely on the economic and trade impact of the patent. The absence of the basmati farmers’ voices in the debate is yet another example of how basmati has been culturally de-contextualized. The importance of the very individuals who have cultivated basmati and stand to suffer the greatest from its appropriation have been ignored and ultimately lost amongst the discussion of trade figures and legal concerns.\r\n\r\nRiceTec, in attempting to making basmati a globalized good, was effectively devaluing the cultural uniqueness of basmati. Culture is a finite resource which must be protected. Ironically, there is a Western economic concept called the “tragedy of the commons” that states that a resource left in-common, or unowned, is fated to be abused and depleted by its inevitable overuse. There is no reason we should view the cultural commons from which basmati belongs to be any different. The appropriation of an essential cultural resource like basmati represents the opening salvo in a potentially dangerous trend. If a cultural resource is removed from its context and distributed endlessly throughout the world, the commons from which it came could suffer a tragedy of the cultural commons, depleting the source of its strength.\r\n\r\nIt is important to understand that this type of cultural de-contextualization and appropriation does not represent a new paradigm, but rather a historically recurring theme.  In her essay “Imperial Plagiarism,” Marilyn Randall shows the interconnected relationship between the metaphors of conquest, colonialism and plagiarism, and examines the shifting rationales that underlay them. Randall refers to the “the colonial metaphor of legitimate possession through the civilizing work of improvement” (134). Randall’s “colonial metaphor” highlights how the historically Western sense of entitlement to conquest—built upon the notion that foreign lands and people can, and indeed must be, ‘improved’—has survived to this day. In the case of RiceTec’s basmati patent, it is this very same “colonial logic of possession by improvement, which itself is underwritten by the Lockean principals of production and work as sources of legitimate ownership,” that underpins and legitimizes RiceTec’s patent (Randall 134). This Lockean principal that X can be taken, improved upon, and thus newly owned is not only an entirely Eurocentric dynamic of ownership, but is the reasoning behind every European conquest into “savage lands” since Columbus pillaged the Bahamas on his way to America. When looked at through the Randall’s “colonial metaphor” we can understand the patenting of basmati to embody not only a cultural theft, and a conflict of ideologies of ownership, but indeed as a form of cultural colonialism.\r\n\r\nTerms like “colonialism” will often conjure a great deal of reaction and insinuation, so let us be clear: I am not calling RiceTec or international patent law inherently racist; what is at play here is one culture exercising its power and influence over another. Indeed, Vaidhyanathan argues that the battle lines drawn during intellectual property disputes are not etched along racial divides but are in fact a struggle between established and non-established entities (133).  In the case of the basmati patent the established entity is a Eurocentric system of ownership manifested as international patent law regulating and appropriating a foreign culture. When explaining his concept of “imperial plagiarism,” Lethem draws a similar picture saying that it is the appropriation of a “commonwealth culture for the benefit of a sole or corporate owner” where “cultural debts flow in, but they don’t flow out” (66). This analysis shows that the patenting of basmati is not only a commodification of culture for the economic benefit of established corporate interest, but is a cultural power grab. Randall says that if we “imagine a context where the “right to copy” construes no more economic benefits either on author or plagiarist,” what we will be left with is a “discourse of power” (Randall 131-132).  This is the most fundamental dynamic at work in the controversy surrounding the basmati patent. Intellectual property rights and copyright law are inherently a “discourse of power.”  So when the subject is the patenting of a cultural resource in the way that basmati rice is to the entire sub-continent of India, it becomes a discourse in cultural power, a discourse that the Western world has dominated for centuries.\r\n\r\nThis discourse of power not only assigns importance to one culture over another, but it is a modern day manifestation of European ideals and values imposing themselves on foreign peoples in foreign lands.  It is a clash of cultures and a revisiting of the “the colonial logic” that gave precedents to hundreds of years of both economic and cultural appropriation.\r\n\r\nWhile the cultural effects of such an appropriation are harder to measure than the economic indicators that follow them, they are none-the-less-real. When RiceTec patented a plant that both literally and figuratively constitutes the basis of a vast portion of Indian society and culture, they did more than just bite into India’s yearly export numbers. They stole from their cultural tradition. As stated before, basmati rice is a gift from generations of farmers to their children, and to their children’s children. Its unique aroma, taste, and texture was created and honed over millennia by Indians, and indeed for India.  To commodify, rebrand, and decontextualize a gift as sacred as this constitutes more than economic warfare, its cultural theft.\r\n\r\nBasmati rice, like so many cultural artifacts, is more than just a product for sale. It is simultaneously a reflection and an embodiment of a very specific culture and place in history.  It has inherent value and meaning beyond its market price.  The risk of depleting distinct cultural resources amidst the tides of globalization or in an attempt to make everything common is very real. Certain things belong to certain places, people, and cultures. Basmati rice is special because it is Indian.  Because it is grown in the foothills of the Himalayas. The use of another culture’s conception of property and ownership to remove it from that context is a direct threat to India’s cultural heritage. If Basmati became less Indian, then India itself would become less Indian.\r\n\r\nCultural appropriations like the basmati patent continue to this day.  As conscientious observers of this era of globalization we should not let economic rationales, or our own Westernized conceptions of property, explain away a new era of colonialism. The appropriation of traditional knowledge and resources of native peoples without consent or compensation is indeed colonialism, even if it is conducted under a more stylized banner. When we hear of corporations using patent law to reach into foreign cultures to appropriate the basis of a new product, we must remind ourselves that this is not just business-as-usual, or even simple corporate greed.  It is the ugly specter of colonial right and justification re-born in the 21st century.\r\n\r\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'test essay', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'test-essay-2', '', '', '2012-04-10 19:27:53', '2012-04-10 19:27:53', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=504', 0, 'essay', '', 0);

Forster’s essay, “What I Believe” addresses this pervasive mental struggle.  Forster’s ultimate humanist goal in the essay is to find a life philosophy independent from the dogma of religion, evidenced by his opening sentences, “I do not believe in Belief.  But this is an age of faith, and there are so many militant creeds that, in self-defense, one has to formulate a creed of one’s own” (67).  He suggests his era embraces the notion of religious faith too wholeheartedly, and he wants to develop a functional alternative.  To achieve this, Forster affirms that life should be lived to create, ultimately, “tolerance, good temper, and sympathy” (67). In his attempt to reach this philosophical ideal, he highlights the inevitability of turning to belief, even in his fiercely non-religious worldview. Forster’s essay raises, and may implicitly answer, the enduring question: <em>Can reason coexist with belief?</em>  In the essay, it becomes apparent that reason <em>can</em>, in fact, coexist with belief, provided that belief is founded upon and cooperative with empirical and philosophical derivations.  That is, provided it is not <em>blind</em> faith.\n\nFrom the outset of his essay, Forster criticizes religion and the tenets it seeks to uphold.  The very first sentence of the essay, “I do not believe in belief,” suggests that Forster withholds his commitment to anything requiring blind-faith acceptance of a rule (67).  He feels assaulted by the “militant creeds” of the Age of Faith, or religious reactionism, and writes in part to defend his humanistic principles against this threat (67).  One of the more pointed rejections of religious faith is expressed in his discussion of the principles of Christianity, “[The orthodox say] man has failed and always will fail to organize his own goodness, and it is presumptuous of him to try.  This claim—solemn as it is— leaves me cold.  I cannot believe that Christianity will ever cope with the present worldwide mess…” (75).  He is arguing that it is man’s <em>duty</em> to clarify for himself his own values. This argument for intellectual independence characterizes Forster’s stance on the issue of belief, leaving no doubt that he is opposed to religious faith.\n\nA consequence of Forster’s wholehearted rejection of blind faith, religion, and maybe even God, is that is seems he must develop his own philosophy based exclusively on reason.  But paradoxically peppered throughout the essay are passages that both triumphantly accept reason, and implicitly praise faith. This is not a logical pitfall of Forster’s essay but a manifestation of the subtle distinction between religious faith and humanistic faith that Forster seeks to establish.  Regarding personal relationships he claims, “For the purpose of living one has to assume that the personality is solid and the self is an entity, and to ignore all contrary evidence.  And since to ignore evidence is one of the characteristics of faith, I can certainly proclaim I believe in personal relationships” (68). Furthermore, he explains, “The people I respect most behave as if they were immortal and as if society was eternal” (71).  Both these quotes contain an explicit abandonment of reason and an acceptance of faith.  But even so, Forster carves a distinction between the religious belief he feels is reckless and the principled belief he feels is both constructive and unavoidable.  Subscribing to religious dogma does not satisfy Forster’s skeptical stance on faith, but holding to considered, principled beliefs like the ones above do.  Ultimately, he understands that reason and belief are hopelessly intertwined, and that there is a correct and constructive way to arrive at belief, and an incorrect, destructive way.  Given the historical context of the essay, this principle is particularly poignant.\n\nPublished in 1938, “What I Believe” was written in the throes of the political and social instability that led to World War II. A number of remarks within the essay point to Forster’s acute awareness of the unrest of the time.  He discusses a “gathering political storm,” mentions the merits of democracy allowing “public criticism” and avoiding “hushed up scandals,” mentions “labor camps” as a consequence of extreme governmental control, and notably ambiguously asserts “some people idealize force and pull it to the foreground and worship it” (68, 69, 70). Clearly, Forster was well aware of the brewing political issues of World War II and his essay is in part a reaction to the philosophical confusion and gravity of the coming war.  When viewed in this light, the dissonance between belief and reason takes on new meaning.  The war itself highlighted the fact that two logically derived diverging philosophies can exist and each side may still vehemently oppose the other. In the struggle of democracy vs. totalitarianism at which Forster hints heavily, both sides had justifications for their stances and, of course, their rhetoric for each would have been particularly pervasive in 1938.  The Axis powers asserted that totalitarianism provided order, cohesion, obedience, and efficiency and the Allied powers argued democracy promoted free speech, individual liberties, creativity, and social justice (Palmieri, Griggs).  Both sides had their intellectual stances, but both possessed something further: faith that their cause was correct. Just as Forster sought to define a humanistic philosophy that satisfied his ideals, the two sides developed their philosophies to satisfy their preconceived faith.  Forster captures this quiet parallel in his extensive discussion of democracy, and maybe most revealingly demonstrates his fears in the conclusion of his essay, “…one likes to say what one thinks while speech is comparatively free: it may not be free much longer” (76).  Clearly, Forster understands the war and its ideological struggle may come at a heavy cost.\n\nBut what is the importance of the philosophical dichotomy between the Allied and Axis powers and its phantom presence within the context of Forster’s essay?  It illustrates how belief is inexorably intertwined with reason.  That is, we use reason to accommodate belief and belief to accommodate reason.  Forster, in his essay, was using the irony of rejecting one belief and asserting another to capture the futility of arguing a point based largely, or entirely, on blind faith.  This parallels the political struggle of the time.  At the same time, he understands faith is inevitable and is wrestling with the implications of this reality.  Faced with war and the potential losses of lives and freedom, a satisfying solution to the issue of belief vs. reason seems particularly urgent.  Ultimately, he knows he cannot argue his worldview against another if it is buoyed by dogma, so he seeks to change faith’s “big ‘F’” to a little “f” by transforming the monolithic faith necessary for religion with one that coincides with our innate sense of common humanity.  He explains that the religious, those whose faith he does not support, “have faith with a large F.  My faith has a very small one, and I only intrude it because these are very strenuous days” (76).\n\nTo Forster, faith is inevitable; blind faith is not.  He illustrates that at some level we must accept certain central axioms on faith to live our intellectual lives at all (belief in personal relationships, the permanence of human civilization, democracy, an aristocracy of intelligentsia, etc.).  We do not and cannot know if these are true, but our choice of what and what not to have faith in is not necessarily blind.  It reflects our understanding of how the world is, and how we feel it should be, an empirically idealistic guess. Forster and those who subscribe to his distinction between beliefs, attempt to capture how the world appears, and further, how it <em>should</em> work.  Forster embraces relationships, aristocracy of intelligentsia, living life as if it had no end, and acting as if civilization was eternal not because he knows these things are true, but because these satisfy his understanding of how the world must exist for a philosophically, humanistically, and personally satisfying life.\n\nForster does not reject faith—only faith stemming from religion.  The chief difference between faith in religion and faith in principles, and the reason Forster makes this seemingly “splitting hairs” distinction, is that the former must necessarily be blind, while the latter is informed to the extent it reflects some ideal about the human condition reached through consideration, not dogmatic acceptance.  Belief and reason are not in fact mutually exclusive, but are both unavoidable and can even complement each other handsomely, provided that faith is not employed as a simplistic and convenient replacement for thought, but as a mechanism for developing informed principles.', 'The Necessity of Belief', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '502-autosave', '', '', '2012-04-10 19:23:01', '2012-04-10 19:23:01', '', 502, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?p=503', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

In 1997, the American corporation RiceTec patented Basmati rice, arguably appropriating a cultural staple into a generic brand. Through the lens of the patenting of Basmati rice, and by employing the work of Jonathan Lethem, Siva Vaidhyanathan, and Marilyn Randall, I will attempt to bring into focus the cultural context, conflict, and significance that is manifest in not only this controversy of appropriation, but within international patent law in general.

In other words, “the commons” in Vaidhyanathan’s conception is intended for use by those who have other, even more tangible things in common: culture, identity, and experiences.\n\nWhen RiceTec patented basmati rice in 1997, it did not remove the particular varieties native to India from “the commons” entirely (because it was a “new” hybridization of the rice, the various strains that existed previously in India were not affected). While this might appear to honor the concept of “the commons,” within Vaidhyanathan‘s conception it does quite the opposite. The issue at stake here is not simply a matter of whether or not Indian farmers can still grow and cultivate their cultural heritage; it is the fact that their cultural heritage was being appropriated and essentially exported by a foreign entity. This appropriation then becomes an attempt at cultural de-contextualization.  RiceTec’s patent might not have removed basmati from its place of origin, but by attempting to grow it in other places and contexts, it would have become just another globalized product, and not the rare cultural resource that it is today.\n\nThat is why it so disconcerting that when one examines the media coverage surrounding this controversy, it is difficult, if not impossible, to find the voice and opinion of the Indian basmati farmer.  (The coverage has allowed Indian intellectuals and cultural authorities like Vandana Shiva to speak out.) As much as one might like to provide a platform for the airing of their grievances and allow them to attest to the cultural significance of basmati, the news coverage of this controversy has focused almost solely on the economic and trade impact of the patent. The absence of the basmati farmers’ voices in the debate is yet another example of how basmati has been culturally de-contextualized. The importance of the very individuals who have cultivated basmati and stand to suffer the greatest from its appropriation have been ignored and ultimately lost amongst the discussion of trade figures and legal concerns.\n\nRiceTec, in attempting to making basmati a globalized good, was effectively devaluing the cultural uniqueness of basmati. Culture is a finite resource which must be protected. Ironically, there is a Western economic concept called the “tragedy of the commons” that states that a resource left in-common, or unowned, is fated to be abused and depleted by its inevitable overuse. There is no reason we should view the cultural commons from which basmati belongs to be any different. The appropriation of an essential cultural resource like basmati represents the opening salvo in a potentially dangerous trend. If a cultural resource is removed from its context and distributed endlessly throughout the world, the commons from which it came could suffer a tragedy of the cultural commons, depleting the source of its strength.\n\nIt is important to understand that this type of cultural de-contextualization and appropriation does not represent a new paradigm, but rather a historically recurring theme.  In her essay “Imperial Plagiarism,” Marilyn Randall shows the interconnected relationship between the metaphors of conquest, colonialism and plagiarism, and examines the shifting rationales that underlay them. Randall refers to the “the colonial metaphor of legitimate possession through the civilizing work of improvement” (134). Randall’s “colonial metaphor” highlights how the historically Western sense of entitlement to conquest—built upon the notion that foreign lands and people can, and indeed must be, ‘improved’—has survived to this day. In the case of RiceTec’s basmati patent, it is this very same “colonial logic of possession by improvement, which itself is underwritten by the Lockean principals of production and work as sources of legitimate ownership,” that underpins and legitimizes RiceTec’s patent (Randall 134). This Lockean principal that X can be taken, improved upon, and thus newly owned is not only an entirely Eurocentric dynamic of ownership, but is the reasoning behind every European conquest into “savage lands” since Columbus pillaged the Bahamas on his way to America. When looked at through the Randall’s “colonial metaphor” we can understand the patenting of basmati to embody not only a cultural theft, and a conflict of ideologies of ownership, but indeed as a form of cultural colonialism.\n\nTerms like “colonialism” will often conjure a great deal of reaction and insinuation, so let us be clear: I am not calling RiceTec or international patent law inherently racist; what is at play here is one culture exercising its power and influence over another. Indeed, Vaidhyanathan argues that the battle lines drawn during intellectual property disputes are not etched along racial divides but are in fact a struggle between established and non-established entities (133).  In the case of the basmati patent the established entity is a Eurocentric system of ownership manifested as international patent law regulating and appropriating a foreign culture. When explaining his concept of “imperial plagiarism,” Lethem draws a similar picture saying that it is the appropriation of a “commonwealth culture for the benefit of a sole or corporate owner” where “cultural debts flow in, but they don’t flow out” (66). This analysis shows that the patenting of basmati is not only a commodification of culture for the economic benefit of established corporate interest, but is a cultural power grab. Randall says that if we “imagine a context where the “right to copy” construes no more economic benefits either on author or plagiarist,” what we will be left with is a “discourse of power” (Randall 131-132).  This is the most fundamental dynamic at work in the controversy surrounding the basmati patent. Intellectual property rights and copyright law are inherently a “discourse of power.”  So when the subject is the patenting of a cultural resource in the way that basmati rice is to the entire sub-continent of India, it becomes a discourse in cultural power, a discourse that the Western world has dominated for centuries.\n\nThis discourse of power not only assigns importance to one culture over another, but it is a modern day manifestation of European ideals and values imposing themselves on foreign peoples in foreign lands.  It is a clash of cultures and a revisiting of the “the colonial logic” that gave precedents to hundreds of years of both economic and cultural appropriation.\n\nWhile the cultural effects of such an appropriation are harder to measure than the economic indicators that follow them, they are none-the-less-real. When RiceTec patented a plant that both literally and figuratively constitutes the basis of a vast portion of Indian society and culture, they did more than just bite into India’s yearly export numbers. They stole from their cultural tradition. As stated before, basmati rice is a gift from generations of farmers to their children, and to their children’s children. Its unique aroma, taste, and texture was created and honed over millennia by Indians, and indeed for India.  To commodify, rebrand, and decontextualize a gift as sacred as this constitutes more than economic warfare, its cultural theft.\n\nBasmati rice, like so many cultural artifacts, is more than just a product for sale. It is simultaneously a reflection and an embodiment of a very specific culture and place in history.  It has inherent value and meaning beyond its market price.  The risk of depleting distinct cultural resources amidst the tides of globalization or in an attempt to make everything common is very real. Certain things belong to certain places, people, and cultures. Basmati rice is special because it is Indian.  Because it is grown in the foothills of the Himalayas. The use of another culture’s conception of property and ownership to remove it from that context is a direct threat to India’s cultural heritage. If Basmati became less Indian, then India itself would become less Indian.\n\nCultural appropriations like the basmati patent continue to this day.  As conscientious observers of this era of globalization we should not let economic rationales, or our own Westernized conceptions of property, explain away a new era of colonialism. The appropriation of traditional knowledge and resources of native peoples without consent or compensation is indeed colonialism, even if it is conducted under a more stylized banner. When we hear of corporations using patent law to reach into foreign cultures to appropriate the basis of a new product, we must remind ourselves that this is not just business-as-usual, or even simple corporate greed.  It is the ugly specter of colonial right and justification re-born in the 21st century.\n\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;', 'test essay', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '504-autosave', '', '', '2012-04-10 19:27:57', '2012-04-10 19:27:57', '', 504, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?p=505', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

(18, 4, '2011-11-21 15:31:55', '2011-11-21 15:31:55', 'by Geoff Aung\r\n\r\nAs I emerged from the T station, the year’s first snowfall greeted my face. I was back in Harvard Square, where I had lived the preceding summer while interning at the Democratic National Convention. I was pleased to return, but I knew it was to a different place. Out of Town News, Harvard Yard, the Quad, Felipe’s Taqueria: none of them were the same—the landscape had changed. The musicians had left the streets to find a lonely coffeehouse mic. The LaRouche proselytizers had left to hibernate for another four years. The t-shirts and sandals of summer sun had retreated in the face of winter’s austere countenance. My political innocence was gone, as well. Two weeks ago, the election had fallen upon me with all the heavy weight of reality. Challenged by the outcome, I was a changed person looking at a changed landscape: over everything, an inch of fresh snow.\r\n\r\nI walked slowly to my friend’s dorm where I would be spending the weekend. Quiet lingered in the air. I could hear the soft crunch of New Balance on slush. It was as if the election had hastened the arrival of winter, as if the capitol of liberal politics was eager to retreat to the safety of the fireside. There, in oak-paneled studies with bookcases, thinking citizens would insulate themselves from the anti-intellectual New America, thumbing endlessly through back copies of the <em>New Yorker</em>, mourning past evocations of hope and possibility. I peered through the humble Puritan windowpanes along Dunster Street, convinced that those citizens were in each room. I watched my breath disappear in the falling snow, wondering where American borders really lie.\r\n\r\nByron E. Shafer opens his book <em>Bifurcated Politics</em> by admitting, “Even in an era when it is widely viewed as an institution in decline, the national party convention retains a certain immediate, raw, and visceral fascination” (1). I can sympathize. As a young politico working the convention, being in such a high-level political environment was exciting. I spoke to Jesse Jackson and James Carville on the phone. Terry McAuliffe (T-Mac to those in the know) was constantly in my midst. I shook hands with Barack Obama and Larry David, and I took a picture with George McGovern. Teresa Heinz Kerry signed my poster. I patiently awaited my CNN interview with cellphone in hand and credentials around my neck.\r\n\r\nWhat I was less apt to recognize was the “institution in decline” part of the experience. We the convention committee (in order to form a more perfect union), perched atop a skyscraper looking down on the Old State House, would hear about Mayor Menino’s problems with the police union. We would hear that Boston was going to lose—rather than gain, as was originally believed—significant sums of money on the convention. We would hear the complaints of Bostonians: too much traffic, altered public transportation, increased terrorist threat. We would hear, but we weren’t really listening. After all, they, the complainers, were on the outside. They couldn’t understand that it was all necessary. What did they know?\r\n\r\nIn her essay “Insider Baseball,” Joan Didion speaks to my experience. Writing about the Dukakis campaign of 1988, she considers the “assumption” of people within politics that “the narrative should be not just written only by its own specialists but also legible only to its own specialists” (50). Part of me thought that since I had an ID card that said DNC 2004 on it, I was more qualified to assess the convention. Those on the other side of the glass didn’t really know what they were talking about.\r\n\r\nDidion also details a scene in which Dukakis plays catch with one of his campaign aides on an airport tarmac. Didion writes:\r\n<blockquote>What we had in the tarmac arrival with ball tossing, then, was an understanding: a repeated moment witnessed by many people, all of whom believed it to be a setup and yet most of whom believed that only an outsider, only someone too ‘naïve’ to know the rules of the game, would so describe it. (65)</blockquote>\r\nDamned if I would be naïve. A friend of mine who had worked on the Dean campaign in New Hampshire (and was now in Vietnam on a fellowship) complained about the unnecessary level of control and choreography that he saw going into the convention. I told him it was all necessary: the lighting cues, the careful choice of music, the placement of the delegations on the floor, the speakers’ obligation to submit speeches beforehand for approval. “We can’t risk a disorganized appearance,” I insisted, “there is too much at stake.” What we needed, I believed (not uniquely, I might add), was to project an image of unified professionalism that would dispel, among other things, notions of a party torn by an extraordinarily divisive primary season. John Kerry was our man, and he would deliver us from George W. Bush’s dark presidency. Any calls for a more natural political forum misunderstood political strategy. Those who made those calls were, by definition, “outsiders.”\r\n\r\nThe narrative of insiderism that the convention unwittingly created proved to be destructive to its appeal. A bubble—dreaded in theory, embraced in practice—surrounded all things DNC. I remember on Thursday night, the last night of the whole spectacle, my friend Eric, who was interning for CNN, was able to get me into a party at the Roxy. Maroon 5 played the event. In the middle of the set, John Edwards—sleeves rolled up, tie loosened, mic in hand—appeared onstage in front of a dramatic green light as a fog machine did its thing. He looked heroic, almost godlike. He engaged the crowd: “This may look like a concert, this may feel like a concert, and this may sound like a concert.” The crowd quieted. We waited for his words. “But this is a movement.” We erupted. We were, of course, ready to cheer.\r\n\r\nEven this memory—one I recall so fondly—has paled since the election. Whereas I originally experienced it in terms of Shafer’s raw, visceral fascination, now I can’t help but see the shadow of decay about it, evidence of a declining institution. There I stood with two different credentials (one for the Fleet, one for the Roxy) in the plastic sleeve on my “Democrats Win It in the Field” lanyard, supposedly affirming some sort of “movement.” Was this the field? Was this where we were supposed to win it? After leaving one closed event, I was now at another closed event, both of which had further levels of exclusivity within them. Even worse, we—supposedly the party of the First Amendment—feared protests so much that we restricted peaceful demonstrations to an aptly named “Free Speech Zone” festooned with nets to “protect the delegates.” On the closing night of the convention, I stared as hundreds of police donned storm trooper riot gear and clogged the surrounding streets.\r\n\r\nWe assumed the movement Edwards referred to must have been some sort of popular uprising against the Republicans. But surely velvet ropes and nightsticks do not comprise a popular movement. In Boston, Massachusetts, the seat of leftist American politics, America’s foremost liberal party managed to hold a convention detested by the city’s citizens. Having always believed the Democrats to be a populist alternative to the stodgy GOP, I associated them with popular appeal. After all, Jules Witcover calls his history of the Democrats Party of the People. But the character of their convention—our convention, as it were—denied any such claim. In the end, far from anything I could have imagined earlier, exclusion may have been the name of the game. It certainly was at all of the satellite events: the Media Party in south Boston, the Rock the Vote party at the Avalon, the delegate parties throughout the week, the closing party at the Roxy. A prevailing insiderism dominated what was supposed to be our chance to show the country we were not a party of distant intellectual elites. It reminds me of my high school history teacher’s favorite phrase: “Lost opportunity.”\r\n\r\nThe parties, the symposiums, the caucuses, the book signings, the balloons, the music, the traffic, the t-shirts: all this, and for what? Conventions simply boost a general election season by approving a candidate already chosen. In reality, the DNC is little more than an extravagantly expensive gas station on the campaign trail. How expensive? The <em>Boston Globe</em> set the estimated cost of the convention at $95 million (Klein). Is it really justifiable to put that much money into such a weak institution, an institution whose own biographer considers it to be declining? If the convention were to serve a more pivotal purpose, such funding might be excusable; but to throw so much money at ratifying a foregone conclusion seems downright irresponsible.\r\n\r\nThe convention as an institution has not always been so weak. It was not always like today’s incarnation, essentially a well-dressed figurehead strutting around with a practiced air of self-importance. In fact, political conventions began in 1832 as a reaction against the same elite class that today’s conventions serve to propel. It was the nation’s first third party of note, the Anti-Masons, which introduced the concept of a national political convention. In <em>Party of the People</em>, Jules Witcover writes:\r\n<blockquote>(The Anti-Mason convention) was born of a case of the suspected murder of one William Morgan, of Batavia, New York, a former member of the secret Society of Freemasons who disappeared as he was about to publish an exposé of the society. Attempts to block its publication created demands for an investigation and ultimately a clamor against Masons in public office, culminating in a call for a convention to nominate a presidential candidate. (143)</blockquote>\r\nIronically, that convention nominated William Wirt, a rather uninteresting candidate who specifically stated his indifference to Masonry, to stand against Masons Andrew Jackson and Henry Clay (Witcover 143). However, much like today’s third parties, the Anti-Masons were less interested in a viable campaign than in national attention to their issues of import. As Shafer writes, “The quickest route to national stature was a presidential campaign, but the new party could hardly launch such a campaign with the dominant nominating device to that date, a caucus of party members in the U.S. Congress, because it possessed none” (9). From that point on, the national convention would replace the party caucus as the primary theater of presidential nomination. How strange it would be for the Anti-Masons to see the national convention, this child of theirs, existing today on the lifeblood of exclusivity and police security.\r\n\r\nIn terms of power, 1832 marked the beginning of a period that would last until 1952, at which point the convention began to look quite like the current ones. Within this period, the convention exhibited great power, deposing numerous sitting presidents, including John Tyler, Millard Fillmore, Franklin Pierce, and Chester Arthur. It also chose dark-horse candidates like James K. Polk (Shafer 15). Convention discourse centered mostly around the nominee in question, with some conventions featuring extended debate on whom to choose. But the decline of local political parties, as exemplified by New Deal legislation, had prepared the original convention character for its last hurrah in 1952. Shafer writes, “The Democratic convention of 1952 was the last of the classic old-style party gatherings and featured behavior which in its essence would have been familiar to convention participants a hundred years before” (33). He continues: “The product of this politicking, the candidate, had entered no primaries and engaged in no direct campaigning prior to his nomination” (33). Every convention thereafter demonstrated the shift of the nomination away from the convention itself and into the primary season, creating a movement towards today’s condition in which the convention serves only to approve a decision already made.\r\n\r\nThat shift accelerated in 1968 due to the tumultuous Democratic convention in Chicago, at which tens of thousands of protestors took their dissent to the streets. Their calls for bringing the political process nearer to the people ushered in an era of reform politics that saw the proliferation of the primary season, one perceived solution to the problem of high-level political bureaucracy. As a result, the convention evolved into the weakened form it holds to this day (Shafer 42). Stripped of its original nominating function, the convention began to look more like a risk than an opportunity. The two election cycles of the 1970’s demonstrated this idea. Shafer writes:\r\n<blockquote>In 1972, a Democratic convention featuring deep divisions between the nominee and his challengers and between the nominee and some of his own delegates was paired with a Republican convention featuring little evident conflict in either area. Yet only four years later, it was the Republican convention which manifested the major candidate conflict, along with exacerbating issue divisions, while the Democratic convention escaped candidate splits entirely and surfaced only minor issue conflicts to fuel its limited struggles. (150)</blockquote>\r\nIn both 1972 and 1976, the party that presented a more unified convention won the general election. This contrast between unity and disunity, unity triumphing each time, proved to be a lesson politicians would not soon forget. With the potential for a divisive primary season constantly threatening to produce an image of a party in conflict, conventions began to focus energy on polished appearance rather than honest debate. Disunity, an ominous sign of weakness, took on the characteristics of a risk to avoid at all costs.\r\n\r\nFor better or for worse, it seems the Democrats know their history. The 1970s conventions set a precedent—unity at all costs—that the national parties emulate to this day. One can imagine T-Mac and convention CEO Rod O’Connor sitting in a well-lit office late at night pondering the official convention slogan. America 2004: The Democratic Convention, or America 2004: A Stronger America? The differences are subtle, even aesthetic. But by July 26, the message had changed from the former to the latter. There could be nothing weak about this convention; history warns as much. “Strong” necessarily conjures images of unity, for strength is predicated on organized support. At the expense of a real political forum, we proceed with this historically fortified notion of strength, for we have learned the lessons of the ’70s. Certainly “unschooled” has never been an accusation leveled at Democrats. Nevertheless, the Golden Age of conventions is dead, and even the current age declines. Surely Swinburne waxed rhetorical when he asked, “Is not Precedent a king of men?”\r\n\r\nNow that the post-election pall had descended and winter had frozen over Harvard Square, I began to reevaluate my memories. After all, “we” had lost. This summer, good little Democrat that I was, I probably would have described the color of the convention as some sort of fluorescent blue. Now I might side with the dreaded gray. Neither red nor blue, Republican nor Democratic, just—gray. Perhaps my experience of disillusionment is simply a function of election depression. Or perhaps the election has been my apple, and I have eaten of it. Either way, I recall feeling like we had something—whether it was momentum, passion, or truth on our side, I’m not sure. But there was something that has faded now.\r\n\r\nThe November issue of <em>Harper’s</em>, which was released before the election, aptly demonstrates the Democrats’ obsession with presenting a united front. Ironically, it is Luke Mitchell’s essay about the Republican convention that accomplishes this, even as he lets the Democrats off the hook. He writes, “Whereas Kerry had struggled to create meaning—no matter how stupid, dishonest, or clichéd that meaning was—Bush’s team seemed actively to be plotting its demise” (67). Mitchell treats Kerry kindly, keenly aware of the approaching Tuesday. Mitchell continues, considering the discussion that took place in the Garden: “These were half-narratives, made up of questions so preposterous as to end discussion and possibly even subvert our understanding of what it means to mean something…The real message, radiating from the podium and echoing through the rafters, was that there was no message” (67). It is not difficult to imagine a covert Luke Mitchell marooned in The Red Sea, subconsciously holding his nose while straining his ears to catch the words between the echoes. The fact that he couldn’t decipher any message suggests that the Republicans know their historical precedents, too: Organization at the expense of meaning.\r\n\r\nBut now that the election is over and all may speak freely, one must wonder if Mitchell would still excuse Kerry. Perhaps not—I, for one, with hindsight shaded by the election, find his appraisal of the Republicans quite applicable to the Democrats. The Dems’ platform professes “a profound optimism about our future—an optimism that springs from our great faith in America” (Strong 1). In terms of gritty policy-talk that one might expect from a political platform, the document sounds more like a stump speech. It avoids confronting Iraq, turning that question instead into a section called “Strengthening Our Military.” It says, “We will add 40,000 new soldiers—not to increase the number of soldiers in Iraq, but to sustain our overseas deployments and prevent and prepare for other possible conflicts” (13). Worse, the title of the platform, the overall message, amounts to more of a non-message: “Strong at Home, Respected in the World.” Who can argue with such a stance? Is it a stance? The statement is eternally malleable: Anyone could mold it to his or her particular ideology. It is both isolationist and internationalist. It is both militant and gradualist. In essence, it is both liberal and conservative. It draws no lines, because it comes down on the side of no one. Even as the Dems tried to learn from history’s convenient lessons, they came up short. The Democratic message tried to be all things to all people—and still the electoral map bleeds endlessly. Perhaps we spoke directly to no one. Such is the risk of a politics of caution. In my own words, “There is too much at stake.”\r\n\r\nMitchell realizes that risk. In a later passage in his essay, he discusses the effort of the Republican convention to appear completely inoffensive, an effort I found similar to the Democrats’. He tries to recount the atmosphere of the Garden to a friend, who refers him to E.M. Forster’s <em>A Passage to India</em>. “It’s the Marabar Caves,” his friend tells him. Mitchell notes, “He was almost impossibly right.” Forster describes the caves:\r\n<blockquote>Whatever is said, the same monotonous noise replies, and quivers up and down the walls until it is absorbed into the roof. “Boum” is the sound as far as the human alphabet can express it, or “bou-oum,” or “ou-boum,” ­ utterly dull. Hope, politeness, the blowing of a nose, the squeak of a boot, all produce “boum”…. (68)</blockquote>\r\nIn a literal sense, the Marabar Caves recall to me the first night of the convention, when I was sitting very high up in the Fleet Center, straining my ears to hear the Clintons. The echoes were definitely overwhelming at times, and I missed much of what was said. But Mitchell cites Forster to get at something deeper. What Mitchell is concerned about is the conscious decision to sterilize discourse, to the extent that blowing one’s nose and expressions of hope both sound like “boum.” Both parties are guilty of this transgression; most likely the Republicans just play the game better. Forster realizes this, too. In the same passage, he writes, “Echoes generate echoes.” Today, echoes generate elections.\r\n\r\nAs I approached Kirkland House, my friend’s Harvard dorm, I took my earbuds out so I could concentrate on the directions he had given me. First gate on the right, proceed into the courtyard, turn left, look for the dining hall. No one had shoveled the walkway in the courtyard yet; I left footprints in the snow as I walked towards the door. Through the tall windows, I could see chandeliers and crowded tables. It looked warm inside.\r\n\r\nMonths before, we had visited this building, often late at night, so that my friend (who also interned with me) could show me where he would be living for the next three years of college. Another friend of his was spending the summer in the next house over, Eliot House, so we would go there, too, and we would have long political discussions in the night. We were like the “pink-cheeked young aides” Didion recalls in her essay, thinking of ourselves, “innocent of irony and therefore history, as ‘the best and the brightest’” (56). It rarely—if ever—occurred to me that the next time I would return, winter’s cold winds would have swooped down on the wings of the election to clear the landscape. There was an air of immortality about our convention work that summer. I assumed victory and the concomitant vindication would have taken place by now. From the heights of the Fleet Center, defeat looked impossible.\r\n\r\nIn <em>The Politics of National Party Conventions</em>, David, Goldman and Bain write: “Convention decisions cut close to the great political concerns of any society: the allocation of political power, the purposes for which political power shall be used, and the further evolution of the political system” (2). As a representative institution, as a symbol of a larger political process, the convention does not bode well for the future of politics. If the characteristics of this summer’s Democratic convention were to continue—the tendency towards insiderism, the construction of the “boum”—American politics would have some work to do before it could once again call itself a worthwhile organ of a government that pretends to democracy.\r\n\r\nEven now, in the wake of a disastrous election, the Democrats’ discussion of the future seems less interested in lasting change than more of the same. Take, for example, the theater in which a recent discussion took place. The New York Times reports that “Most of the party’s biggest names headed to former Clinton campaign adviser James Carville’s party at the old Arkansas Gazette Building, which served as the headquarters of Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign. Some partied at Doe’s Eat Place, an old Democratic hangout” (Democrats 1). That gathering sounds like a smaller version of this summer’s convention: elite figures discussing the nation’s future over cocktails. The words “old Democratic hangout” fall harshly upon my ears. But even the discourse itself comes up short. Governor Bill Richardson says, “I remember being on a trip with him in New Mexico: I put a cowboy hat on Senator Kerry and someone on his staff shuddered and asked me to stop. This is I think an example of the East Coast not connecting with the West Coast and with the rest of the country” (Nagourney 2). If Governor Richardson is right, this country is in a sad place: he believes it is more effective to pander to the “rest of the country” through empty props than actually to address issues they care about. Surely it’s less—not more—of Richardson’s theatrics that the political process needs.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I am simply unschooled in politics’ dark arts. Surely there are mysteries I cannot comprehend. After all, I am merely a has-been pink-cheeked young aide, stepping softly through the snow to meet up with my friend. If I was an insider before, by now I am a definite outsider. Apparently, you need not be one or the other to care. As for those thinking citizens, hibernating with stacks of the New Yorker, I found them in the Kirkland dining hall, discussing the Warren Court for a paper due in three days. Outside, on the trees and in the gardens, across the lawns and in the sky, the falling snow cleansed the canvas, painting over everything with a broad white stroke.

I was back in Harvard Square, where I had lived the preceding summer while interning at the Democratic National Convention. I was pleased to return, but I knew it was to a different place. Out of Town News, Harvard Yard, the Quad, Felipe’s Taqueria: none of them were the same—the landscape had changed. The musicians had left the streets to find a lonely coffeehouse mic. The LaRouche proselytizers had left to hibernate for another four years. The t-shirts and sandals of summer sun had retreated in the face of winter’s austere countenance. My political innocence was gone, as well. Two weeks ago, the election had fallen upon me with all the heavy weight of reality. Challenged by the outcome, I was a changed person looking at a changed landscape: over everything, an inch of fresh snow.\r\n\r\nI walked slowly to my friend’s dorm where I would be spending the weekend. Quiet lingered in the air. I could hear the soft crunch of New Balance on slush. It was as if the election had hastened the arrival of winter, as if the capitol of liberal politics was eager to retreat to the safety of the fireside. There, in oak-paneled studies with bookcases, thinking citizens would insulate themselves from the anti-intellectual New America, thumbing endlessly through back copies of the <em>New Yorker</em>, mourning past evocations of hope and possibility. I peered through the humble Puritan windowpanes along Dunster Street, convinced that those citizens were in each room. I watched my breath disappear in the falling snow, wondering where American borders really lie.\r\n\r\nByron E. Shafer opens his book <em>Bifurcated Politics</em> by admitting, “Even in an era when it is widely viewed as an institution in decline, the national party convention retains a certain immediate, raw, and visceral fascination” (1). I can sympathize. As a young politico working the convention, being in such a high-level political environment was exciting. I spoke to Jesse Jackson and James Carville on the phone. Terry McAuliffe (T-Mac to those in the know) was constantly in my midst. I shook hands with Barack Obama and Larry David, and I took a picture with George McGovern. Teresa Heinz Kerry signed my poster. I patiently awaited my CNN interview with cellphone in hand and credentials around my neck.\r\n\r\nWhat I was less apt to recognize was the “institution in decline” part of the experience. We the convention committee (in order to form a more perfect union), perched atop a skyscraper looking down on the Old State House, would hear about Mayor Menino’s problems with the police union. We would hear that Boston was going to lose—rather than gain, as was originally believed—significant sums of money on the convention. We would hear the complaints of Bostonians: too much traffic, altered public transportation, increased terrorist threat. We would hear, but we weren’t really listening. After all, they, the complainers, were on the outside. They couldn’t understand that it was all necessary. What did they know?\r\n\r\nIn her essay “Insider Baseball,” Joan Didion speaks to my experience. Writing about the Dukakis campaign of 1988, she considers the “assumption” of people within politics that “the narrative should be not just written only by its own specialists but also legible only to its own specialists” (50). Part of me thought that since I had an ID card that said DNC 2004 on it, I was more qualified to assess the convention. Those on the other side of the glass didn’t really know what they were talking about.\r\n\r\nDidion also details a scene in which Dukakis plays catch with one of his campaign aides on an airport tarmac. Didion writes:\r\n<blockquote>What we had in the tarmac arrival with ball tossing, then, was an understanding: a repeated moment witnessed by many people, all of whom believed it to be a setup and yet most of whom believed that only an outsider, only someone too ‘naïve’ to know the rules of the game, would so describe it. (65)</blockquote>\r\nDamned if I would be naïve. A friend of mine who had worked on the Dean campaign in New Hampshire (and was now in Vietnam on a fellowship) complained about the unnecessary level of control and choreography that he saw going into the convention. I told him it was all necessary: the lighting cues, the careful choice of music, the placement of the delegations on the floor, the speakers’ obligation to submit speeches beforehand for approval. “We can’t risk a disorganized appearance,” I insisted, “there is too much at stake.” What we needed, I believed (not uniquely, I might add), was to project an image of unified professionalism that would dispel, among other things, notions of a party torn by an extraordinarily divisive primary season. John Kerry was our man, and he would deliver us from George W. Bush’s dark presidency. Any calls for a more natural political forum misunderstood political strategy. Those who made those calls were, by definition, “outsiders.”\r\n\r\nThe narrative of insiderism that the convention unwittingly created proved to be destructive to its appeal. A bubble—dreaded in theory, embraced in practice—surrounded all things DNC. I remember on Thursday night, the last night of the whole spectacle, my friend Eric, who was interning for CNN, was able to get me into a party at the Roxy. Maroon 5 played the event. In the middle of the set, John Edwards—sleeves rolled up, tie loosened, mic in hand—appeared onstage in front of a dramatic green light as a fog machine did its thing. He looked heroic, almost godlike. He engaged the crowd: “This may look like a concert, this may feel like a concert, and this may sound like a concert.” The crowd quieted. We waited for his words. “But this is a movement.” We erupted. We were, of course, ready to cheer.\r\n\r\nEven this memory—one I recall so fondly—has paled since the election. Whereas I originally experienced it in terms of Shafer’s raw, visceral fascination, now I can’t help but see the shadow of decay about it, evidence of a declining institution. There I stood with two different credentials (one for the Fleet, one for the Roxy) in the plastic sleeve on my “Democrats Win It in the Field” lanyard, supposedly affirming some sort of “movement.” Was this the field? Was this where we were supposed to win it? After leaving one closed event, I was now at another closed event, both of which had further levels of exclusivity within them. Even worse, we—supposedly the party of the First Amendment—feared protests so much that we restricted peaceful demonstrations to an aptly named “Free Speech Zone” festooned with nets to “protect the delegates.” On the closing night of the convention, I stared as hundreds of police donned storm trooper riot gear and clogged the surrounding streets.\r\n\r\nWe assumed the movement Edwards referred to must have been some sort of popular uprising against the Republicans. But surely velvet ropes and nightsticks do not comprise a popular movement. In Boston, Massachusetts, the seat of leftist American politics, America’s foremost liberal party managed to hold a convention detested by the city’s citizens. Having always believed the Democrats to be a populist alternative to the stodgy GOP, I associated them with popular appeal. After all, Jules Witcover calls his history of the Democrats Party of the People. But the character of their convention—our convention, as it were—denied any such claim. In the end, far from anything I could have imagined earlier, exclusion may have been the name of the game. It certainly was at all of the satellite events: the Media Party in south Boston, the Rock the Vote party at the Avalon, the delegate parties throughout the week, the closing party at the Roxy. A prevailing insiderism dominated what was supposed to be our chance to show the country we were not a party of distant intellectual elites. It reminds me of my high school history teacher’s favorite phrase: “Lost opportunity.”\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe parties, the symposiums, the caucuses, the book signings, the balloons, the music, the traffic, the t-shirts: all this, and for what? Conventions simply boost a general election season by approving a candidate already chosen. In reality, the DNC is little more than an extravagantly expensive gas station on the campaign trail. How expensive? The <em>Boston Globe</em> set the estimated cost of the convention at $95 million (Klein). Is it really justifiable to put that much money into such a weak institution, an institution whose own biographer considers it to be declining? If the convention were to serve a more pivotal purpose, such funding might be excusable; but to throw so much money at ratifying a foregone conclusion seems downright irresponsible.\r\n\r\nThe convention as an institution has not always been so weak. It was not always like today’s incarnation, essentially a well-dressed figurehead strutting around with a practiced air of self-importance. In fact, political conventions began in 1832 as a reaction against the same elite class that today’s conventions serve to propel. It was the nation’s first third party of note, the Anti-Masons, which introduced the concept of a national political convention. In <em>Party of the People</em>, Jules Witcover writes:\r\n<blockquote>(The Anti-Mason convention) was born of a case of the suspected murder of one William Morgan, of Batavia, New York, a former member of the secret Society of Freemasons who disappeared as he was about to publish an exposé of the society. Attempts to block its publication created demands for an investigation and ultimately a clamor against Masons in public office, culminating in a call for a convention to nominate a presidential candidate. (143)</blockquote>\r\nIronically, that convention nominated William Wirt, a rather uninteresting candidate who specifically stated his indifference to Masonry, to stand against Masons Andrew Jackson and Henry Clay (Witcover 143). However, much like today’s third parties, the Anti-Masons were less interested in a viable campaign than in national attention to their issues of import. As Shafer writes, “The quickest route to national stature was a presidential campaign, but the new party could hardly launch such a campaign with the dominant nominating device to that date, a caucus of party members in the U.S. Congress, because it possessed none” (9). From that point on, the national convention would replace the party caucus as the primary theater of presidential nomination. How strange it would be for the Anti-Masons to see the national convention, this child of theirs, existing today on the lifeblood of exclusivity and police security.\r\n\r\nIn terms of power, 1832 marked the beginning of a period that would last until 1952, at which point the convention began to look quite like the current ones. Within this period, the convention exhibited great power, deposing numerous sitting presidents, including John Tyler, Millard Fillmore, Franklin Pierce, and Chester Arthur. It also chose dark-horse candidates like James K. Polk (Shafer 15). Convention discourse centered mostly around the nominee in question, with some conventions featuring extended debate on whom to choose. But the decline of local political parties, as exemplified by New Deal legislation, had prepared the original convention character for its last hurrah in 1952. Shafer writes, “The Democratic convention of 1952 was the last of the classic old-style party gatherings and featured behavior which in its essence would have been familiar to convention participants a hundred years before” (33). He continues: “The product of this politicking, the candidate, had entered no primaries and engaged in no direct campaigning prior to his nomination” (33). Every convention thereafter demonstrated the shift of the nomination away from the convention itself and into the primary season, creating a movement towards today’s condition in which the convention serves only to approve a decision already made.\r\n\r\nThat shift accelerated in 1968 due to the tumultuous Democratic convention in Chicago, at which tens of thousands of protestors took their dissent to the streets. Their calls for bringing the political process nearer to the people ushered in an era of reform politics that saw the proliferation of the primary season, one perceived solution to the problem of high-level political bureaucracy. As a result, the convention evolved into the weakened form it holds to this day (Shafer 42). Stripped of its original nominating function, the convention began to look more like a risk than an opportunity. The two election cycles of the 1970’s demonstrated this idea. Shafer writes:\r\n<blockquote>In 1972, a Democratic convention featuring deep divisions between the nominee and his challengers and between the nominee and some of his own delegates was paired with a Republican convention featuring little evident conflict in either area. Yet only four years later, it was the Republican convention which manifested the major candidate conflict, along with exacerbating issue divisions, while the Democratic convention escaped candidate splits entirely and surfaced only minor issue conflicts to fuel its limited struggles. (150)</blockquote>\r\nIn both 1972 and 1976, the party that presented a more unified convention won the general election. This contrast between unity and disunity, unity triumphing each time, proved to be a lesson politicians would not soon forget. With the potential for a divisive primary season constantly threatening to produce an image of a party in conflict, conventions began to focus energy on polished appearance rather than honest debate. Disunity, an ominous sign of weakness, took on the characteristics of a risk to avoid at all costs.\r\n\r\nFor better or for worse, it seems the Democrats know their history. The 1970s conventions set a precedent—unity at all costs—that the national parties emulate to this day. One can imagine T-Mac and convention CEO Rod O’Connor sitting in a well-lit office late at night pondering the official convention slogan. America 2004: The Democratic Convention, or America 2004: A Stronger America? The differences are subtle, even aesthetic. But by July 26, the message had changed from the former to the latter. There could be nothing weak about this convention; history warns as much. “Strong” necessarily conjures images of unity, for strength is predicated on organized support. At the expense of a real political forum, we proceed with this historically fortified notion of strength, for we have learned the lessons of the ’70s. Certainly “unschooled” has never been an accusation leveled at Democrats. Nevertheless, the Golden Age of conventions is dead, and even the current age declines. Surely Swinburne waxed rhetorical when he asked, “Is not Precedent a king of men?”\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNow that the post-election pall had descended and winter had frozen over Harvard Square, I began to reevaluate my memories. After all, “we” had lost. This summer, good little Democrat that I was, I probably would have described the color of the convention as some sort of fluorescent blue. Now I might side with the dreaded gray. Neither red nor blue, Republican nor Democratic, just—gray. Perhaps my experience of disillusionment is simply a function of election depression. Or perhaps the election has been my apple, and I have eaten of it. Either way, I recall feeling like we had something—whether it was momentum, passion, or truth on our side, I’m not sure. But there was something that has faded now.\r\n\r\nThe November issue of <em>Harper’s</em>, which was released before the election, aptly demonstrates the Democrats’ obsession with presenting a united front. Ironically, it is Luke Mitchell’s essay about the Republican convention that accomplishes this, even as he lets the Democrats off the hook. He writes, “Whereas Kerry had struggled to create meaning—no matter how stupid, dishonest, or clichéd that meaning was—Bush’s team seemed actively to be plotting its demise” (67). Mitchell treats Kerry kindly, keenly aware of the approaching Tuesday. Mitchell continues, considering the discussion that took place in the Garden: “These were half-narratives, made up of questions so preposterous as to end discussion and possibly even subvert our understanding of what it means to mean something…The real message, radiating from the podium and echoing through the rafters, was that there was no message” (67). It is not difficult to imagine a covert Luke Mitchell marooned in The Red Sea, subconsciously holding his nose while straining his ears to catch the words between the echoes. The fact that he couldn’t decipher any message suggests that the Republicans know their historical precedents, too: Organization at the expense of meaning.\r\n\r\nBut now that the election is over and all may speak freely, one must wonder if Mitchell would still excuse Kerry. Perhaps not—I, for one, with hindsight shaded by the election, find his appraisal of the Republicans quite applicable to the Democrats. The Dems’ platform professes “a profound optimism about our future—an optimism that springs from our great faith in America” (Strong 1). In terms of gritty policy-talk that one might expect from a political platform, the document sounds more like a stump speech. It avoids confronting Iraq, turning that question instead into a section called “Strengthening Our Military.” It says, “We will add 40,000 new soldiers—not to increase the number of soldiers in Iraq, but to sustain our overseas deployments and prevent and prepare for other possible conflicts” (13). Worse, the title of the platform, the overall message, amounts to more of a non-message: “Strong at Home, Respected in the World.” Who can argue with such a stance? Is it a stance? The statement is eternally malleable: Anyone could mold it to his or her particular ideology. It is both isolationist and internationalist. It is both militant and gradualist. In essence, it is both liberal and conservative. It draws no lines, because it comes down on the side of no one. Even as the Dems tried to learn from history’s convenient lessons, they came up short. The Democratic message tried to be all things to all people—and still the electoral map bleeds endlessly. Perhaps we spoke directly to no one. Such is the risk of a politics of caution. In my own words, “There is too much at stake.”\r\n\r\nMitchell realizes that risk. In a later passage in his essay, he discusses the effort of the Republican convention to appear completely inoffensive, an effort I found similar to the Democrats’. He tries to recount the atmosphere of the Garden to a friend, who refers him to E.M. Forster’s <em>A Passage to India</em>. “It’s the Marabar Caves,” his friend tells him. Mitchell notes, “He was almost impossibly right.” Forster describes the caves:\r\n<blockquote>Whatever is said, the same monotonous noise replies, and quivers up and down the walls until it is absorbed into the roof. “Boum” is the sound as far as the human alphabet can express it, or “bou-oum,” or “ou-boum,” ­ utterly dull. Hope, politeness, the blowing of a nose, the squeak of a boot, all produce “boum”…. (68)</blockquote>\r\nIn a literal sense, the Marabar Caves recall to me the first night of the convention, when I was sitting very high up in the Fleet Center, straining my ears to hear the Clintons. The echoes were definitely overwhelming at times, and I missed much of what was said. But Mitchell cites Forster to get at something deeper. What Mitchell is concerned about is the conscious decision to sterilize discourse, to the extent that blowing one’s nose and expressions of hope both sound like “boum.” Both parties are guilty of this transgression; most likely the Republicans just play the game better. Forster realizes this, too. In the same passage, he writes, “Echoes generate echoes.” Today, echoes generate elections.\r\n\r\nAs I approached Kirkland House, my friend’s Harvard dorm, I took my earbuds out so I could concentrate on the directions he had given me. First gate on the right, proceed into the courtyard, turn left, look for the dining hall. No one had shoveled the walkway in the courtyard yet; I left footprints in the snow as I walked towards the door. Through the tall windows, I could see chandeliers and crowded tables. It looked warm inside.\r\n\r\nMonths before, we had visited this building, often late at night, so that my friend (who also interned with me) could show me where he would be living for the next three years of college. Another friend of his was spending the summer in the next house over, Eliot House, so we would go there, too, and we would have long political discussions in the night. We were like the “pink-cheeked young aides” Didion recalls in her essay, thinking of ourselves, “innocent of irony and therefore history, as ‘the best and the brightest’” (56). It rarely—if ever—occurred to me that the next time I would return, winter’s cold winds would have swooped down on the wings of the election to clear the landscape. There was an air of immortality about our convention work that summer. I assumed victory and the concomitant vindication would have taken place by now. From the heights of the Fleet Center, defeat looked impossible.\r\n\r\nIn <em>The Politics of National Party Conventions</em>, David, Goldman and Bain write: “Convention decisions cut close to the great political concerns of any society: the allocation of political power, the purposes for which political power shall be used, and the further evolution of the political system” (2). As a representative institution, as a symbol of a larger political process, the convention does not bode well for the future of politics. If the characteristics of this summer’s Democratic convention were to continue—the tendency towards insiderism, the construction of the “boum”—American politics would have some work to do before it could once again call itself a worthwhile organ of a government that pretends to democracy.\r\n\r\nEven now, in the wake of a disastrous election, the Democrats’ discussion of the future seems less interested in lasting change than more of the same. Take, for example, the theater in which a recent discussion took place. The New York Times reports that “Most of the party’s biggest names headed to former Clinton campaign adviser James Carville’s party at the old Arkansas Gazette Building, which served as the headquarters of Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign. Some partied at Doe’s Eat Place, an old Democratic hangout” (Democrats 1). That gathering sounds like a smaller version of this summer’s convention: elite figures discussing the nation’s future over cocktails. The words “old Democratic hangout” fall harshly upon my ears. But even the discourse itself comes up short. Governor Bill Richardson says, “I remember being on a trip with him in New Mexico: I put a cowboy hat on Senator Kerry and someone on his staff shuddered and asked me to stop. This is I think an example of the East Coast not connecting with the West Coast and with the rest of the country” (Nagourney 2). If Governor Richardson is right, this country is in a sad place: he believes it is more effective to pander to the “rest of the country” through empty props than actually to address issues they care about. Surely it’s less—not more—of Richardson’s theatrics that the political process needs.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I am simply unschooled in politics’ dark arts. Surely there are mysteries I cannot comprehend. After all, I am merely a has-been pink-cheeked young aide, stepping softly through the snow to meet up with my friend. If I was an insider before, by now I am a definite outsider. Apparently, you need not be one or the other to care. As for those thinking citizens, hibernating with stacks of the New Yorker, I found them in the Kirkland dining hall, discussing the Warren Court for a paper due in three days. Outside, on the trees and in the gardens, across the lawns and in the sky, the falling snow cleansed the canvas, painting over everything with a broad white stroke. Preparation for rebirth had already begun, for the winter always precedes the spring.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWorks Cited\r\n\r\nDavid, Paul T., Ralph M.

I remember on Thursday night, the last night of the whole spectacle, my friend Eric, who was interning for CNN, was able to get me into a party at the Roxy. Maroon 5 played the event. In the middle of the set, John Edwards—sleeves rolled up, tie loosened, mic in hand—appeared onstage in front of a dramatic green light as a fog machine did its thing. He looked heroic, almost godlike. He engaged the crowd: “This may look like a concert, this may feel like a concert, and this may sound like a concert.” The crowd quieted. We waited for his words. “But this is a movement.” We erupted. We were, of course, ready to cheer.\r\n\r\nEven this memory—one I recall so fondly—has paled since the election. Whereas I originally experienced it in terms of Shafer’s raw, visceral fascination, now I can’t help but see the shadow of decay about it, evidence of a declining institution. There I stood with two different credentials (one for the Fleet, one for the Roxy) in the plastic sleeve on my “Democrats Win It in the Field” lanyard, supposedly affirming some sort of “movement.” Was this the field? Was this where we were supposed to win it? After leaving one closed event, I was now at another closed event, both of which had further levels of exclusivity within them. Even worse, we—supposedly the party of the First Amendment—feared protests so much that we restricted peaceful demonstrations to an aptly named “Free Speech Zone” festooned with nets to “protect the delegates.” On the closing night of the convention, I stared as hundreds of police donned storm trooper riot gear and clogged the surrounding streets.\r\n\r\nWe assumed the movement Edwards referred to must have been some sort of popular uprising against the Republicans. But surely velvet ropes and nightsticks do not comprise a popular movement. In Boston, Massachusetts, the seat of leftist American politics, America’s foremost liberal party managed to hold a convention detested by the city’s citizens. Having always believed the Democrats to be a populist alternative to the stodgy GOP, I associated them with popular appeal. After all, Jules Witcover calls his history of the Democrats Party of the People. But the character of their convention—our convention, as it were—denied any such claim. In the end, far from anything I could have imagined earlier, exclusion may have been the name of the game. It certainly was at all of the satellite events: the Media Party in south Boston, the Rock the Vote party at the Avalon, the delegate parties throughout the week, the closing party at the Roxy. A prevailing insiderism dominated what was supposed to be our chance to show the country we were not a party of distant intellectual elites. It reminds me of my high school history teacher’s favorite phrase: “Lost opportunity.”\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe parties, the symposiums, the caucuses, the book signings, the balloons, the music, the traffic, the t-shirts: all this, and for what? Conventions simply boost a general election season by approving a candidate already chosen. In reality, the DNC is little more than an extravagantly expensive gas station on the campaign trail. How expensive? The <em>Boston Globe</em> set the estimated cost of the convention at $95 million (Klein). Is it really justifiable to put that much money into such a weak institution, an institution whose own biographer considers it to be declining? If the convention were to serve a more pivotal purpose, such funding might be excusable; but to throw so much money at ratifying a foregone conclusion seems downright irresponsible.\r\n\r\nThe convention as an institution has not always been so weak. It was not always like today’s incarnation, essentially a well-dressed figurehead strutting around with a practiced air of self-importance. In fact, political conventions began in 1832 as a reaction against the same elite class that today’s conventions serve to propel. It was the nation’s first third party of note, the Anti-Masons, which introduced the concept of a national political convention. In <em>Party of the People</em>, Jules Witcover writes:\r\n<blockquote>(The Anti-Mason convention) was born of a case of the suspected murder of one William Morgan, of Batavia, New York, a former member of the secret Society of Freemasons who disappeared as he was about to publish an exposé of the society. Attempts to block its publication created demands for an investigation and ultimately a clamor against Masons in public office, culminating in a call for a convention to nominate a presidential candidate. (143)</blockquote>\r\nIronically, that convention nominated William Wirt, a rather uninteresting candidate who specifically stated his indifference to Masonry, to stand against Masons Andrew Jackson and Henry Clay (Witcover 143). However, much like today’s third parties, the Anti-Masons were less interested in a viable campaign than in national attention to their issues of import. As Shafer writes, “The quickest route to national stature was a presidential campaign, but the new party could hardly launch such a campaign with the dominant nominating device to that date, a caucus of party members in the U.S. Congress, because it possessed none” (9). From that point on, the national convention would replace the party caucus as the primary theater of presidential nomination. How strange it would be for the Anti-Masons to see the national convention, this child of theirs, existing today on the lifeblood of exclusivity and police security.\r\n\r\nIn terms of power, 1832 marked the beginning of a period that would last until 1952, at which point the convention began to look quite like the current ones. Within this period, the convention exhibited great power, deposing numerous sitting presidents, including John Tyler, Millard Fillmore, Franklin Pierce, and Chester Arthur. It also chose dark-horse candidates like James K. Polk (Shafer 15). Convention discourse centered mostly around the nominee in question, with some conventions featuring extended debate on whom to choose. But the decline of local political parties, as exemplified by New Deal legislation, had prepared the original convention character for its last hurrah in 1952. Shafer writes, “The Democratic convention of 1952 was the last of the classic old-style party gatherings and featured behavior which in its essence would have been familiar to convention participants a hundred years before” (33). He continues: “The product of this politicking, the candidate, had entered no primaries and engaged in no direct campaigning prior to his nomination” (33). Every convention thereafter demonstrated the shift of the nomination away from the convention itself and into the primary season, creating a movement towards today’s condition in which the convention serves only to approve a decision already made.\r\n\r\nThat shift accelerated in 1968 due to the tumultuous Democratic convention in Chicago, at which tens of thousands of protestors took their dissent to the streets. Their calls for bringing the political process nearer to the people ushered in an era of reform politics that saw the proliferation of the primary season, one perceived solution to the problem of high-level political bureaucracy. As a result, the convention evolved into the weakened form it holds to this day (Shafer 42). Stripped of its original nominating function, the convention began to look more like a risk than an opportunity. The two election cycles of the 1970’s demonstrated this idea. Shafer writes:\r\n<blockquote>In 1972, a Democratic convention featuring deep divisions between the nominee and his challengers and between the nominee and some of his own delegates was paired with a Republican convention featuring little evident conflict in either area. Yet only four years later, it was the Republican convention which manifested the major candidate conflict, along with exacerbating issue divisions, while the Democratic convention escaped candidate splits entirely and surfaced only minor issue conflicts to fuel its limited struggles. (150)</blockquote>\r\nIn both 1972 and 1976, the party that presented a more unified convention won the general election. This contrast between unity and disunity, unity triumphing each time, proved to be a lesson politicians would not soon forget. With the potential for a divisive primary season constantly threatening to produce an image of a party in conflict, conventions began to focus energy on polished appearance rather than honest debate. Disunity, an ominous sign of weakness, took on the characteristics of a risk to avoid at all costs.\r\n\r\nFor better or for worse, it seems the Democrats know their history. The 1970s conventions set a precedent—unity at all costs—that the national parties emulate to this day. One can imagine T-Mac and convention CEO Rod O’Connor sitting in a well-lit office late at night pondering the official convention slogan. America 2004: The Democratic Convention, or America 2004: A Stronger America? The differences are subtle, even aesthetic. But by July 26, the message had changed from the former to the latter. There could be nothing weak about this convention; history warns as much. “Strong” necessarily conjures images of unity, for strength is predicated on organized support. At the expense of a real political forum, we proceed with this historically fortified notion of strength, for we have learned the lessons of the ’70s. Certainly “unschooled” has never been an accusation leveled at Democrats. Nevertheless, the Golden Age of conventions is dead, and even the current age declines. Surely Swinburne waxed rhetorical when he asked, “Is not Precedent a king of men?”\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNow that the post-election pall had descended and winter had frozen over Harvard Square, I began to reevaluate my memories. After all, “we” had lost. This summer, good little Democrat that I was, I probably would have described the color of the convention as some sort of fluorescent blue. Now I might side with the dreaded gray. Neither red nor blue, Republican nor Democratic, just—gray. Perhaps my experience of disillusionment is simply a function of election depression. Or perhaps the election has been my apple, and I have eaten of it. Either way, I recall feeling like we had something—whether it was momentum, passion, or truth on our side, I’m not sure. But there was something that has faded now.\r\n\r\nThe November issue of <em>Harper’s</em>, which was released before the election, aptly demonstrates the Democrats’ obsession with presenting a united front. Ironically, it is Luke Mitchell’s essay about the Republican convention that accomplishes this, even as he lets the Democrats off the hook. He writes, “Whereas Kerry had struggled to create meaning—no matter how stupid, dishonest, or clichéd that meaning was—Bush’s team seemed actively to be plotting its demise” (67). Mitchell treats Kerry kindly, keenly aware of the approaching Tuesday. Mitchell continues, considering the discussion that took place in the Garden: “These were half-narratives, made up of questions so preposterous as to end discussion and possibly even subvert our understanding of what it means to mean something…The real message, radiating from the podium and echoing through the rafters, was that there was no message” (67). It is not difficult to imagine a covert Luke Mitchell marooned in The Red Sea, subconsciously holding his nose while straining his ears to catch the words between the echoes. The fact that he couldn’t decipher any message suggests that the Republicans know their historical precedents, too: Organization at the expense of meaning.\r\n\r\nBut now that the election is over and all may speak freely, one must wonder if Mitchell would still excuse Kerry. Perhaps not—I, for one, with hindsight shaded by the election, find his appraisal of the Republicans quite applicable to the Democrats. The Dems’ platform professes “a profound optimism about our future—an optimism that springs from our great faith in America” (Strong 1). In terms of gritty policy-talk that one might expect from a political platform, the document sounds more like a stump speech. It avoids confronting Iraq, turning that question instead into a section called “Strengthening Our Military.” It says, “We will add 40,000 new soldiers—not to increase the number of soldiers in Iraq, but to sustain our overseas deployments and prevent and prepare for other possible conflicts” (13). Worse, the title of the platform, the overall message, amounts to more of a non-message: “Strong at Home, Respected in the World.” Who can argue with such a stance? Is it a stance? The statement is eternally malleable: Anyone could mold it to his or her particular ideology. It is both isolationist and internationalist. It is both militant and gradualist. In essence, it is both liberal and conservative. It draws no lines, because it comes down on the side of no one. Even as the Dems tried to learn from history’s convenient lessons, they came up short. The Democratic message tried to be all things to all people—and still the electoral map bleeds endlessly. Perhaps we spoke directly to no one. Such is the risk of a politics of caution. In my own words, “There is too much at stake.”\r\n\r\nMitchell realizes that risk. In a later passage in his essay, he discusses the effort of the Republican convention to appear completely inoffensive, an effort I found similar to the Democrats’. He tries to recount the atmosphere of the Garden to a friend, who refers him to E.M. Forster’s <em>A Passage to India</em>. “It’s the Marabar Caves,” his friend tells him. Mitchell notes, “He was almost impossibly right.” Forster describes the caves:\r\n<blockquote>Whatever is said, the same monotonous noise replies, and quivers up and down the walls until it is absorbed into the roof. “Boum” is the sound as far as the human alphabet can express it, or “bou-oum,” or “ou-boum,” ­ utterly dull. Hope, politeness, the blowing of a nose, the squeak of a boot, all produce “boum”…. (68)</blockquote>\r\nIn a literal sense, the Marabar Caves recall to me the first night of the convention, when I was sitting very high up in the Fleet Center, straining my ears to hear the Clintons. The echoes were definitely overwhelming at times, and I missed much of what was said. But Mitchell cites Forster to get at something deeper. What Mitchell is concerned about is the conscious decision to sterilize discourse, to the extent that blowing one’s nose and expressions of hope both sound like “boum.” Both parties are guilty of this transgression; most likely the Republicans just play the game better. Forster realizes this, too. In the same passage, he writes, “Echoes generate echoes.” Today, echoes generate elections.\r\n\r\nAs I approached Kirkland House, my friend’s Harvard dorm, I took my earbuds out so I could concentrate on the directions he had given me. First gate on the right, proceed into the courtyard, turn left, look for the dining hall. No one had shoveled the walkway in the courtyard yet; I left footprints in the snow as I walked towards the door. Through the tall windows, I could see chandeliers and crowded tables. It looked warm inside.\r\n\r\nMonths before, we had visited this building, often late at night, so that my friend (who also interned with me) could show me where he would be living for the next three years of college. Another friend of his was spending the summer in the next house over, Eliot House, so we would go there, too, and we would have long political discussions in the night. We were like the “pink-cheeked young aides” Didion recalls in her essay, thinking of ourselves, “innocent of irony and therefore history, as ‘the best and the brightest’” (56). It rarely—if ever—occurred to me that the next time I would return, winter’s cold winds would have swooped down on the wings of the election to clear the landscape. There was an air of immortality about our convention work that summer. I assumed victory and the concomitant vindication would have taken place by now. From the heights of the Fleet Center, defeat looked impossible.\r\n\r\nIn <em>The Politics of National Party Conventions</em>, David, Goldman and Bain write: “Convention decisions cut close to the great political concerns of any society: the allocation of political power, the purposes for which political power shall be used, and the further evolution of the political system” (2). As a representative institution, as a symbol of a larger political process, the convention does not bode well for the future of politics. If the characteristics of this summer’s Democratic convention were to continue—the tendency towards insiderism, the construction of the “boum”—American politics would have some work to do before it could once again call itself a worthwhile organ of a government that pretends to democracy.\r\n\r\nEven now, in the wake of a disastrous election, the Democrats’ discussion of the future seems less interested in lasting change than more of the same. Take, for example, the theater in which a recent discussion took place. The New York Times reports that “Most of the party’s biggest names headed to former Clinton campaign adviser James Carville’s party at the old Arkansas Gazette Building, which served as the headquarters of Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign. Some partied at Doe’s Eat Place, an old Democratic hangout” (Democrats 1). That gathering sounds like a smaller version of this summer’s convention: elite figures discussing the nation’s future over cocktails. The words “old Democratic hangout” fall harshly upon my ears. But even the discourse itself comes up short. Governor Bill Richardson says, “I remember being on a trip with him in New Mexico: I put a cowboy hat on Senator Kerry and someone on his staff shuddered and asked me to stop. This is I think an example of the East Coast not connecting with the West Coast and with the rest of the country” (Nagourney 2). If Governor Richardson is right, this country is in a sad place: he believes it is more effective to pander to the “rest of the country” through empty props than actually to address issues they care about. Surely it’s less—not more—of Richardson’s theatrics that the political process needs.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I am simply unschooled in politics’ dark arts. Surely there are mysteries I cannot comprehend. After all, I am merely a has-been pink-cheeked young aide, stepping softly through the snow to meet up with my friend. If I was an insider before, by now I am a definite outsider. Apparently, you need not be one or the other to care. As for those thinking citizens, hibernating with stacks of the New Yorker, I found them in the Kirkland dining hall, discussing the Warren Court for a paper due in three days. Outside, on the trees and in the gardens, across the lawns and in the sky, the falling snow cleansed the canvas, painting over everything with a broad white stroke. Preparation for rebirth had already begun, for the winter always precedes the spring.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWorks Cited\r\n\r\nDavid, Paul T., Ralph M.

I was back in Harvard Square, where I had lived the preceding summer while interning at the Democratic National Convention. I was pleased to return, but I knew it was to a different place. Out of Town News, Harvard Yard, the Quad, Felipe’s Taqueria: none of them were the same—the landscape had changed. The musicians had left the streets to find a lonely coffeehouse mic. The LaRouche proselytizers had left to hibernate for another four years. The t-shirts and sandals of summer sun had retreated in the face of winter’s austere countenance. My political innocence was gone, as well. Two weeks ago, the election had fallen upon me with all the heavy weight of reality. Challenged by the outcome, I was a changed person looking at a changed landscape: over everything, an inch of fresh snow.\r\n\r\nI walked slowly to my friend’s dorm where I would be spending the weekend. Quiet lingered in the air. I could hear the soft crunch of New Balance on slush. It was as if the election had hastened the arrival of winter, as if the capitol of liberal politics was eager to retreat to the safety of the fireside. There, in oak-paneled studies with bookcases, thinking citizens would insulate themselves from the anti-intellectual New America, thumbing endlessly through back copies of the <em>New Yorker</em>, mourning past evocations of hope and possibility. I peered through the humble Puritan windowpanes along Dunster Street, convinced that those citizens were in each room. I watched my breath disappear in the falling snow, wondering where American borders really lie.\r\n\r\nByron E. Shafer opens his book <em>Bifurcated Politics</em> by admitting, “Even in an era when it is widely viewed as an institution in decline, the national party convention retains a certain immediate, raw, and visceral fascination” (1). I can sympathize. As a young politico working the convention, being in such a high-level political environment was exciting. I spoke to Jesse Jackson and James Carville on the phone. Terry McAuliffe (T-Mac to those in the know) was constantly in my midst. I shook hands with Barack Obama and Larry David, and I took a picture with George McGovern. Teresa Heinz Kerry signed my poster. I patiently awaited my CNN interview with cellphone in hand and credentials around my neck.\r\n\r\nWhat I was less apt to recognize was the “institution in decline” part of the experience. We the convention committee (in order to form a more perfect union), perched atop a skyscraper looking down on the Old State House, would hear about Mayor Menino’s problems with the police union. We would hear that Boston was going to lose—rather than gain, as was originally believed—significant sums of money on the convention. We would hear the complaints of Bostonians: too much traffic, altered public transportation, increased terrorist threat. We would hear, but we weren’t really listening. After all, they, the complainers, were on the outside. They couldn’t understand that it was all necessary. What did they know?\r\n\r\nIn her essay “Insider Baseball,” Joan Didion speaks to my experience. Writing about the Dukakis campaign of 1988, she considers the “assumption” of people within politics that “the narrative should be not just written only by its own specialists but also legible only to its own specialists” (50). Part of me thought that since I had an ID card that said DNC 2004 on it, I was more qualified to assess the convention. Those on the other side of the glass didn’t really know what they were talking about.\r\n\r\nDidion also details a scene in which Dukakis plays catch with one of his campaign aides on an airport tarmac. Didion writes:\r\n<blockquote>What we had in the tarmac arrival with ball tossing, then, was an understanding: a repeated moment witnessed by many people, all of whom believed it to be a setup and yet most of whom believed that only an outsider, only someone too ‘naïve’ to know the rules of the game, would so describe it. (65)</blockquote>\r\nDamned if I would be naïve. A friend of mine who had worked on the Dean campaign in New Hampshire (and was now in Vietnam on a fellowship) complained about the unnecessary level of control and choreography that he saw going into the convention. I told him it was all necessary: the lighting cues, the careful choice of music, the placement of the delegations on the floor, the speakers’ obligation to submit speeches beforehand for approval. “We can’t risk a disorganized appearance,” I insisted, “there is too much at stake.” What we needed, I believed (not uniquely, I might add), was to project an image of unified professionalism that would dispel, among other things, notions of a party torn by an extraordinarily divisive primary season. John Kerry was our man, and he would deliver us from George W. Bush’s dark presidency. Any calls for a more natural political forum misunderstood political strategy. Those who made those calls were, by definition, “outsiders.”\r\n\r\nThe narrative of insiderism that the convention unwittingly created proved to be destructive to its appeal. A bubble—dreaded in theory, embraced in practice—surrounded all things DNC. I remember on Thursday night, the last night of the whole spectacle, my friend Eric, who was interning for CNN, was able to get me into a party at the Roxy. Maroon 5 played the event. In the middle of the set, John Edwards—sleeves rolled up, tie loosened, mic in hand—appeared onstage in front of a dramatic green light as a fog machine did its thing. He looked heroic, almost godlike. He engaged the crowd: “This may look like a concert, this may feel like a concert, and this may sound like a concert.” The crowd quieted. We waited for his words. “But this is a movement.” We erupted. We were, of course, ready to cheer.\r\n\r\nEven this memory—one I recall so fondly—has paled since the election. Whereas I originally experienced it in terms of Shafer’s raw, visceral fascination, now I can’t help but see the shadow of decay about it, evidence of a declining institution. There I stood with two different credentials (one for the Fleet, one for the Roxy) in the plastic sleeve on my “Democrats Win It in the Field” lanyard, supposedly affirming some sort of “movement.” Was this the field? Was this where we were supposed to win it? After leaving one closed event, I was now at another closed event, both of which had further levels of exclusivity within them. Even worse, we—supposedly the party of the First Amendment—feared protests so much that we restricted peaceful demonstrations to an aptly named “Free Speech Zone” festooned with nets to “protect the delegates.” On the closing night of the convention, I stared as hundreds of police donned storm trooper riot gear and clogged the surrounding streets.\r\n\r\nWe assumed the movement Edwards referred to must have been some sort of popular uprising against the Republicans.

Yet only four years later, it was the Republican convention which manifested the major candidate conflict, along with exacerbating issue divisions, while the Democratic convention escaped candidate splits entirely and surfaced only minor issue conflicts to fuel its limited struggles. (150)</blockquote>\r\nIn both 1972 and 1976, the party that presented a more unified convention won the general election. This contrast between unity and disunity, unity triumphing each time, proved to be a lesson politicians would not soon forget. With the potential for a divisive primary season constantly threatening to produce an image of a party in conflict, conventions began to focus energy on polished appearance rather than honest debate. Disunity, an ominous sign of weakness, took on the characteristics of a risk to avoid at all costs.\r\n\r\nFor better or for worse, it seems the Democrats know their history. The 1970s conventions set a precedent—unity at all costs—that the national parties emulate to this day. One can imagine T-Mac and convention CEO Rod O’Connor sitting in a well-lit office late at night pondering the official convention slogan. America 2004: The Democratic Convention, or America 2004: A Stronger America? The differences are subtle, even aesthetic. But by July 26, the message had changed from the former to the latter. There could be nothing weak about this convention; history warns as much. “Strong” necessarily conjures images of unity, for strength is predicated on organized support. At the expense of a real political forum, we proceed with this historically fortified notion of strength, for we have learned the lessons of the ’70s. Certainly “unschooled” has never been an accusation leveled at Democrats. Nevertheless, the Golden Age of conventions is dead, and even the current age declines. Surely Swinburne waxed rhetorical when he asked, “Is not Precedent a king of men?”\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNow that the post-election pall had descended and winter had frozen over Harvard Square, I began to reevaluate my memories. After all, “we” had lost. This summer, good little Democrat that I was, I probably would have described the color of the convention as some sort of fluorescent blue. Now I might side with the dreaded gray. Neither red nor blue, Republican nor Democratic, just—gray. Perhaps my experience of disillusionment is simply a function of election depression. Or perhaps the election has been my apple, and I have eaten of it. Either way, I recall feeling like we had something—whether it was momentum, passion, or truth on our side, I’m not sure. But there was something that has faded now.\r\n\r\nThe November issue of <em>Harper’s</em>, which was released before the election, aptly demonstrates the Democrats’ obsession with presenting a united front. Ironically, it is Luke Mitchell’s essay about the Republican convention that accomplishes this, even as he lets the Democrats off the hook. He writes, “Whereas Kerry had struggled to create meaning—no matter how stupid, dishonest, or clichéd that meaning was—Bush’s team seemed actively to be plotting its demise” (67). Mitchell treats Kerry kindly, keenly aware of the approaching Tuesday. Mitchell continues, considering the discussion that took place in the Garden: “These were half-narratives, made up of questions so preposterous as to end discussion and possibly even subvert our understanding of what it means to mean something…The real message, radiating from the podium and echoing through the rafters, was that there was no message” (67). It is not difficult to imagine a covert Luke Mitchell marooned in The Red Sea, subconsciously holding his nose while straining his ears to catch the words between the echoes. The fact that he couldn’t decipher any message suggests that the Republicans know their historical precedents, too: Organization at the expense of meaning.\r\n\r\nBut now that the election is over and all may speak freely, one must wonder if Mitchell would still excuse Kerry. Perhaps not—I, for one, with hindsight shaded by the election, find his appraisal of the Republicans quite applicable to the Democrats. The Dems’ platform professes “a profound optimism about our future—an optimism that springs from our great faith in America” (Strong 1). In terms of gritty policy-talk that one might expect from a political platform, the document sounds more like a stump speech. It avoids confronting Iraq, turning that question instead into a section called “Strengthening Our Military.” It says, “We will add 40,000 new soldiers—not to increase the number of soldiers in Iraq, but to sustain our overseas deployments and prevent and prepare for other possible conflicts” (13). Worse, the title of the platform, the overall message, amounts to more of a non-message: “Strong at Home, Respected in the World.” Who can argue with such a stance? Is it a stance? The statement is eternally malleable: Anyone could mold it to his or her particular ideology. It is both isolationist and internationalist. It is both militant and gradualist. In essence, it is both liberal and conservative. It draws no lines, because it comes down on the side of no one. Even as the Dems tried to learn from history’s convenient lessons, they came up short. The Democratic message tried to be all things to all people—and still the electoral map bleeds endlessly. Perhaps we spoke directly to no one. Such is the risk of a politics of caution. In my own words, “There is too much at stake.”\r\n\r\nMitchell realizes that risk. In a later passage in his essay, he discusses the effort of the Republican convention to appear completely inoffensive, an effort I found similar to the Democrats’. He tries to recount the atmosphere of the Garden to a friend, who refers him to E.M. Forster’s <em>A Passage to India</em>. “It’s the Marabar Caves,” his friend tells him. Mitchell notes, “He was almost impossibly right.” Forster describes the caves:\r\n<blockquote>Whatever is said, the same monotonous noise replies, and quivers up and down the walls until it is absorbed into the roof. “Boum” is the sound as far as the human alphabet can express it, or “bou-oum,” or “ou-boum,” ­ utterly dull. Hope, politeness, the blowing of a nose, the squeak of a boot, all produce “boum”…. (68)</blockquote>\r\nIn a literal sense, the Marabar Caves recall to me the first night of the convention, when I was sitting very high up in the Fleet Center, straining my ears to hear the Clintons. The echoes were definitely overwhelming at times, and I missed much of what was said. But Mitchell cites Forster to get at something deeper. What Mitchell is concerned about is the conscious decision to sterilize discourse, to the extent that blowing one’s nose and expressions of hope both sound like “boum.” Both parties are guilty of this transgression; most likely the Republicans just play the game better. Forster realizes this, too. In the same passage, he writes, “Echoes generate echoes.” Today, echoes generate elections.\r\n\r\nAs I approached Kirkland House, my friend’s Harvard dorm, I took my earbuds out so I could concentrate on the directions he had given me. First gate on the right, proceed into the courtyard, turn left, look for the dining hall. No one had shoveled the walkway in the courtyard yet; I left footprints in the snow as I walked towards the door. Through the tall windows, I could see chandeliers and crowded tables. It looked warm inside.\r\n\r\nMonths before, we had visited this building, often late at night, so that my friend (who also interned with me) could show me where he would be living for the next three years of college. Another friend of his was spending the summer in the next house over, Eliot House, so we would go there, too, and we would have long political discussions in the night. We were like the “pink-cheeked young aides” Didion recalls in her essay, thinking of ourselves, “innocent of irony and therefore history, as ‘the best and the brightest’” (56). It rarely—if ever—occurred to me that the next time I would return, winter’s cold winds would have swooped down on the wings of the election to clear the landscape. There was an air of immortality about our convention work that summer. I assumed victory and the concomitant vindication would have taken place by now. From the heights of the Fleet Center, defeat looked impossible.\r\n\r\nIn <em>The Politics of National Party Conventions</em>, David, Goldman and Bain write: “Convention decisions cut close to the great political concerns of any society: the allocation of political power, the purposes for which political power shall be used, and the further evolution of the political system” (2). As a representative institution, as a symbol of a larger political process, the convention does not bode well for the future of politics. If the characteristics of this summer’s Democratic convention were to continue—the tendency towards insiderism, the construction of the “boum”—American politics would have some work to do before it could once again call itself a worthwhile organ of a government that pretends to democracy.\r\n\r\nEven now, in the wake of a disastrous election, the Democrats’ discussion of the future seems less interested in lasting change than more of the same. Take, for example, the theater in which a recent discussion took place. The New York Times reports that “Most of the party’s biggest names headed to former Clinton campaign adviser James Carville’s party at the old Arkansas Gazette Building, which served as the headquarters of Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign. Some partied at Doe’s Eat Place, an old Democratic hangout” (Democrats 1). That gathering sounds like a smaller version of this summer’s convention: elite figures discussing the nation’s future over cocktails. The words “old Democratic hangout” fall harshly upon my ears. But even the discourse itself comes up short. Governor Bill Richardson says, “I remember being on a trip with him in New Mexico: I put a cowboy hat on Senator Kerry and someone on his staff shuddered and asked me to stop. This is I think an example of the East Coast not connecting with the West Coast and with the rest of the country” (Nagourney 2). If Governor Richardson is right, this country is in a sad place: he believes it is more effective to pander to the “rest of the country” through empty props than actually to address issues they care about. Surely it’s less—not more—of Richardson’s theatrics that the political process needs.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I am simply unschooled in politics’ dark arts. Surely there are mysteries I cannot comprehend. After all, I am merely a has-been pink-cheeked young aide, stepping softly through the snow to meet up with my friend. If I was an insider before, by now I am a definite outsider. Apparently, you need not be one or the other to care. As for those thinking citizens, hibernating with stacks of the New Yorker, I found them in the Kirkland dining hall, discussing the Warren Court for a paper due in three days. Outside, on the trees and in the gardens, across the lawns and in the sky, the falling snow cleansed the canvas, painting over everything with a broad white stroke. Preparation for rebirth had already begun, for the winter always precedes the spring.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWorks Cited\r\n\r\nDavid, Paul T., Ralph M.

(508, 3, '2012-04-10 20:16:14', '2012-04-10 20:16:14', 'My favorite piece of stand up comedy, without a doubt, comes from Louis C.K.‘s comedy special <em>Chewed Up. </em>The entire work is unbelievably funny; but there is one moment—one golden, rambling tangent that stands out from the rest. Roughly in the middle of the show,  he sighs and, looking at the audience, says, “I don’t know why I’m complaining about all of this. I’m young, I’m happy, I’m relatively healthy… I’m white.” The audience titters. “I love being white,” he continues. “I really do. If you’re not white, you’re missing out.” He explains to the audience that being white is so special, that if he had a time machine, he would be able to travel to any time and know that it would be “awesome.” “That is an exclusively white male privilege,” he continues. “A black guy in a time machine is like ‘Hey, anything before 1980 – no thank you.”\r\n\r\nI laughed at this joke harder than I had laughed at his others. I shared it with my friends, posted it in video form on a friend’s Facebook wall, and emailed it to my parents. What I did not do—what I never did, notably, was examine why I was laughing. There is absolutely nothing intrinsically humorous about the situation and the world that Louis C.K. describes. Although what he says is twisted, it is also true. How would the movie <em>Back To The Future</em> work if Marty McFly were a woman, or a minority traveling back to the 1950s? I am the polar opposite of a white man. I am black and female. There are two charges against me—I can never time travel. And yet, I laughed at Louis C.K.’s comedic discussion of race and gender. There is something truly singular about comedy—something that allows us all, black and white, male and female, to laugh at the evoking of tortured pasts. Why do we laugh at things that are not funny?\r\n\r\nThe essay “Behind the Official Story” by James Scott examines how power relations distort communication. Although Scott specifically examines hierarchical relationships – for example, how what is said between the landowner and the serf differs from what is said between serfs – his discussion can be generalized also to communication between <em>all </em>unequal groups, such as that between the privileged and unprivileged or the parent and the child. Scott simply seeks to examine communication between those who hold power and those who do not – of which a white man making a time travel joke is an example. There is a subtle discussion of power that takes place under the humor. The joke pits two unequal groups against each other for humorous effect – Louis C.K the time traveler and the audience members who share his white, male privilege versus the comedian and the minority and female audience members who do not share his privilege. It is thus helpful to use Scott’s analysis to understand how such comedy works.\r\n\r\nScott divides communication into two spheres.  The “public transcript” refers to communication that takes place between the dominant and the subordinate, the advantaged and the disadvantaged in normal society. It is difficult to gain a true understanding of events from the public transcript alone, for it is “unlikely to tell the whole story” (2). The conversations that take place between boss and employee, teacher and student all reside within the public transcript. Within the public transcript, the subordinates hide their true feelings under a mask of subservience and the advantaged ignore the issues at hand, which may threaten the legitimacy of their  power.  In another manner of speaking, the public transcript is the stage unto which we are all constantly placed in our day-to-day life; the audience chitchat before the curtain rises and Louis C.K. appears.  When we are in the public eye, it is easier to be inoffensive than honest. Even if the time travel joke is fundamentally true, there is something blunt about it that makes it fundamentally inappropriate for a politician to say to her constituents, or a teacher to his students. It does not belong in the public transcript.\r\n\r\nThe other sphere of communication is the “hidden transcript,” defined by Scott as  “discourse that takes place offstage, beyond direct observation by power holders ... produced for a different audience and under different constraints of power.”(4) The hidden transcript is the face behind the mask, the candid counterpart to the public transcript where true feelings can be expressed openly. The hidden transcript is the element that is elusive in history and yet key to understanding everything. As Scott says, “We cannot know how contrived or imposed the performance is… unless we speak to the performer offstage.” (4)\r\n\r\nDespite the candid quality of the time travel joke, applying the hidden transcript definition to it—and comedy as a whole—complicates matters. Comedy does not really fall under this sphere. The hidden transcript is “hidden” because it takes place out of sight of normal life and is discussed with the members of the same “class position” and “social links” (8). It is the conversation between serfs or landowners, but not both. It is produced between members of the same power strata, it is the water cooler conversation at the office. Scott also argues that this distinction between the hidden and the public is almost always exclusive: “the hidden transcripts of dominant and subordinate are, in most circumstances never in <em>direct contact</em>… each participant will be aware of the public transcript and the hidden transcript of his or her circle, but not with the hidden transcript of the other.” (15) Comedy is forged in the discussions and issues of our times. It, by nature of having a large, popular audience, reaches out to society as a whole. This joke, and much of race and gender humor, is performed in the company of both the privileged and the unprivileged and laughed at both alike. There is something about humor that defies Scott’s classification – it utterly rejects this binary model.\r\n\r\nBut what kind of communication is comedy, then, if neither private nor public?  At the end of Scott’s essay, he declares that the key matter is not the public or hidden transcript but the discrepancy between the two. Examining “the dialectic of disguise and surveillance that pervades relations” (4), Scott argues, will allow us to assess the impact of power and privilege on discourse. That includes—even if it is uncomfortable—exploring “the realm of the hidden transcript” (16). Scott does not explain on which level of communication this discussion can take place. He does not name the forum in which these differences and gaps can be revealed and discussed by the public at large. I offer comedy as a possibility.\r\n\r\nComedy can serve to expose the gap between what we may think or feel—the most <em>hidden</em> of transcripts—and what we permit ourselves to say in the company of others. Comedy helps express these differences in a nonaggressive manner. The time-travel joke is made up of many stark contrasts: the seriousness of the inequities that Louis C.K. discusses against the lighthearted background of the time machine, the sober quality of the subject matter against the frank honesty with which C.K. describes the advantages society has given him. Perhaps, for this reason, there is no person in the world more honest than a comedian. A comedian on a stage may admit uncomfortable truths that most people cannot. Comedians can admit to harboring mildly racist thoughts, enjoying undue privileges, hating children. We, the audience, publicly laugh at the time-travel joke, but we simultaneously acknowledge the truth behind it. Comedy allows us to step back and laugh at seemingly unspeakable thoughts, i.e., to laugh at the power we have over others and the power others have over us.\r\n\r\nThus, comedy plays a unique role in our lives. Comedy serves as a safety valve wherein we can voice uncomfortable issues and problems of our day. There is something welcoming about the light-hearted nature of comedy: we know subconsciously that the principal role of the comedian is to entertain us and make us laugh. Even if that same person has the power to challenge our assumptions about society or even make us uneasy, these intentions are clearly secondary. After all, we say a comic who veers closer to the uneasiness than the fun has “gone too far”. We give ourselves wholly to the blown up, hyperbolic world that the comedian presents, but there is a serious truth under this illusion. Sometimes, the juxtaposition of an uncomfortable truth with the brightness of laughter and stage lights—for example, the unexpected idea of racism and sexism affecting time travel—is amusing. When we are around comedians, we shed our defenses. We are willing to risk offense for the sake of humor in a way that we are not in everyday life, where we must “sacrifice candor for smooth relations” (1).  We laugh at things that aren’t funny under any other conditions.\r\n\r\nScott suggests that it is power and domination that distort our ability to have meaningful conversations.  We know subconsciously that we aren’t on a level playing field, and that knowledge changes our ability to communicate for the worse. The subordinates must cloy for acceptance and the advantaged depend on masks to justify their power. Scott claims that “the greater the disparity in power between dominant and subordinate and the more arbitrarily it is exercised... the more the public transcript between the subordinates will take on a stereotyped, ritualistic case.” Still, he suggests that one can reverse engineer the situation. If power changes communication, one can learn more about the degree of domination in a society by examining what its citizens feel comfortable enough to say in public. The more insincere the public transcript, the greater the power disparity between the two groups.\r\n\r\nThe same insight can be gleaned from comedy in America. If comedy provides a safe channel wherein one can bring the hidden transcript to light, perhaps one can use the presence or absence of comedy to learn more about power relationships within society. There is something brilliantly liberating about living under a government that is receptive to mocking. There is something truly remarkable that we have comedic news publications like the <em>The Onion</em>, and news programs, like <em>The Daily Show</em>, that exist solely to satirize current events. A democracy that refreshes its leadership periodically with regular elections does not need to hide behind a mask of propriety to legitimize its existence. A dictatorship cannot enjoy that same freedom. Comedy is not a right, but a privilege of free people. The time-travel joke tells us that we live in a free society.  We have the power to laugh at our less powerful situation. It is something we can all do together— even if we can’t all time travel.', 'Time Travel Isn’t Funny: Power Dynamics and Humor', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'time-travel-isnt-funny-power-dynamics-and-humor', '', '', '2012-04-10 20:16:53', '2012-04-10 20:16:53', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=508', 0, 'essay', '', 0),

There is something brilliantly liberating about living under a government that is receptive to mocking. There is something truly remarkable that we have comedic news publications like the <em>The Onion</em>, and news programs, like <em>The Daily Show</em>, that exist solely to satirize current events. A democracy that refreshes its leadership periodically with regular elections does not need to hide behind a mask of propriety to legitimize its existence. A dictatorship cannot enjoy that same freedom. Comedy is not a right, but a privilege of free people. The time-travel joke tells us that we live in a free society.  We have the power to laugh at our less powerful situation. It is something we can all do together— even if we can’t all time travel.', 'Time Travel Isn’t Funny: Power Dynamics and Humor', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '508-autosave', '', '', '2012-04-10 20:18:35', '2012-04-10 20:18:35', '', 508, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?p=509', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

(26, 4, '2011-11-21 15:34:21', '2011-11-21 15:34:21', 'I was delighted to discover that there is a Halal section of food in the John Jay Dining Hall at Columbia University. Though it is true that I do not always eat strictly Halal food, most of the time I do look around to see if there is a Halal sign nearby before stumbling towards a pile of regular meat. For an animal’s meat to be Halal, according to Islam, the animal has to be sacrificed following some specific rules, including slaughtering the animal in the least painful manner and only in the name of Almighty Allah. If the animal is not slaughtered following this specific “Halal code,” then its meat is Haram, or forbidden. Though my pursuit to eat Halal is mainly a result of my strong religious viewpoint, it is also true that my belief in the need for compassion for animals plays a large part in it as well. But in saying this, the biggest question that I often have to face is: if “compassion” for animals, then why “animal sacrifice” in the first place?\r\n<h2>DONIGER AND SCULLY: AT THE CROSSROADS OF BELIEFS</h2>\r\nIn <em>The Lives of Animals</em>, J.M. Coetzee introduces readers to a fictional character, Elizabeth Costello, who passionately cares about animal rights, partly because of her own self-interest—the desire to protect her own soul from pollution (Doniger 93). In the same book, Wendy Doniger, in a reflection on Coetzee’s text, focuses on the relationship between self-interest and vegetarianism from the perspective of some non-Western religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, and argues that the idea of treating animals humanely for our own self-interest is indeed very wise. “After about the sixth century B.C.E., most Hindus, Buddhists, and Jains did indeed feel that people should not eat animals, in part, as is generally argued, because they themselves might be reborn as animals, but more because they feared that animals might retaliate in the afterworld” (Doniger 93). Familiarizing readers with some Hindu and Buddhist texts, myths, and notions, Doniger states that “compassion” for animals is rarely an important factor in the South Asian arguments for vegetarianism (97). Though Doniger does not define the term “compassion” explicitly, she indirectly specifies its meaning as care and kindness throughout the essay. “Buddhists and Jains cared, like Elizabeth Costello, for individual human salvation, more, really, than they cared for animals; they refrained from killing and eating animals to protect their own souls from pollution” (Doniger 98).\r\n\r\nWhile presenting the long-held beliefs of non-Western religions concerning animals, Doniger argues that we should consider some of their wise ideas as well, such as treating animals humanely for human benefits. As she goes on to say, “So, too, whether or not we can argue that killing animals for food or experimentation is bad for the universe, for the food supply…we might take from the South Asian context the very wise argument that we know that they are going to die, and that that makes it bad for us to kill them” (98). This actually seems like a persuasive argument—one that resembles the viewpoint of Matthew Scully, another animal rights advocate and author of the book Dominion. A devoted Christian, Matthew Scully believes that we should treat animals humanely, not because they have rights but because they stand powerless in front of us. Similarly to Doniger, Scully does not emphasize “compassion” for animals—providing animals with rights in this case. However, Scully strongly believes that it is our moral obligation to treat animals humanely. According to him, “We have no duties to the creatures, but only duties in respect of animals” (341). One of his most prominent arguments is that “[a] sin always hurts the sinner more than the victim, estranging the offender from God and risking an eternal fate far worse than any hurt he or she has caused” (348-349). Therefore, Scully argues that we should not subject animals to human cruelty, as “a matter of simple decency and an obligation of justice” (349).\r\n<h2>AND…ISLAM: NEED FOR “COMPASSION”</h2>\r\nThough Doniger looks at “compassion” for animals and vegetarianism from the perspective of some important non-Western religions, she somehow does not mention anything about Islam—a prominent non-Western religion and currently the second-largest world religion. Meat-eating is neither recommended nor forbidden in Islam but for those of us who wish to eat meat, there are some specific rules that we must follow. Making sure that the knife used for slaughter is sharpened so that little pain is inflicted on the animal, not slaughtering animals while they are tied up, and making sure that animals have not been subjected to cruelties during breeding, transporting, or slaughtering are a few of the many requirements for any meat to be Halal. Most of these Islamic laws seem to be based on a sense of “compassion”—kindness, and care for animals. Numerous verses of the Qur’an suggest this idea, including the following one, which gives animals a distinct place along with the humans in the eyes of the Lord: “There is not an animal [that lives] on the earth, nor a being that flies on its wings, but [forms part of] communities like you. Nothing have we omitted from the Book, and they [all] shall be gathered to their Lord in the end” (Yusuf Ali, Qur’an 6:38). Growing up in a conservative Muslim family, my beliefs about “compassion”—kindness, care, respect—and proper treatment of animals, have been derived largely from those views endorsed by my religion, Islam.\r\n\r\nThe basic lesson of both Scully and Doniger’s commendable works is that a deed in this life will pay off soon in the next one; therefore one should think twice before doing a misdeed. Though my views concerning the need to treat animals humanely are quite similar to both of these authors, I would actually take a step forward from Doniger and Scully’s arguments for self-interest in the afterlife and argue for the “need for compassion” for animals in present life. If I care only about my own fate and do not hold any real “compassion” towards animals, then am I really following the words of God—or, rather, fulfilling the responsibility that the Creator has given me in present life for being a moral living being? Scully touches upon this, saying that we fulfill our duties as fathers, husbands, mothers, neighbors, etc.; so why should we not also do it as stewards of the earth, the caretakers of the creation (311-312)? I agree with Scully here. In addition to worrying that ‘what goes around, comes around,’ it is part of our moral obligation or responsibility as humans to develop “compassion” for those other living beings who are sharing the earth with us.\r\n<h2>THEN WHY MEAT-EATING AND ANIMAL SACRIFICE?</h2>\r\nNow some difficult questions arise. If I hold such strong compassion for animals, then why I am not a vegetarian? If I say that it is our moral obligation to treat animals humanely, then why do I support the sacrifice of animals in the name of God? In Dominion, Scully relates how after writing an article about animal rights and vegetarianism for The National Review, he was amazed by “the volume and indignation of the letters” that came back to him, most of which were from men who talked about how “they liked their meat” and who suggested Scully drop the matter and mind his own business (319). Not surprisingly, Scully was offended by such comments and therefore defends his position in Dominion saying, “What are all these hardy menfolk really defending here? A pleasure. A flavor. A feeling in their bellies” (319). We have to eat meat—Scully castigates this social notion immensely throughout his essay.\r\n\r\nWell, it is true that some people take meat-eating as a pleasure, sometimes not even caring or realizing what the animal has go through to become his dinner. But Scully overlooks the fact that all the fingers in a hand are not the same—not all human beings are the same and not all think the same way. As a meat-eater, I always feel obligated to consider whether the animal has been slaughtered humanely before devouring its meat. It seems like vegetarianism is the only solution Scully supports as a way to treat animals humanely. While reading his arguments, I found myself wondering, can we not combine meat-eating and “compassion” for animals? Is vegetarianism the only way to free animals from the barbaric deeds of humans?\r\n\r\nLet me tell you a story. Eid-Ul-Azha is one of those two Muslim holidays that every year brings happiness and excitement to every Muslim’s life. As a child, I always looked forward to it for many different reasons. One of the most prominent of them was experiencing Qurbani—the process of sacrificing/dedicating animals in the name of Almighty Allah; this is how all meat is derived from animals in Islam.\r\n\r\nOne year, when I was around 7 years old, a soon-to-be sacrificed cow stepped into our big farm house one morning. We were all as excited as usual, especially me. Sitting next to the newly bought cow and talking to him was my daily job during the days before Qurbani. We took special care of him at that time—feeding him more, behaving with extra compassion towards him. I used to put my little hands on his enormous body, talk to him with my other cousins, sometimes feed him. He had beautiful eyes, so black, so deep! Somehow, teardrops always dropped down from his eyes. When I asked my mom about this, she replied, “He knows that the day of sacrifice is coming soon, that’s why!”\r\n\r\nThen the day of Qurbani arrived. The first thing I did that morning was run to see him and talk to him for what would be the last time in my life. Our huzur—the priest—soon came. Around eight people approached, getting ready to help the huzur do his job properly. I was watching everything from far away. The cow seemed to be mourning, making a slight noise; suddenly that slender cry transformed into an overwhelming scream. The sound of it crossed beyond our visual limits, mingling with the unlimited horizon of the unknown. It was probably the loudest scream I ever heard. I couldn’t help but step back. Four men held his legs with great force; another two men held his horns, and the last man caressed his back lovingly. The noises he was making eased now—he seemed to find comfort in those hands. The huzur started to read Dua—prayer—before placing the sharpened knife carefully next to his throat… a stream of blood flowed down, more drops of tears and a moment of silence…\r\n\r\nScully or Doniger or similar animal rights supporters would probably focus on the cruelty of such an event. It does actually seem very cruel if you are an outsider, just reading the description, not realizing the significance and profoundness of the beliefs of the people in the scene. Scully wrote Dominion based on his Christian beliefs and argued for his ideas in the case of animal rights as a devoted Christian; Doniger focused on “compassion” for animals from religious perspectives as well, advising us to take the “wise argument” of South Asian religions—all of which portray the way religious beliefs affected their viewpoints on “the proper way of treating animals.” I would say that the same applies to my case.\r\n\r\nI believe, as the Qur’an says, “It is not their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah: it is your piety that reaches Him…” (Yusuf Ali, Qur’an 22:37). In Islam, it is advised that a large portion of the meat from the animal you sacrifice is distributed among your neighbors, relatives and mostly the poor. It is not only for your own pleasure in eating it. It is a form of charity, a form of showing dedication—not only to Allah but to your fellow human beings. The Qur’an says, “That they may witness the benefits (provided) for them, and celebrate the name of Allah, through the Days appointed, over the cattle which He has provided for them [for sacrifice]: then eat ye thereof and feed the distressed ones in want” (Yusuf Ali, Qur’an 22:28).\r\n\r\nWhat does the animal have to go through to accomplish all this? I would answer this by saying: he has been dedicated for a justifiable reason and has not been treated cruelly in his lifetime, has been slaughtered in the least painful manner—otherwise the meat is Haram—and now has reached the end of his life. After all, death is inevitable for every living being, isn’t it? And moreover, we have more obligation to human beings than to animals, don’t we? I grew up believing this. I am not against vegetarianism but I do believe “compassion” for animals and meat-eating can be combined. Though our first moral obligation as a human being is to care for our own society and for the fellow human beings living in it, this definitely does not mean that we should only utilize other living beings cruelly for our own good. Even as meat-eaters, treating animals humanely, with compassion, kindness, and respect while they are alive or even being slaughtered is our foremost moral obligation.\r\n<h2>EPILOGUE</h2>\r\nNow, this essay would be incomplete if I didn’t dedicate this last paragraph to that great friend of mine—someone who made me realize “the need for compassion,” someone who made me understand that taking life away from a living being is not child’s play—that therefore it must be done with respect; animals too need respect. So—there he lay, dead. I stepped forward towards the blood that made our cream-colored backyard red—the color of both sunrise and sunset. But it was only the color of sunrise for me because I loved him and he had been dedicated for a good reason. I believed it then and I still do now.', 'Compassion and Sacrifice ', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'compassion-and-sacrifice', '', '', '2012-02-27 04:10:59', '2012-02-27 04:10:59', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?p=26', 0, 'essay', '', 0),

In the same book, Wendy Doniger, in a reflection on Coetzee’s text, focuses on the relationship between self-interest and vegetarianism from the perspective of some non-Western religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, and argues that the idea of treating animals humanely for our own self-interest is indeed very wise. “After about the sixth century B.C.E., most Hindus, Buddhists, and Jains did indeed feel that people should not eat animals, in part, as is generally argued, because they themselves might be reborn as animals, but more because they feared that animals might retaliate in the afterworld” (Doniger 93). Familiarizing readers with some Hindu and Buddhist texts, myths, and notions, Doniger states that “compassion” for animals is rarely an important factor in the South Asian arguments for vegetarianism (97). Though Doniger does not define the term “compassion” explicitly, she indirectly specifies its meaning as care and kindness throughout the essay. “Buddhists and Jains cared, like Elizabeth Costello, for individual human salvation, more, really, than they cared for animals; they refrained from killing and eating animals to protect their own souls from pollution” (Doniger 98).\r\n\r\nWhile presenting the long-held beliefs of non-Western religions concerning animals, Doniger argues that we should consider some of their wise ideas as well, such as treating animals humanely for human benefits. As she goes on to say, “So, too, whether or not we can argue that killing animals for food or experimentation is bad for the universe, for the food supply…we might take from the South Asian context the very wise argument that we know that they are going to die, and that that makes it bad for us to kill them” (98). This actually seems like a persuasive argument—one that resembles the viewpoint of Matthew Scully, another animal rights advocate and author of the book Dominion. A devoted Christian, Matthew Scully believes that we should treat animals humanely, not because they have rights but because they stand powerless in front of us. Similarly to Doniger, Scully does not emphasize “compassion” for animals—providing animals with rights in this case. However, Scully strongly believes that it is our moral obligation to treat animals humanely. According to him, “We have no duties to the creatures, but only duties in respect of animals” (341). One of his most prominent arguments is that “[a] sin always hurts the sinner more than the victim, estranging the offender from God and risking an eternal fate far worse than any hurt he or she has caused” (348-349). Therefore, Scully argues that we should not subject animals to human cruelty, as “a matter of simple decency and an obligation of justice” (349).\r\n\r\nAND…ISLAM: NEED FOR “COMPASSION”\r\n\r\nThough Doniger looks at “compassion” for animals and vegetarianism from the perspective of some important non-Western religions, she somehow does not mention anything about Islam—a prominent non-Western religion and currently the second-largest world religion. Meat-eating is neither recommended nor forbidden in Islam but for those of us who wish to eat meat, there are some specific rules that we must follow. Making sure that the knife used for slaughter is sharpened so that little pain is inflicted on the animal, not slaughtering animals while they are tied up, and making sure that animals have not been subjected to cruelties during breeding, transporting, or slaughtering are a few of the many requirements for any meat to be Halal. Most of these Islamic laws seem to be based on a sense of “compassion”—kindness, and care for animals. Numerous verses of the Qur’an suggest this idea, including the following one, which gives animals a distinct place along with the humans in the eyes of the Lord: “There is not an animal [that lives] on the earth, nor a being that flies on its wings, but [forms part of] communities like you. Nothing have we omitted from the Book, and they [all] shall be gathered to their Lord in the end” (Yusuf Ali, Qur’an 6:38). Growing up in a conservative Muslim family, my beliefs about “compassion”—kindness, care, respect—and proper treatment of animals, have been derived largely from those views endorsed by my religion, Islam.\r\n\r\nThe basic lesson of both Scully and Doniger’s commendable works is that a deed in this life will pay off soon in the next one; therefore one should think twice before doing a misdeed. Though my views concerning the need to treat animals humanely are quite similar to both of these authors, I would actually take a step forward from Doniger and Scully’s arguments for self-interest in the afterlife and argue for the “need for compassion” for animals in present life. If I care only about my own fate and do not hold any real “compassion” towards animals, then am I really following the words of God—or, rather, fulfilling the responsibility that the Creator has given me in present life for being a moral living being? Scully touches upon this, saying that we fulfill our duties as fathers, husbands, mothers, neighbors, etc.; so why should we not also do it as stewards of the earth, the caretakers of the creation (311-312)? I agree with Scully here. In addition to worrying that ‘what goes around, comes around,’ it is part of our moral obligation or responsibility as humans to develop “compassion” for those other living beings who are sharing the earth with us.\r\n\r\nTHEN WHY MEAT-EATING AND ANIMAL SACRIFICE?\r\n\r\nNow some difficult questions arise. If I hold such strong compassion for animals, then why I am not a vegetarian? If I say that it is our moral obligation to treat animals humanely, then why do I support the sacrifice of animals in the name of God? In Dominion, Scully relates how after writing an article about animal rights and vegetarianism for The National Review, he was amazed by “the volume and indignation of the letters” that came back to him, most of which were from men who talked about how “they liked their meat” and who suggested Scully drop the matter and mind his own business (319). Not surprisingly, Scully was offended by such comments and therefore defends his position in Dominion saying, “What are all these hardy menfolk really defending here? A pleasure. A flavor. A feeling in their bellies” (319). We have to eat meat—Scully castigates this social notion immensely throughout his essay.\r\n\r\nWell, it is true that some people take meat-eating as a pleasure, sometimes not even caring or realizing what the animal has go through to become his dinner. But Scully overlooks the fact that all the fingers in a hand are not the same—not all human beings are the same and not all think the same way. As a meat-eater, I always feel obligated to consider whether the animal has been slaughtered humanely before devouring its meat. It seems like vegetarianism is the only solution Scully supports as a way to treat animals humanely. While reading his arguments, I found myself wondering, can we not combine meat-eating and “compassion” for animals? Is vegetarianism the only way to free animals from the barbaric deeds of humans?\r\n\r\nLet me tell you a story. Eid-Ul-Azha is one of those two Muslim holidays that every year brings happiness and excitement to every Muslim’s life. As a child, I always looked forward to it for many different reasons. One of the most prominent of them was experiencing Qurbani—the process of sacrificing/dedicating animals in the name of Almighty Allah; this is how all meat is derived from animals in Islam.\r\n\r\nOne year, when I was around 7 years old, a soon-to-be sacrificed cow stepped into our big farm house one morning. We were all as excited as usual, especially me. Sitting next to the newly bought cow and talking to him was my daily job during the days before Qurbani. We took special care of him at that time—feeding him more, behaving with extra compassion towards him. I used to put my little hands on his enormous body, talk to him with my other cousins, sometimes feed him. He had beautiful eyes, so black, so deep! Somehow, teardrops always dropped down from his eyes. When I asked my mom about this, she replied, “He knows that the day of sacrifice is coming soon, that’s why!”\r\n\r\nThen the day of Qurbani arrived. The first thing I did that morning was run to see him and talk to him for what would be the last time in my life. Our huzur—the priest—soon came. Around eight people approached, getting ready to help the huzur do his job properly. I was watching everything from far away. The cow seemed to be mourning, making a slight noise; suddenly that slender cry transformed into an overwhelming scream. The sound of it crossed beyond our visual limits, mingling with the unlimited horizon of the unknown. It was probably the loudest scream I ever heard. I couldn’t help but step back. Four men held his legs with great force; another two men held his horns, and the last man caressed his back lovingly. The noises he was making eased now—he seemed to find comfort in those hands. The huzur started to read Dua—prayer—before placing the sharpened knife carefully next to his throat… a stream of blood flowed down, more drops of tears and a moment of silence…\r\n\r\nScully or Doniger or similar animal rights supporters would probably focus on the cruelty of such an event. It does actually seem very cruel if you are an outsider, just reading the description, not realizing the significance and profoundness of the beliefs of the people in the scene. Scully wrote Dominion based on his Christian beliefs and argued for his ideas in the case of animal rights as a devoted Christian; Doniger focused on “compassion” for animals from religious perspectives as well, advising us to take the “wise argument” of South Asian religions—all of which portray the way religious beliefs affected their viewpoints on “the proper way of treating animals.” I would say that the same applies to my case.\r\n\r\nI believe, as the Qur’an says, “It is not their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah: it is your piety that reaches Him…” (Yusuf Ali, Qur’an 22:37). In Islam, it is advised that a large portion of the meat from the animal you sacrifice is distributed among your neighbors, relatives and mostly the poor. It is not only for your own pleasure in eating it. It is a form of charity, a form of showing dedication—not only to Allah but to your fellow human beings. The Qur’an says, “That they may witness the benefits (provided) for them, and celebrate the name of Allah, through the Days appointed, over the cattle which He has provided for them [for sacrifice]: then eat ye thereof and feed the distressed ones in want” (Yusuf Ali, Qur’an 22:28).\r\n\r\nWhat does the animal have to go through to accomplish all this? I would answer this by saying: he has been dedicated for a justifiable reason and has not been treated cruelly in his lifetime, has been slaughtered in the least painful manner—otherwise the meat is Haram—and now has reached the end of his life. After all, death is inevitable for every living being, isn’t it? And moreover, we have more obligation to human beings than to animals, don’t we? I grew up believing this. I am not against vegetarianism but I do believe “compassion” for animals and meat-eating can be combined. Though our first moral obligation as a human being is to care for our own society and for the fellow human beings living in it, this definitely does not mean that we should only utilize other living beings cruelly for our own good. Even as meat-eaters, treating animals humanely, with compassion, kindness, and respect while they are alive or even being slaughtered is our foremost moral obligation.\r\n\r\nEPILOGUE\r\n\r\nNow, this essay would be incomplete if I didn’t dedicate this last paragraph to that great friend of mine—someone who made me realize “the need for compassion,” someone who made me understand that taking life away from a living being is not child’s play—that therefore it must be done with respect; animals too need respect. So—there he lay, dead. I stepped forward towards the blood that made our cream-colored backyard red—the color of both sunrise and sunset. But it was only the color of sunrise for me because I loved him and he had been dedicated for a good reason. I believed it then and I still do now.\r\n\r\nWORK CITED\r\n\r\nAli, Yusuf. “Translations of the Qur’an.” USC-MSA Compendium of Muslim Texts.

Though Doniger does not define the term “compassion” explicitly, she indirectly specifies its meaning as care and kindness throughout the essay. “Buddhists and Jains cared, like Elizabeth Costello, for individual human salvation, more, really, than they cared for animals; they refrained from killing and eating animals to protect their own souls from pollution” (Doniger 98).\r\n\r\nWhile presenting the long-held beliefs of non-Western religions concerning animals, Doniger argues that we should consider some of their wise ideas as well, such as treating animals humanely for human benefits. As she goes on to say, “So, too, whether or not we can argue that killing animals for food or experimentation is bad for the universe, for the food supply…we might take from the South Asian context the very wise argument that we know that they are going to die, and that that makes it bad for us to kill them” (98). This actually seems like a persuasive argument—one that resembles the viewpoint of Matthew Scully, another animal rights advocate and author of the book Dominion. A devoted Christian, Matthew Scully believes that we should treat animals humanely, not because they have rights but because they stand powerless in front of us. Similarly to Doniger, Scully does not emphasize “compassion” for animals—providing animals with rights in this case. However, Scully strongly believes that it is our moral obligation to treat animals humanely. According to him, “We have no duties to the creatures, but only duties in respect of animals” (341). One of his most prominent arguments is that “[a] sin always hurts the sinner more than the victim, estranging the offender from God and risking an eternal fate far worse than any hurt he or she has caused” (348-349). Therefore, Scully argues that we should not subject animals to human cruelty, as “a matter of simple decency and an obligation of justice” (349).\r\n\r\nAND…ISLAM: NEED FOR “COMPASSION”\r\n\r\nThough Doniger looks at “compassion” for animals and vegetarianism from the perspective of some important non-Western religions, she somehow does not mention anything about Islam—a prominent non-Western religion and currently the second-largest world religion. Meat-eating is neither recommended nor forbidden in Islam but for those of us who wish to eat meat, there are some specific rules that we must follow. Making sure that the knife used for slaughter is sharpened so that little pain is inflicted on the animal, not slaughtering animals while they are tied up, and making sure that animals have not been subjected to cruelties during breeding, transporting, or slaughtering are a few of the many requirements for any meat to be Halal. Most of these Islamic laws seem to be based on a sense of “compassion”—kindness, and care for animals. Numerous verses of the Qur’an suggest this idea, including the following one, which gives animals a distinct place along with the humans in the eyes of the Lord: “There is not an animal [that lives] on the earth, nor a being that flies on its wings, but [forms part of] communities like you. Nothing have we omitted from the Book, and they [all] shall be gathered to their Lord in the end” (Yusuf Ali, Qur’an 6:38). Growing up in a conservative Muslim family, my beliefs about “compassion”—kindness, care, respect—and proper treatment of animals, have been derived largely from those views endorsed by my religion, Islam.\r\n\r\nThe basic lesson of both Scully and Doniger’s commendable works is that a deed in this life will pay off soon in the next one; therefore one should think twice before doing a misdeed. Though my views concerning the need to treat animals humanely are quite similar to both of these authors, I would actually take a step forward from Doniger and Scully’s arguments for self-interest in the afterlife and argue for the “need for compassion” for animals in present life. If I care only about my own fate and do not hold any real “compassion” towards animals, then am I really following the words of God—or, rather, fulfilling the responsibility that the Creator has given me in present life for being a moral living being? Scully touches upon this, saying that we fulfill our duties as fathers, husbands, mothers, neighbors, etc.; so why should we not also do it as stewards of the earth, the caretakers of the creation (311-312)? I agree with Scully here. In addition to worrying that ‘what goes around, comes around,’ it is part of our moral obligation or responsibility as humans to develop “compassion” for those other living beings who are sharing the earth with us.\r\n\r\nTHEN WHY MEAT-EATING AND ANIMAL SACRIFICE?\r\n\r\nNow some difficult questions arise. If I hold such strong compassion for animals, then why I am not a vegetarian? If I say that it is our moral obligation to treat animals humanely, then why do I support the sacrifice of animals in the name of God? In Dominion, Scully relates how after writing an article about animal rights and vegetarianism for The National Review, he was amazed by “the volume and indignation of the letters” that came back to him, most of which were from men who talked about how “they liked their meat” and who suggested Scully drop the matter and mind his own business (319). Not surprisingly, Scully was offended by such comments and therefore defends his position in Dominion saying, “What are all these hardy menfolk really defending here? A pleasure. A flavor. A feeling in their bellies” (319). We have to eat meat—Scully castigates this social notion immensely throughout his essay.\r\n\r\nWell, it is true that some people take meat-eating as a pleasure, sometimes not even caring or realizing what the animal has go through to become his dinner. But Scully overlooks the fact that all the fingers in a hand are not the same—not all human beings are the same and not all think the same way. As a meat-eater, I always feel obligated to consider whether the animal has been slaughtered humanely before devouring its meat. It seems like vegetarianism is the only solution Scully supports as a way to treat animals humanely. While reading his arguments, I found myself wondering, can we not combine meat-eating and “compassion” for animals? Is vegetarianism the only way to free animals from the barbaric deeds of humans?\r\n\r\nLet me tell you a story. Eid-Ul-Azha is one of those two Muslim holidays that every year brings happiness and excitement to every Muslim’s life. As a child, I always looked forward to it for many different reasons. One of the most prominent of them was experiencing Qurbani—the process of sacrificing/dedicating animals in the name of Almighty Allah; this is how all meat is derived from animals in Islam.\r\n\r\nOne year, when I was around 7 years old, a soon-to-be sacrificed cow stepped into our big farm house one morning. We were all as excited as usual, especially me. Sitting next to the newly bought cow and talking to him was my daily job during the days before Qurbani. We took special care of him at that time—feeding him more, behaving with extra compassion towards him. I used to put my little hands on his enormous body, talk to him with my other cousins, sometimes feed him. He had beautiful eyes, so black, so deep! Somehow, teardrops always dropped down from his eyes. When I asked my mom about this, she replied, “He knows that the day of sacrifice is coming soon, that’s why!”\r\n\r\nThen the day of Qurbani arrived. The first thing I did that morning was run to see him and talk to him for what would be the last time in my life. Our huzur—the priest—soon came. Around eight people approached, getting ready to help the huzur do his job properly. I was watching everything from far away. The cow seemed to be mourning, making a slight noise; suddenly that slender cry transformed into an overwhelming scream. The sound of it crossed beyond our visual limits, mingling with the unlimited horizon of the unknown. It was probably the loudest scream I ever heard. I couldn’t help but step back. Four men held his legs with great force; another two men held his horns, and the last man caressed his back lovingly. The noises he was making eased now—he seemed to find comfort in those hands. The huzur started to read Dua—prayer—before placing the sharpened knife carefully next to his throat… a stream of blood flowed down, more drops of tears and a moment of silence…\r\n\r\nScully or Doniger or similar animal rights supporters would probably focus on the cruelty of such an event. It does actually seem very cruel if you are an outsider, just reading the description, not realizing the significance and profoundness of the beliefs of the people in the scene. Scully wrote Dominion based on his Christian beliefs and argued for his ideas in the case of animal rights as a devoted Christian; Doniger focused on “compassion” for animals from religious perspectives as well, advising us to take the “wise argument” of South Asian religions—all of which portray the way religious beliefs affected their viewpoints on “the proper way of treating animals.” I would say that the same applies to my case.\r\n\r\nI believe, as the Qur’an says, “It is not their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah: it is your piety that reaches Him…” (Yusuf Ali, Qur’an 22:37). In Islam, it is advised that a large portion of the meat from the animal you sacrifice is distributed among your neighbors, relatives and mostly the poor. It is not only for your own pleasure in eating it. It is a form of charity, a form of showing dedication—not only to Allah but to your fellow human beings. The Qur’an says, “That they may witness the benefits (provided) for them, and celebrate the name of Allah, through the Days appointed, over the cattle which He has provided for them [for sacrifice]: then eat ye thereof and feed the distressed ones in want” (Yusuf Ali, Qur’an 22:28).\r\n\r\nWhat does the animal have to go through to accomplish all this? I would answer this by saying: he has been dedicated for a justifiable reason and has not been treated cruelly in his lifetime, has been slaughtered in the least painful manner—otherwise the meat is Haram—and now has reached the end of his life. After all, death is inevitable for every living being, isn’t it? And moreover, we have more obligation to human beings than to animals, don’t we? I grew up believing this. I am not against vegetarianism but I do believe “compassion” for animals and meat-eating can be combined. Though our first moral obligation as a human being is to care for our own society and for the fellow human beings living in it, this definitely does not mean that we should only utilize other living beings cruelly for our own good. Even as meat-eaters, treating animals humanely, with compassion, kindness, and respect while they are alive or even being slaughtered is our foremost moral obligation.\r\n\r\nEPILOGUE\r\n\r\nNow, this essay would be incomplete if I didn’t dedicate this last paragraph to that great friend of mine—someone who made me realize “the need for compassion,” someone who made me understand that taking life away from a living being is not child’s play—that therefore it must be done with respect; animals too need respect. So—there he lay, dead. I stepped forward towards the blood that made our cream-colored backyard red—the color of both sunrise and sunset. But it was only the color of sunrise for me because I loved him and he had been dedicated for a good reason. I believed it then and I still do now.\r\n\r\nWORK CITED\r\n\r\nAli, Yusuf. “Translations of the Qur’an.” USC-MSA Compendium of Muslim Texts.

(231, 5, '2011-12-17 05:41:33', '2011-12-17 05:41:33', 'Every year that we intend to spend the summer in Pakistan, my mother spends at least two months beforehand assembling gifts for the multitude of people we know there.  She buys chocolates and sneakers for my cousins, perfumes and wristwatches for my uncles, purses for her college friends, sweaters for my grandparents, and often a pair of shoes for Yunis Chacha. “Chacha” means uncle, but while Yunis knows my face and age and predilection for tandoori naan, I don’t call him “ uncle” because he’s related to me by blood: Yunis Chacha is my grandparents’ oldest servant.\r\n\r\nAt first glance, servitude in Pakistan and America seem vastly different, and not only because Pakistani family members are so familiar with their employees.  Almost every practice, from hiring servants to asking them to serve dinner, differs in these two countries.  Yet I feel the same guilt tiptoeing around the workers from the cleaning service my parents hire in suburban Pittsburgh as I do asking Yunis Chacha to make me tea. W hy is this so? Barbara Ehrenreich, author of “Maid to Order,” might be able to help explain my moral distress.  For this article in <em>Harper’s</em>, she spent several months working as a maid for a corporate cleaning service in Maine. Through an exploration of class, gender, subjugation and personal moral development, Ehrenreich raises this question : “As the home becomes a workplace for someone else ” — in Pakistan or America— “is it still a place where you want to live?” (62).\r\nThe middle class Pakistani household is distinct from its American counterpart in many ways. In my grandparents’ home, for example, three employees are almost always present: a watchman for the gate, a cook, and another catch-all employee ( he’s the one sent out for quick errands or the one who sets the table for tea).  A woman comes by every day to do the laundry and clean; the gardener comes by every second or third day.  My parents’ house, situated in a comfortable Pittsburgh suburb, is miles away from Pakistan not only geographically but also atmospherically.  Though my parents are objectively better off than the preceding generation, they cook their own food and make their own beds.  They do, however, hire a landscaping service and a cleaning service—practices that are becoming increasingly popular amongst upper-middle class professionals (Ehrenreich 62).\r\nIt’s true that my family benefits from these workers, but isn’t it true that I benefit from the work of others every single day? I do not weave and stitch my own clothes—nor do I grow or cook much of the food I eat.  As Ehrenreich puts it, “Why should housework, among all the goods and services we consume, arouse any special angst?” (69).  She provides the answer to her own question—housework is different from other products and services “because of its proximity to the activities that compose ‘private’ life” (69).  Furthermore, she claims that having maids in the house can damage one’s moral character.  According to Ehrenreich, having maids teaches children to valorize their own personal worth and time more than that of others (i.e. their parents’ employees).  Because children with maids never have to clean up after themselves, they don’t learn responsibility and therefore “achieve a certain magical weightlessness and immateriality” (70).\r\nThis is the weakest aspect of Ehrenreich’s argument: unlike the rest of her article, in which she bolsters her arguments with empirical observations based on personal experience or statistical data, here she makes a generalized, value-laden statement about a large number of people without citing any sources.  True, some children who grow up in homes with maids might become lazy and inconsiderate individuals, but is that always the case?  I have not found it to be so.  P ersonally, I am morally troubled by hiring others in my home, but not because I don’t always pick up my own socks .  Some of my friends here in college have grown up with maids as well, but they don’t expect fairies to come down and dust their tables—they do it themselves. Hiring maids simply cannot be morally troubling because of the nature or location of the work in question, so something else must be at play.\r\nIn Pakistan, there is no shame in employing servants: virtually all middle class and upper class households have them.  Having not grown up constantly in Pakistani society, when I return, I invariably feel guilty asking Yunis Chacha to make me tea or bring dinner to my room—requests my relatives insist are nothing out of the ordinary.  Yet no matter how many times my aunt patiently explains that we’re actually doing his family a service by hiring him, I cannot come to terms with it.  It is true that the economy in Pakistan is not as stable or as successful as that of America’s.  B ecause of the lack of a good public education system, poor individuals, especially in rural areas, are unable to accrue skills that would enable them to attain middle class jobs in the future.  They then rely on the middle and upper class for employment.  Therefore, being a servant in a home is an important niche in the lower class job spectrum.  If servitude is such a vital part of the economy and way of life, why should I be disgusted with myself when, possessing two healthy legs and knowledge of the house’s layout, I wish to ask Yunis Chacha to get me tea?\r\nBruce Robbins, author of “The Sweatshop Sublime,” helps me to better understand my aunt’s position, but he also broadens my dilemma:\r\n<blockquote>[ D ]isgust with dependence on the work of other people in the home risks passing over into disgust with the dependence on the work of other people in general—a disgust with being a part of a highly elaborate division of labor. Yet learning to be a part of that division is a precondition for almost any progressive politics, nationally and internationally. (92)\r\n\r\nIt makes sense: middle and upper class households in Pakistan, by hiring lower class servants, provide those individuals with jobs.  This interdependence is characteristic of our international system—as American consumers, we rely on Chinese laborers to produce clothes and Mexican immigrants to pick vegetables.  It is unrealistic for us to expect to function without dependence on services, without dependence on the labor of other people.  What difference does it make if workers are sweating away in a field hundreds of miles away or if they’re in the sweatshops that we call home?</blockquote>\r\nIt does make a difference.  In his essay, Robbins recounts Kant’s definition of the sublime, in which there is a “feeling of the inadequacy of the imagination for presenting the ideas of a whole, wherein the imagination reaches its maximum, and, in striving to surpass it, sinks back into itself, by which, however, a kind of emotional satisfaction is produced” ( 85).  Robbins applies this idea within the modern context of globalization and sweatshops.  I n short, there are times in which comfortable, upper middle class individuals feel momentarily guilty about Chinese sweatshop laborers who’ve toiled over their clothing for little to no pay, but this feeling quickly passes.   Upper middle class individuals are satisfied to have at least briefly contemplated the problem, but as they do not interrupt the routine of their daily lives in an attempt to solve it, it has no lasting effect.  This sensation is more difficult to produce when the sweatshop is one’s own home: lacking the luxury of having their laborers separated from them by languages or miles, homeowners hiring maids or employing servants must face the laborers working for them every single day.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is the problem?  If division of labor is an acceptable part of life, then why should an employer feel guilty about bringing workers into her home? In “Maid to Order,” Ehrenreich nails the answer: “Housework was not degrading because it was manual labor… but because it was embedded in degrading relationships and inevitably served to reinforce them” (61).  She is speaking within a feminist context, but gender relations are not the only hierarchies reinforced through household labor. Just as women have been professionally restricted because of their obligation to the bathroom floor and the kitchen table, certain families in Pakistan have been generationally disadvantaged because of their roles as household servants.\r\n\r\nThe Pakistani public education system is absolutely dismal: it yields no opportunities for the already disadvantaged to improve their station.  Graduate and professional schools are only realistic ambitions for children whose parents have attended those types of schools.  Yunis Chacha’s daughter Aliya is an excellent illustration of this point: Yunis has been employed in my grandparents’ home for over forty years, and his daughter, when she was of an able age to work, joined him at his workplace.  Whereas he would cook dinner and brew tea, she would make beds and wash clothes.  Aliya stopped going to school at the age of thirteen to help her parents bring in an income; her children will likely stop going to school at the same age, and for the same reason.  My mother and her siblings, on the other hand, who grew up at the same time as Aliya, all went to private schools, completed graduate school, and went on to lead comparatively affluent and comfortable lives.\r\n\r\nThe guilt I feel when I ask Yunis Chacha to bring me tea is not so much my disgust with division of labor as a whole.  I t is much more complicated than that. It is my recognition that his role as a worker in my house is representative of our respective roles in Pakistani society, which reflects not only our socioeconomic statuses, but also those of our children and grandchildren.  In Pakistan, both wealth and poverty are maintained throughout generations because the barriers to social mobility are staggeringly high.  The guilt is recognition of precisely this: Yunis Chacha probably never chose his line of work, and he and his successive generations are stuck in a rut of servitude, whereas I, daughter of professionals and student at a re nowned university, have myriad opportunities available to me, ripe for the picking.  The problem is not that there is servitude; it is that I will never have to be a servant. I do not feel guilty because I go to an Ivy League school, but because Aliya will never be able to.\r\n\r\nIs American society really so different from the one half a world away?  I would argue—and Ehrenreich might agree—that social mobility in these two countries is more similar than it seems at first glance.  Whereas housework in Pakistan is emblematic of generational poverty, in America housework is representative of the subjugation of women and minorities. Ehrenreich claims that “the association between housecleaning and minority status is well established in the psyches of the white employing class” (63).  This is not without any basis in reality: “One thing you can say with certainty about the population of household workers,” Ehrenreich claims, “is that they are disproportionately women of color: ‘lower’ kinds of people for a ‘lower’ kind of work.  Of the ‘private household cleaners and servants’ it managed to locate in 1998, the Bureau of Labor statistics reports that 36.8 percent were Hispanic, 15.8 percent black, and 2.7 percent ‘other’” (63).  Furthermore, studies conducted by the<em>New York Times</em> for the  recent series “Class Matters” concluded that social mobility in America is not quite as attainable as it seems.  Data from the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s show that people are increasingly remaining in their socioeconomic class: while in the 1970s 35% of people stayed in their class, in the 1990s 40% did (Leonhardt).  Additionally, whereas 27% of families were able to move up or down two quintiles in the 70s, only 21% were able to do so in the 1990s (Leonhardt).  People in America are becoming less able, on average, to change their socioeconomic class.  Since in America race and class often come paired, this means not only that the country experiences generational poverty to an extent that we do not realize, it also means that generational poverty is occurring in a disproportionately high number of minority families.\r\n\r\nRobbins has a point: division of labor is necessary, inside and outside the home, and it is not useful to decry the fact that people outsource the loathsome task of wiping the toilet seat simply because wiping the toilet seat is in and of itself distasteful.  It is simply the case that the world is interdependent and that within this complex system of divided labor there are tasks less desirable than others.  It is not so much a problem that division of labor exists and that within it there is a hierarchy.  T here is a problem in that division of labor <em>maintains</em> a certain hierarchy.  This is the point Ehrenreich recognizes, and addresses well: housework has become symbolic of historic exploitation of gender, class, and race.  In both Pakistan and America, housework is simply the obvious example of a much greater problem.  The solution would be to make social mobility a more feasible reality, especially for the historically disadvantaged. That task is an enormous one, however, too great for the confines of these pages. Hopefully, by furthering discourse on these important topics, we can come to a greater understanding of them and enable ourselves to address them in the future.', 'On Servitude and Division of Labor in Pakistan and America', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'on-servitude-and-division-of-labor-in-pakistan-and-america', '', '', '2012-03-23 15:34:42', '2012-03-23 15:34:42', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=231', 0, 'essay', '', 0);

Cook, <em>African Journal of Reproductive Health</em></blockquote>\r\n<strong>O</strong>n November 1, 2006, in Duluth, Georgia, Khalid Adem was sentenced to ten years in prison and five years’ probation for allegedly circumcising his young daughter with scissors. The court determined that he committed the act in 2001, when his daughter was two years old—though his wife did not report the crime until 2003 (Poole and Feagans). Adem denied responsibility, but his daughter ultimately testified that “my dad cut me on my private part” (Mungin, “‘Dad Cut Me,’ 7-Year-Old Testifies”). An Ethiopian immigrant to the United States, Adem is native to a culture that traditionally practices what is often referred to as “female genital mutilation.” In contrast, his wife’s country of origin, South Africa, does not partake in the tradition (Hansen). This particular difference between the cultural backgrounds of Adem and his wife seems to support the verdict that was eventually reached; it is illogical to think that someone such as Adem’s wife would perform a <em>foreign </em>ritual that is quite so distinct and irrevocable.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, when one considers the Adem trial within the larger context of the debate about female genital cutting (FGC), an element of the case rings false. Even if Adem was justly accused, his daughter’s experience was atypical of those who undergo female circumcision. In Miss Adem’s case, it was her father who enforced and performed the ritual, while in the vast majority of FGC cases, the practice is perpetuated and performed by women. To better understand the larger debate, then, we need to explore the rhetoric of this particular case. Rather than reflecting the reality of the rite, the trial reflected a misinformed model of the tradition in which men are the perpetuators of an institutionalized act of aggression. This discrepancy is significant because it is indicative of a larger issue at play in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe conversation about female circumcision that is unfolding in the West is unfortunately characterized by an almost willful ignorance of the social and cultural structures and beliefs that encourage FGC within the communities that practice it. Genital cutting is undeniably a violent ritual; consequently, it raises questions about the place that certain belief systems have in the globalized world, as well as about the extent to which certain cultural traditions can be reconciled with modern society. Yet in attempting to answer these questions, one is inevitably led to pass judgment on foreign cultures and values. This cannot be reasonably attempted without first establishing a firm sense of the culture surrounding the rite in question. If the United States has in fact chosen to enter the debate on female circumcision (and indeed, because the U.S. outlawed it in 1996, this seems to be the country’s intention), the nation should avoid treating the practice as a gratuitous act of cruelty. It is vital that the United States regard FGC as a product of a nuanced and deeply rooted belief system that merits just as much consideration as the ritual itself.\r\n\r\nFemale genital mutilation is a topic of interest and controversy not only because of what it entails but also because of its prevalence. It is practiced in fourteen African countries, including some in which the tradition has officially been banned. Within these nations, the estimated percentages of women that will be subjected to genital cutting are, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), as high as 90 percent in Ethiopia, 97 percent in Egypt, and 98 percent in Somalia. Between 100 and 140 million women in Africa have been circumcised, and two million women are estimated to be at risk each year (Hansen). Furthermore, FGC has been practiced in Asia, Australia and South America—and, indeed, in the United States (Williams and Sobieszczyk 966).\r\n\r\nIt is crucial to point out, however, that the population of women who undergo FGC is diverse not only in terms of geography, but also in the sense that the women experience a wide range of circumcision practices, all of which are classified by the WHO as “female genital mutilation,” or “FGM.” The most severe and dangerous form of the practice, known as infibulation or Pharaonic circumcision and categorized by the WHO as “FGM Type III,” is probably the one most often imagined when female genital cutting is discussed. Infibulation requires the complete removal of the clitoris, as well as the removal of the inner lips and most of the outer lips of the vagina. What remains of the outer lips is then stitched together, leaving only a tiny hole through which urination, menstruation and intercourse occur—often with great difficulty. Pharaonic circumcision inevitably leads to health problems later in life; infibulated women suffer from chronic urinary tract infections, hemorrhaging, pain during intercourse, and complications during pregnancy (Dreifus). Yet other forms of FGC are prevalent, especially since infibulation has been widely outlawed. The least damaging practice entails a nicking of the clitoris, the only goal being to draw a small amount of blood. The WHO category “FGM Type I” refers to the removal of part or all of the clitoris; this is commonly referred to as <em>sunna</em>, which translates to “tradition” or “duty.”  Finally, between the two extremes of Type I and Type III falls a vast range of “intermediate” practices, all of which are categorized as “FGM Type II,” and many of which are associated with some of the same health risks as Pharaonic circumcision (Williams and Sobieszczyk 967).\r\n\r\nIt is the physical damage associated with female genital cutting that, since the West began to take interest in the tradition in the 1970s, has led outsiders to passionately speak out against the practice. The WHO’s position is that “female genital mutilation is universally unacceptable because it is an infringement on the physical and psychosexual integrity of women and girls and is a form of violence against them” (Bell 130). Yet while an acknowledgment of the violence required by female genital cutting is important to discussion of and opposition to the practice, it is critical that the West come to understand FGC within the context of the culture that perpetuates the custom. As it stands, the West discusses female circumcision in terms of pain, horror, and subjugation. As evident in American commentaries and news articles as well as in the case of Khalid Adem, this representation of the issue amounts to a manipulation of what is at stake.\r\n\r\nThe trial of Khalid Adem is significant in part because it literally brought the issue home to the United States. The case attracted so much attention that a conference on FGC that was originally scheduled to take place in Nairobi, Kenya was moved to Atlanta, the reason being—according to an article in <em>The Atlanta Journal</em><em>-Constitution</em>—that the executive director of the host organization believed the trial created “an incredible opportunity to break the silence about the issue.” She went on to clarify that this silence was an affliction unique to the U.S., calling it “disturbing to see progress in Africa while in this country we’re not prepared to address the issue” (Shoichet). Indeed, many Americans will be surprised to discover that, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 168,000 African women living in the United States have undergone genital cutting (Hansen).\r\n\r\nA consideration of the West’s relationship with female circumcision from a historical perspective reveals the equally unexpected fact of the West’s own employment of the practice. Kirsten Bell, a professor at Macquarie University, says in her article “Genital Cutting and Western Discourses on Sexuality”that “the conceptual separation underlying Western treatments of male and female circumcision is alien to many Africans” (128). Most of the West has gradually made a prominent distinction between male and female circumcision (thus, the term “female circumcision” is often deemed a euphemism). This is not to suggest, however, that the West has not historically revered the latter. According to Bell, masturbation was perceived to be the cause of a number of ailments in the mid- to late-nineteenth century—asthma, epilepsy and rheumatism, to name a few. In turn, clitirodectomies (as well as male circumcision) were considered a successful cure for excessive masturbation. This belief persisted in America and Australia until the late 1960s (Bell 132). Bell asserts that “the history of female circumcision in the West sheds light on the way that changing cultural attitudes … may lead to the continuation or cessation of medical practices” (132). She refers here to the way that changes in Western perceptions of the differences between female and male genitalia have been reflected in the Western medical field, but her observation is also relevant to the potential transformation of practices in contemporary African cultures. A shift in cultural attitudes would likely precede any change in the genital cutting tradition.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the West tends to avoid becoming familiar with the cultural attitudes that are at the heart of FGC. Instead, it focuses on the horror of the physical manifestation of foreign understandings of femininity, purity, and honor. The conversation about FGC is too often reliant upon an oversimplified and superficial packaging of the issue as simply a gender-specific form of abuse. This rendering of it also happens to be the most visually communicable (if not with the use of actual images, then with the use of vivid descriptions), and the most appealing to passion. In her article “Humanitarianism and the Pornography of Pain in Anglo-American Culture,” Karen Halttunen asserts that “eighteenth-century moral philosophers treated sympathy as a sentiment stirred primarily through sight” (305). Ultimately, however, the act of seeing can be replaced by the act of imagining, fueled by stirring accounts of someone else’s suffering. In her article, Halttunen describes a custom that developed in America in the late 1700s and early 1800s in regard to journalistic publications whose purpose was to record and report on murders. She writes, “the popular account of murder became increasingly visual in its treatment of the violence of the crime, offering detailed verbal descriptions… Readers were expressly invited to envision the murder in question, to reconstruct it imaginatively in their mind’s eye, to watch the violence unfold” (312). While it may seem that there was an element of entertainment inherent in these historical accounts that cannot reasonably be pointed to in modern literature on female circumcision, Halttunen’s underlying argument is that all accounts of violence, though on some level necessary to generate sympathy, have the potential to leave people more mesmerized than sympathetic.\r\nThe first sentence of a published personal account of FGC written by a sixteen-year-old Somali girl living in Atlanta launches into a description of her own circumcision. She describes being pinned down and screaming, the “deep, cold look” on her mother’s face, her own bulging eyes, and the “surge of pain through [her] spine [that] sends [her] head back to the floor” (Hussein). Graphic personal accounts are arguably fundamental to raising awareness about FGC, yet in light of the potential that violent narratives have to appeal to readers’ lurid appetites, an effort should be made to place these accounts within a more objective frame.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent that the West’s awareness of this contextual frame is lacking. Tragically, this is evident even in the medical field. The need for doctors with an understanding of the beliefs and traditions that facilitate and perpetuate FCG was so dire in 1999 that a Harvard-trained Sudanese doctor founded a clinic at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Massachusetts specifically devoted to the care of African women. Said one of Dr. Nawal Nour’s patients in a <em>Boston Globe</em> feature about the clinic: “I’ve been trying to get a doctor that will understand the culture and the circumcision problems that I’ve had. I never came across any” (Sege). In an interview conducted for <em>The New York Times</em>, Dr. Nour herself was asked about her patients’ experiences with other American doctors. She responded:\r\n\r\nI understand that female circumcision is a horrible act and I empathize with the horror of the doctor, but what I ask is that a physician not reveal their emotions and thoughts to the patient. For people who haven’t ever dealt with this, the whole thing may be difficult to understand. One can say, “it’s a horrible practice and it needs to be stopped.” But the practice is very different from the patient. The patient may or may not have wanted it herself, or she may be happy with the way her body looks. (Dreifus)\r\nThe last line of Nour’s statement is especially enlightening in that it reveals a complexity often ignored when discussing female genital cutting. There is a focus in the West on the horror of FGC (evident in Nour’s allusion to the doctor’s perspective); furthermore, the West’s understanding of female circumcision is often based on the assumption that genital cutting is always imposed on women against their will. Yet, in the interview, Nour describes her childhood memories of recently circumcised peers basking in the satisfaction of having blossomed into mature women. In a similar vein, Rebecca J. Cook writes in the <em>African Journal of Medical Health </em>that “in a society where there is little economic viability for women outside marriage, ensuring that a daughter undergoes genital mutilation as a child or teenager is a loving act to make certain of her marriageability” (7). Perhaps because it is easier to imagine the issue as the oppression of one group (women and girls) at the hands of another (men), the West generally disregards both the female desire to be circumcised, and the reality that the ritual is organized and performed almost exclusively by women, effectively precluding any practical understanding of the procedure within the male population (Gruenbaum 131-2, 134-6).\r\n\r\nWithin the communities in which female genital cutting is practiced, the tradition is seen as a necessary step in the protection and rearing of one’s daughters. Female circumcision is considered a rite of passage into womanhood; it is what assures the cleanliness and purity of the woman, and it is what defines and signifies her intact and virginal state. Whether or not one finds fault with the belief that a woman is virginal and pure only if her vaginal opening has been made artificially tight and impenetrable, this notion of purity is powerfully ingrained in the collective mind of the male and female communities of the practicing cultures. Anthropologist Ellen Gruenbaum, who has conducted extensive research on FGC in Sudan, writes in her article on the topic that the “altering of less visible parts like the genital area is … reinforced by body aesthetics, even if no one but the person herself usually sees or feels it.” She goes on to describe the “way in which Sudanese women praise the smooth, clean character of the idealized infibulated vulva,” and the fact that “women also express revulsion at the imagined dirty, smelly or wet folds of the open, uninfibulated vulva” (125). Gruenbaum also asserts that certain aspects of FGC, particularly the removal of the clitoris—often considered the female equivalent of the penis—are what “define the child’s sex socially” (126). In practicing communities, many young girls desire to be circumcised for some of the same reasons that American girls seek to acquire Barbie-like proportions—although in the case of circumcision, the perception that the procedure is a prerequisite to marriage and social acceptability is mired in reality (125).\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, it is the women who perpetuate and enforce the tradition of female circumcision. In 1997, Cornell professors Lindy Williams and Teresa Sobieszczyk conducted and published a study on the continuation of FGC in Sudan. Although approximately half of the women they asked said they did not know why genital cutting continued to thrive, 80 percent of them attributed their personal decision to circumcise their own daughters to “custom and tradition,” “the practice [being] a ‘good tradition’” and “cleanliness” (974). Given that the ritual is promoted and performed almost exclusively by female members of society, it is not helpful to the American understanding of FGC that the most well-known U.S. case of female genital cutting involved a clitoridectomy carried out by a man.\r\n\r\nAn article in <em>The Atlanta Journal</em><em>-Constitution </em>written by Lateef Mungin before Khalid Adem was found guilty quoted Adem’s outraged wife: “[My daughter’s] whole life has been changed … She is going to be traumatized psychologically. Parts of her body have been taken away from her without her consent. They need to look at this child the same way they would if she had been raped” (“Rite of Outrage”). In the individual case of her daughter’s experience, Mrs. Adem’s words ring powerfully true—particularly since they come from a woman whose native country does not practice FGC. Indeed, the press represented the story quite accurately. The story itself, however, portrays the larger issue in a way that augments the West’s simplified perception of FGC as a gruesome manifestation of male dominance. For Adem’s trial to have contributed to the West’s superficial understanding of female circumcision is especially dangerous since the well-publicized trial represented mainstream America’s first intimate encounter with the practice.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the tactics taken on by the prosecution and defense at Adem’s trial seems to support the hypothesis that the West lacks knowledge about the culture surrounding FGC. Mungin covered the trial quite thoroughly in his articles. Ultimately, it was the seven-year-old girl who ensured the conviction of her father. The prosecutor’s argument hung on her brief testimony, and on a series of nightmares in which she had allegedly screamed “No, Daddy. No.” The prosecutor claimed, “She was basically saying her dad was a monster in her dreams. But it is not a dream. He did it in real life” (Mungin, “Mutilation Case Goes to the Jury”). The defense, meanwhile, argued that there was no way Adem would have been able to hide the damage of the procedure from his wife, thus concluding that the mother must have been responsible. Guilt and responsibility aside, it is worth noting that the jury was ultimately unmoved by the defense’s suggestion of maternal neglect, despite the defense’s directed questioning: “Now moms, how in the world would you not know that your daughter had been circumcised—for a year and four months?” (Mungin, “Mutilation Case Goes to the Jury”). Might this reflect the common assumption that genital cutting always victimizes women?\r\n\r\nGiven that Adem’s wife was South African and therefore less likely than he was to adhere to the custom of female circumcision, Adem’s conviction was probably just. Still, as far as the United States is concerned, the trial introduced a new element to the issue of FGC. The debate is no longer academic and abstract; it is undeniably an issue in our own communities. On some level, this new dimension of the issue gives one the impression that the United States can now divorce the physical act of violence from its cultural context. One might argue that because neither the ritual nor the values associated with it are traditionally American, the United States has no obligation to consider the significance of the belief system that supports the tradition. This, however, is a flawed judgment of the situation. Criminalizing parents who circumcise their daughters, for instance, has—according to an article by Catherine E. Shoichet in <em>The Atlanta Journal</em><em>-Constitution</em>—merely driven the practice underground, while the cultural values that feed it continue to flourish. The outlawing of FCG in the U.S. has done little to facilitate a dialogue about the cultures that see beauty and necessity in the tradition. This dialogue must take place. If the United States intends to approach the issue in a productive manner, it must cease to distort and trivialize the cultural significance of the practice.', 'Overlooking the Rite in the Name of What’s “Right”: The West and Its Perceptions of Female Genital Cutting ', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'overlooking-the-rite-in-the-name-of-what%e2%80%99s-%e2%80%9cright%e2%80%9d-the-west-and-its-perceptions-of-female-genital-cutting', '', '', '2012-03-23 15:37:59', '2012-03-23 15:37:59', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?p=31', 0, 'essay', '', 0),

(221, 5, '2011-12-17 05:20:44', '2011-12-17 05:20:44', 'Amidst the packed throngs of Tokyo, tucked away from the hum of traffic and commerce, sits the Yasukuni Shrine, a token of a bygone era and a bygone Japan holding firm against the beating stream of time. Upon entering the shrine’s sprawling grounds, one can almost feel an aura of floating stillness seeping into the marrow of his or her bones, so calm and orderly are the grounds, so gentle the curves of the buildings. At the heart of this dreamscape lies the <em>honden</em>, the main structure of the shrine complex. The <em>honden</em> instills a sense of transcendence in its viewers, drawing gazes upwards to the curving skyline of a heavy and intricate roof, deep brown meshing with foam blue and looming over the space below it. This space below, the body of the <em>honden</em>, sinks inwards from the arms of the roof, a hobbling collection of thin, vertical wooden beams with white, paper-thin walls stretched between them—a structure seemingly too frail to support the behemoth structure dominating the skies. Yet somehow this emaciated body does lift its roof into the air, breathtaking in its enlightened breach of reason. It is in this <em>honden</em>that the shrine’s <em>kami</em> are stored, nearly two and a half million spirits, all of them enshrined and eternally revered for their service to the now all-but-nonexistent emperor of Japan. One expects such a breathtaking historic landmark to receive a few visitors. The Yasukuni shrine’s visitors, however, do not treat the shrine as they would any other guidebook stop. They treat the anachronistic shrine with a special reverence and devotion, and one cannot help but wonder why.\r\n\r\nAs suggested by the statues sprinkling the shrine’s grounds, such as those to the Meiji era warrior Ōmura Masujirō, a kamikaze pilot, and a war widow, spiritual enshrinement was granted for military service—a reflection of the age in which the shrine itself was built. The Meiji era (here referring to the 1868—1945 era of Japanese imperialism initiated by Emperor Meiji) shifted Japan from a feudal and isolated nation to one avidly participating within the global trade network. Shockingly, the formerly isolationist and only lightly unified Japanese people took to this new life with great zeal, which was epitomized in the nationalizing and imperializing reforms of Emperor Meiji. Under his leadership, Japan thrust itself into a modernizing effort more swiftly than any other nation, adjusting to industrial life and international relations by developing an undying admiration for and devotion to a deified emperor. The army served Meiji with unbending willpower, discipline and loyalty in order to put down internal rebellion, reinforce the values of the new era, and claim territory. Out of respect for such virtuous actions, the emperor began construction of the shrine at the end of his revolutionary climb to power in 1869. The shrine would grant state Shinto priests an ideal compound in which to pay homage to the dead, and in which the people of Japan could come to view the image of service and its eternal rewards of glory and bliss. It was in this shrine that Emperor Meiji first embodied the values of the new Japan, the land of a newly united and purely Japanese people, no longer divided by clan, but centered around a common self-image, a common historical birthday, a common father in the emperor.\r\n\r\nThis way of life, though, came to an end in 1945 with the United States’ invasion of Japan and the imposition of a new, American-style constitution upon the Japanese people. The constitution stripped the Japanese people of their Meiji values. The emperor was depoliticized, relegated to a figurehead role. The military, the hub of imperialism and loyalty, was stripped down to an impotent “defense force.” The separation of church and state prevented Shintos’ involvement with political life. Finally, the Yasukuni Shrine, home to spiritual life, was forced to end its relations with the state; it became fully religious and therefore almost taboo for the secular government. Thus the shrine was removed from the flow of time as Japanese society became rapidly more commercial and peaceful, more secular and individual, leaving the values of unbending service and honor to the past. Perplexingly, though, this shrine, an esoteric piece of cultural history, historically revisionist and controversially populated by the spirits of convicted war criminals, remains one of the most visited and popular memorials in Japan.\r\n\r\nAstoundingly, what one may call “the Yasukuni syndrome”—the flocking of people to a seemingly obsolete memorial—is not an uncommon occurrence; the shrine merely offers an example of this conundrum for analysis. In an attempt to reason out this puzzle, the concepts of Marianne Hirsch and Leo Spitzer’s essay “‘We Would Not Have Come Without You’: Generations of Nostalgia,” serve to explain, in part, the compulsion of the Japanese people, from layman, to Shinto practitioner, to the prime minister, to visit a shrine commemorating dead they have little or no relation to and wars falling into the realms of distant history.\r\n\r\nHirsch and Spitzer’s work addresses the nostalgic longing for a lost home in exiled Holocaust survivors and their children. They note that even those children who know nothing of the lost home from personal experience feel nostalgic yearning. Hirsch and Spitzer’s analytic journey provides explanations for this yearning without acquaintance, and a cure for yearning in returning to the lost home. This account gives a basis by which one may diagnose the Japanese as suffering from a collective and specific case of nostalgia (and then seek a cure).\r\n\r\nThough modern Japanese people are far removed from the events of the Meiji era and its values, they possess what Hirsch and Spitzer call a “postmemory” of the time. Such postmemory refers to “a mediated relation to (in Stefan Zweig’s phrase) a lost ‘world of yesterday’ that [descendants have] inherited from parents and grandparents …,” who had grown up indoctrinated with the values of the Meiji and the fresh memories of imperial collapse (256). This postmemory, though, is dissimilar to the postmemories inherited by most societies as Japan’s history broke sharply at 1945. Overnight, their values were overthrown by a foreign constitution limiting the ways in which they could relate to their state, religion, and society. This sudden shift in socio-political interactions caused a historical rupture, which jerked the nation into the future with no bridge to the past.\r\n\r\nHence, the Japanese people become exiles in time, suffering from what Hirsch and Spitzer specifically call “resistant nostalgia,” in that they suffer “longing inherent in all nostalgic constrictions ‘for a home that no longer exists or has never existed,” and then, having no reference to the actual past but, “…inherited shards of memory,” the unknown home becomes “valued as somehow better, simpler, less fragmented, and more comprehensible than its alternative in the present,” through a clash of the old and new ideas (which arose from nothing, with no sense of history or value) (256, 258, 263). Furthermore as resistant nostalgia—and all nostalgia—may be, “triggered in its victims through sights, sounds, smells, tastes—any number of associations that might influence them to recall the homes and environments they had unwillingly left behind,” (258) the daily contact with physical Meiji cultural remains may cause perpetual nostalgia, hence perpetual memory/identity crises, in many modern Japanese citizens. This constant pressure increases the urge for release.\r\n\r\nThe common knowledge about nostalgia, resistant or otherwise, Hirsch and Spitzer claim, is that, “returning the ‘homesick,’ the ‘nostalgic,’ to their origins,” leads to, “its [nostalgia’s] restorative ending,” in that it bridges memory, postmemory and perception, fusing the painful nostalgic fracture (258). With this cure in mind, the Japanese come to the Yasukuni Shrine seeking not to memorialize the dead, but momentarily to inhabit a lost temporal home. They want the shrine’s museum to tell the spirits’ stories and grant truth and humanity to postmemory. Viewing the stories of the past and witnessing lost traditions carried out by the Shinto priests allow the visitor, “[…] to bear witness to and participate in their transitory acts of memory, acts that [allow] – for some moments, at least – conflicting recollections to coalesce,” reconciling the conflicting relationship of the known “now” and the postmemory’s “then,” and sealing up resistant nostalgia’s painful gashes within the modern Japanese citizen (Hirsch and Spitzer 263). However, this relief proves fleeting for Japanese visitors who return regularly in the same state of confusion, whereas Hirsch and Spitzer’s memory rifts were healed at Czernowitz. Some integral difference, then, makes Czernowitz a cure to an ailment and the Yasukuni shrine merely a treatment of a symptom. The difference may arise from the approach to personal connection and fact within the structures, a different number of people suffering from varied postmemory types, or some blend of these complications.\r\n\r\nThe trip to the Yasukuni shrine is typically a lonely pilgrimage. Whereas Hirsch and Spitzer, at Czernowitz with their parents, “finally internalized …the reality of what we now euphemistically refer to as ethnic cleansing,” the Japanese come to the Yasukuni Shrine alone, unaided by personal connections to the Meiji era (271). Thus they often end up reinforcing their own distant conceptions of Meiji values, reaching no real consensus with the past but instead a stylized mental recreation. In this way, they internalize no fact or truth, but only further idealize the past, especially through the revisionist history prevalent in the exhibits and rituals of the shrine—the closest experience to personal contact there. Without such a personal component to the trip, such as the parents of Hirsch and Spitzer, or of a living link to check the “narratives … generated when the present intrudes upon the past,” the Japanese tend to deify their ancestors’ memories and further fracture their own worldviews (Hirsch and Spitzer 257). The museum uses the pretense of authentic connection to voices of the past to promote a utopian view of the Meiji era and reinforce, not reconcile, resistant nostalgia by historical revisionism. Voiceless, the limited path between “then” and “now” crumbles; visitors jolt back from the old world to the present day, but no bridge supports their rapid transition and so they succumb to resistant nostalgia once more.\r\n\r\nHirsch and Spitzer’s journey to their bridge between past and present was that of one family to one personalized location. Czernowitz held a special application to their story alone. The magnitude of those suffering from postmemory (and hence resistant nostalgia) in Japan, though, defies this approach. The core postmemories of the Japanese are much vaguer than the postmemories of the Hirsch family, which allows more room for individual modification. Family ties, upbringing, or personal inclination will slightly alter the broad cultural postmemory into a personal variant within each sufferer. Each, then, requires a separate resolution and one shrine, however artfully crafted or layered, cannot hope to appeal to the needs of several million variations upon a core postmemory. This would be similar to claiming that all Holocaust survivors’ children should visit Czernowitz alone as the ultimate restorative ground. Thus, the sheer number of souls touched by a vague, cultural postmemory—each slightly altering it through their modern, personal lenses—cannot be served by the intent or story of one shrine. As Czernowitz limits its restorative scope to a fraction of Holocaust survivors (possibly only the Hirsch family), so the Yasukuni shrine may only serve a fraction of Japanese people.\r\n\r\nWhile the views of Hirsch and Spitzer provide insight into motivation for visitations to the Yasukuni Shrine, they do not lead to the same, sure resolution as Hirsch and Spitzer’s visitation to Czernowitz. Though useful in assessing modern Japanese cultural identity, the concept of a core cultural postmemory leading to a single, curable resistant nostalgia does not do justice to the individualized postmemories of each Japanese citizen. While postmemory is certainly at play in the social discontent of the Japanese, the idea that visiting one shrine may resolve the resistant nostalgia of every Japanese visitor proves absurd. The absurdity of the claim does not diminish the draw of the shrine, though. The basic collective postmemories and nostalgic yearnings may lead to an overall collective view of the situation. Thus, seeing a cure for one sufferer incites a belief in a universal cure. So the one sufferer went to the Yasukuni Shrine and found peace and so now they all flock there, hoping that a generalized remedy may cure their individual cases. Ironically, this readiness to accept and promote unity is a Meiji ideal, and embracing it only furthers temporal resistant nostalgia’s effects. In this light, the purported cure, the Yasukuni Shrine, may only serve to further damage their personal reconciliation of “then” and “now.” v\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'A False Hope: The Historical Exiles’ Refuge', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'a-false-hope-the-historical-exiles-refuge', '', '', '2012-04-10 15:39:13', '2012-04-10 15:39:13', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=221', 0, 'essay', '', 0);

Cook, <em>African Journal of Reproductive Health</em></blockquote>\n<strong>O</strong>n November 1, 2006, in Duluth, Georgia, Khalid Adem was sentenced to ten years in prison and five years’ probation for allegedly circumcising his young daughter with scissors. The court determined that he committed the act in 2001, when his daughter was two years old—though his wife did not report the crime until 2003 (Poole and Feagans). Adem denied responsibility, but his daughter ultimately testified that “my dad cut me on my private part” (Mungin, “‘Dad Cut Me,’ 7-Year-Old Testifies”). An Ethiopian immigrant to the United States, Adem is native to a culture that traditionally practices what is often referred to as “female genital mutilation.” In contrast, his wife’s country of origin, South Africa, does not partake in the tradition (Hansen). This particular difference between the cultural backgrounds of Adem and his wife seems to support the verdict that was eventually reached; it is illogical to think that someone such as Adem’s wife would perform a <em>foreign </em>ritual that is quite so distinct and irrevocable.\n\nNevertheless, when one considers the Adem trial within the larger context of the debate about female genital cutting (FGC), an element of the case rings false. Even if Adem was justly accused, his daughter’s experience was atypical of those who undergo female circumcision. In Miss Adem’s case, it was her father who enforced and performed the ritual, while in the vast majority of FGC cases, the practice is perpetuated and performed by women. To better understand the larger debate, then, we need to explore the rhetoric of this particular case. Rather than reflecting the reality of the rite, the trial reflected a misinformed model of the tradition in which men are the perpetuators of an institutionalized act of aggression. This discrepancy is significant because it is indicative of a larger issue at play in the United States.\n\nThe conversation about female circumcision that is unfolding in the West is unfortunately characterized by an almost willful ignorance of the social and cultural structures and beliefs that encourage FGC within the communities that practice it. Genital cutting is undeniably a violent ritual; consequently, it raises questions about the place that certain belief systems have in the globalized world, as well as about the extent to which certain cultural traditions can be reconciled with modern society. Yet in attempting to answer these questions, one is inevitably led to pass judgment on foreign cultures and values. This cannot be reasonably attempted without first establishing a firm sense of the culture surrounding the rite in question. If the United States has in fact chosen to enter the debate on female circumcision (and indeed, because the U.S. outlawed it in 1996, this seems to be the country’s intention), the nation should avoid treating the practice as a gratuitous act of cruelty. It is vital that the United States regard FGC as a product of a nuanced and deeply rooted belief system that merits just as much consideration as the ritual itself.\n\nFemale genital mutilation is a topic of interest and controversy not only because of what it entails but also because of its prevalence. It is practiced in fourteen African countries, including some in which the tradition has officially been banned. Within these nations, the estimated percentages of women that will be subjected to genital cutting are, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), as high as 90 percent in Ethiopia, 97 percent in Egypt, and 98 percent in Somalia. Between 100 and 140 million women in Africa have been circumcised, and two million women are estimated to be at risk each year (Hansen). Furthermore, FGC has been practiced in Asia, Australia and South America—and, indeed, in the United States (Williams and Sobieszczyk 966).\n\nIt is crucial to point out, however, that the population of women who undergo FGC is diverse not only in terms of geography, but also in the sense that the women experience a wide range of circumcision practices, all of which are classified by the WHO as “female genital mutilation,” or “FGM.” The most severe and dangerous form of the practice, known as infibulation or Pharaonic circumcision and categorized by the WHO as “FGM Type III,” is probably the one most often imagined when female genital cutting is discussed. Infibulation requires the complete removal of the clitoris, as well as the removal of the inner lips and most of the outer lips of the vagina. What remains of the outer lips is then stitched together, leaving only a tiny hole through which urination, menstruation and intercourse occur—often with great difficulty. Pharaonic circumcision inevitably leads to health problems later in life; infibulated women suffer from chronic urinary tract infections, hemorrhaging, pain during intercourse, and complications during pregnancy (Dreifus). Yet other forms of FGC are prevalent, especially since infibulation has been widely outlawed. The least damaging practice entails a nicking of the clitoris, the only goal being to draw a small amount of blood. The WHO category “FGM Type I” refers to the removal of part or all of the clitoris; this is commonly referred to as <em>sunna</em>, which translates to “tradition” or “duty.”  Finally, between the two extremes of Type I and Type III falls a vast range of “intermediate” practices, all of which are categorized as “FGM Type II,” and many of which are associated with some of the same health risks as Pharaonic circumcision (Williams and Sobieszczyk 967).\n\nIt is the physical damage associated with female genital cutting that, since the West began to take interest in the tradition in the 1970s, has led outsiders to passionately speak out against the practice. The WHO’s position is that “female genital mutilation is universally unacceptable because it is an infringement on the physical and psychosexual integrity of women and girls and is a form of violence against them” (Bell 130). Yet while an acknowledgment of the violence required by female genital cutting is important to discussion of and opposition to the practice, it is critical that the West come to understand FGC within the context of the culture that perpetuates the custom. As it stands, the West discusses female circumcision in terms of pain, horror, and subjugation. As evident in American commentaries and news articles as well as in the case of Khalid Adem, this representation of the issue amounts to a manipulation of what is at stake.\n\nThe trial of Khalid Adem is significant in part because it literally brought the issue home to the United States. The case attracted so much attention that a conference on FGC that was originally scheduled to take place in Nairobi, Kenya was moved to Atlanta, the reason being—according to an article in <em>The Atlanta Journal</em><em>-Constitution</em>—that the executive director of the host organization believed the trial created “an incredible opportunity to break the silence about the issue.” She went on to clarify that this silence was an affliction unique to the U.S., calling it “disturbing to see progress in Africa while in this country we’re not prepared to address the issue” (Shoichet). Indeed, many Americans will be surprised to discover that, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 168,000 African women living in the United States have undergone genital cutting (Hansen).\n\nA consideration of the West’s relationship with female circumcision from a historical perspective reveals the equally unexpected fact of the West’s own employment of the practice. Kirsten Bell, a professor at Macquarie University, says in her article “Genital Cutting and Western Discourses on Sexuality”that “the conceptual separation underlying Western treatments of male and female circumcision is alien to many Africans” (128). Most of the West has gradually made a prominent distinction between male and female circumcision (thus, the term “female circumcision” is often deemed a euphemism). This is not to suggest, however, that the West has not historically revered the latter. According to Bell, masturbation was perceived to be the cause of a number of ailments in the mid- to late-nineteenth century—asthma, epilepsy and rheumatism, to name a few. In turn, clitirodectomies (as well as male circumcision) were considered a successful cure for excessive masturbation. This belief persisted in America and Australia until the late 1960s (Bell 132). Bell asserts that “the history of female circumcision in the West sheds light on the way that changing cultural attitudes … may lead to the continuation or cessation of medical practices” (132). She refers here to the way that changes in Western perceptions of the differences between female and male genitalia have been reflected in the Western medical field, but her observation is also relevant to the potential transformation of practices in contemporary African cultures. A shift in cultural attitudes would likely precede any change in the genital cutting tradition.\n\nUnfortunately, the West tends to avoid becoming familiar with the cultural attitudes that are at the heart of FGC. Instead, it focuses on the horror of the physical manifestation of foreign understandings of femininity, purity, and honor. The conversation about FGC is too often reliant upon an oversimplified and superficial packaging of the issue as simply a gender-specific form of abuse. This rendering of it also happens to be the most visually communicable (if not with the use of actual images, then with the use of vivid descriptions), and the most appealing to passion. In her article “Humanitarianism and the Pornography of Pain in Anglo-American Culture,” Karen Halttunen asserts that “eighteenth-century moral philosophers treated sympathy as a sentiment stirred primarily through sight” (305). Ultimately, however, the act of seeing can be replaced by the act of imagining, fueled by stirring accounts of someone else’s suffering. In her article, Halttunen describes a custom that developed in America in the late 1700s and early 1800s in regard to journalistic publications whose purpose was to record and report on murders. She writes, “the popular account of murder became increasingly visual in its treatment of the violence of the crime, offering detailed verbal descriptions… Readers were expressly invited to envision the murder in question, to reconstruct it imaginatively in their mind’s eye, to watch the violence unfold” (312). While it may seem that there was an element of entertainment inherent in these historical accounts that cannot reasonably be pointed to in modern literature on female circumcision, Halttunen’s underlying argument is that all accounts of violence, though on some level necessary to generate sympathy, have the potential to leave people more mesmerized than sympathetic.\nThe first sentence of a published personal account of FGC written by a sixteen-year-old Somali girl living in Atlanta launches into a description of her own circumcision. She describes being pinned down and screaming, the “deep, cold look” on her mother’s face, her own bulging eyes, and the “surge of pain through [her] spine [that] sends [her] head back to the floor” (Hussein). Graphic personal accounts are arguably fundamental to raising awareness about FGC, yet in light of the potential that violent narratives have to appeal to readers’ lurid appetites, an effort should be made to place these accounts within a more objective frame.\n\nIt is apparent that the West’s awareness of this contextual frame is lacking. Tragically, this is evident even in the medical field. The need for doctors with an understanding of the beliefs and traditions that facilitate and perpetuate FCG was so dire in 1999 that a Harvard-trained Sudanese doctor founded a clinic at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Massachusetts specifically devoted to the care of African women. Said one of Dr. Nawal Nour’s patients in a <em>Boston Globe</em> feature about the clinic: “I’ve been trying to get a doctor that will understand the culture and the circumcision problems that I’ve had. I never came across any” (Sege). In an interview conducted for <em>The New York Times</em>, Dr. Nour herself was asked about her patients’ experiences with other American doctors. She responded:\n\nI understand that female circumcision is a horrible act and I empathize with the horror of the doctor, but what I ask is that a physician not reveal their emotions and thoughts to the patient. For people who haven’t ever dealt with this, the whole thing may be difficult to understand. One can say, “it’s a horrible practice and it needs to be stopped.” But the practice is very different from the patient. The patient may or may not have wanted it herself, or she may be happy with the way her body looks. (Dreifus)\nThe last line of Nour’s statement is especially enlightening in that it reveals a complexity often ignored when discussing female genital cutting. There is a focus in the West on the horror of FGC (evident in Nour’s allusion to the doctor’s perspective); furthermore, the West’s understanding of female circumcision is often based on the assumption that genital cutting is always imposed on women against their will. Yet, in the interview, Nour describes her childhood memories of recently circumcised peers basking in the satisfaction of having blossomed into mature women. In a similar vein, Rebecca J. Cook writes in the <em>African Journal of Medical Health </em>that “in a society where there is little economic viability for women outside marriage, ensuring that a daughter undergoes genital mutilation as a child or teenager is a loving act to make certain of her marriageability” (7). Perhaps because it is easier to imagine the issue as the oppression of one group (women and girls) at the hands of another (men), the West generally disregards both the female desire to be circumcised, and the reality that the ritual is organized and performed almost exclusively by women, effectively precluding any practical understanding of the procedure within the male population (Gruenbaum 131-2, 134-6).\n\nWithin the communities in which female genital cutting is practiced, the tradition is seen as a necessary step in the protection and rearing of one’s daughters. Female circumcision is considered a rite of passage into womanhood; it is what assures the cleanliness and purity of the woman, and it is what defines and signifies her intact and virginal state. Whether or not one finds fault with the belief that a woman is virginal and pure only if her vaginal opening has been made artificially tight and impenetrable, this notion of purity is powerfully ingrained in the collective mind of the male and female communities of the practicing cultures. Anthropologist Ellen Gruenbaum, who has conducted extensive research on FGC in Sudan, writes in her article on the topic that the “altering of less visible parts like the genital area is … reinforced by body aesthetics, even if no one but the person herself usually sees or feels it.” She goes on to describe the “way in which Sudanese women praise the smooth, clean character of the idealized infibulated vulva,” and the fact that “women also express revulsion at the imagined dirty, smelly or wet folds of the open, uninfibulated vulva” (125). Gruenbaum also asserts that certain aspects of FGC, particularly the removal of the clitoris—often considered the female equivalent of the penis—are what “define the child’s sex socially” (126). In practicing communities, many young girls desire to be circumcised for some of the same reasons that American girls seek to acquire Barbie-like proportions—although in the case of circumcision, the perception that the procedure is a prerequisite to marriage and social acceptability is mired in reality (125).\n\nGenerally speaking, it is the women who perpetuate and enforce the tradition of female circumcision. In 1997, Cornell professors Lindy Williams and Teresa Sobieszczyk conducted and published a study on the continuation of FGC in Sudan. Although approximately half of the women they asked said they did not know why genital cutting continued to thrive, 80 percent of them attributed their personal decision to circumcise their own daughters to “custom and tradition,” “the practice [being] a ‘good tradition’” and “cleanliness” (974). Given that the ritual is promoted and performed almost exclusively by female members of society, it is not helpful to the American understanding of FGC that the most well-known U.S. case of female genital cutting involved a clitoridectomy carried out by a man.\n\nAn article in <em>The Atlanta Journal</em><em>-Constitution </em>written by Lateef Mungin before Khalid Adem was found guilty quoted Adem’s outraged wife: “[My daughter’s] whole life has been changed … She is going to be traumatized psychologically. Parts of her body have been taken away from her without her consent. They need to look at this child the same way they would if she had been raped” (“Rite of Outrage”). In the individual case of her daughter’s experience, Mrs. Adem’s words ring powerfully true—particularly since they come from a woman whose native country does not practice FGC. Indeed, the press represented the story quite accurately. The story itself, however, portrays the larger issue in a way that augments the West’s simplified perception of FGC as a gruesome manifestation of male dominance. For Adem’s trial to have contributed to the West’s superficial understanding of female circumcision is especially dangerous since the well-publicized trial represented mainstream America’s first intimate encounter with the practice.\n\nAn examination of the tactics taken on by the prosecution and defense at Adem’s trial seems to support the hypothesis that the West lacks knowledge about the culture surrounding FGC. Mungin covered the trial quite thoroughly in his articles. Ultimately, it was the seven-year-old girl who ensured the conviction of her father. The prosecutor’s argument hung on her brief testimony, and on a series of nightmares in which she had allegedly screamed “No, Daddy. No.” The prosecutor claimed, “She was basically saying her dad was a monster in her dreams. But it is not a dream. He did it in real life” (Mungin, “Mutilation Case Goes to the Jury”). The defense, meanwhile, argued that there was no way Adem would have been able to hide the damage of the procedure from his wife, thus concluding that the mother must have been responsible. Guilt and responsibility aside, it is worth noting that the jury was ultimately unmoved by the defense’s suggestion of maternal neglect, despite the defense’s directed questioning: “Now moms, how in the world would you not know that your daughter had been circumcised—for a year and four months?” (Mungin, “Mutilation Case Goes to the Jury”). Might this reflect the common assumption that genital cutting always victimizes women?\n\nGiven that Adem’s wife was South African and therefore less likely than he was to adhere to the custom of female circumcision, Adem’s conviction was probably just. Still, as far as the United States is concerned, the trial introduced a new element to the issue of FGC. The debate is no longer academic and abstract; it is undeniably an issue in our own communities. On some level, this new dimension of the issue gives one the impression that the United States can now divorce the physical act of violence from its cultural context. One might argue that because neither the ritual nor the values associated with it are traditionally American, the United States has no obligation to consider the significance of the belief system that supports the tradition. This, however, is a flawed judgment of the situation. Criminalizing parents who circumcise their daughters, for instance, has—according to an article by Catherine E. Shoichet in <em>The Atlanta Journal</em><em>-Constitution</em>—merely driven the practice underground, while the cultural values that feed it continue to flourish. The outlawing of FCG in the U.S. has done little to facilitate a dialogue about the cultures that see beauty and necessity in the tradition. This dialogue must take place. If the United States intends to approach the issue in a productive manner, it must cease to distort and trivialize the cultural significance of the practice.', 'Overlooking the Rite in the Name of What’s “Right”: The West and Its Perceptions of Female Genital Cutting ', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '31-autosave', '', '', '2012-03-23 15:35:55', '2012-03-23 15:35:55', '', 31, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?p=33', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

CROOKE\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA name commonly applied, including by the [World Health Organization] itself, is “female genital mutilation” but this description may be ethically inappropriate … Evaluatively, the name is not a neutral description but a severely hostile judgment, since it condemns those who seek, authorize and perform such cutting as mutilators of human beings.\r\n—Rebecca J. Cook, <em>African Journal of Reproductive Health</em>\r\n<strong>O</strong>n November 1, 2006, in Duluth, Georgia, Khalid Adem was sentenced to ten years in prison and five years’ probation for allegedly circumcising his young daughter with scissors. The court determined that he committed the act in 2001, when his daughter was two years old—though his wife did not report the crime until 2003 (Poole and Feagans). Adem denied responsibility, but his daughter ultimately testified that “my dad cut me on my private part” (Mungin, “‘Dad Cut Me,’ 7-Year-Old Testifies”). An Ethiopian immigrant to the United States, Adem is native to a culture that traditionally practices what is often referred to as “female genital mutilation.” In contrast, his wife’s country of origin, South Africa, does not partake in the tradition (Hansen). This particular difference between the cultural backgrounds of Adem and his wife seems to support the verdict that was eventually reached; it is illogical to think that someone such as Adem’s wife would perform a <em>foreign </em>ritual that is quite so distinct and irrevocable.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, when one considers the Adem trial within the larger context of the debate about female genital cutting (FGC), an element of the case rings false. Even if Adem was justly accused, his daughter’s experience was atypical of those who undergo female circumcision. In Miss Adem’s case, it was her father who enforced and performed the ritual, while in the vast majority of FGC cases, the practice is perpetuated and performed by women. To better understand the larger debate, then, we need to explore the rhetoric of this particular case. Rather than reflecting the reality of the rite, the trial reflected a misinformed model of the tradition in which men are the perpetuators of an institutionalized act of aggression. This discrepancy is significant because it is indicative of a larger issue at play in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe conversation about female circumcision that is unfolding in the West is unfortunately characterized by an almost willful ignorance of the social and cultural structures and beliefs that encourage FGC within the communities that practice it. Genital cutting is undeniably a violent ritual; consequently, it raises questions about the place that certain belief systems have in the globalized world, as well as about the extent to which certain cultural traditions can be reconciled with modern society. Yet in attempting to answer these questions, one is inevitably led to pass judgment on foreign cultures and values. This cannot be reasonably attempted without first establishing a firm sense of the culture surrounding the rite in question. If the United States has in fact chosen to enter the debate on female circumcision (and indeed, because the U.S. outlawed it in 1996, this seems to be the country’s intention), the nation should avoid treating the practice as a gratuitous act of cruelty. It is vital that the United States regard FGC as a product of a nuanced and deeply rooted belief system that merits just as much consideration as the ritual itself.\r\n\r\nFemale genital mutilation is a topic of interest and controversy not only because of what it entails but also because of its prevalence. It is practiced in fourteen African countries, including some in which the tradition has officially been banned. Within these nations, the estimated percentages of women that will be subjected to genital cutting are, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), as high as 90 percent in Ethiopia, 97 percent in Egypt, and 98 percent in Somalia. Between 100 and 140 million women in Africa have been circumcised, and two million women are estimated to be at risk each year (Hansen). Furthermore, FGC has been practiced in Asia, Australia and South America—and, indeed, in the United States (Williams and Sobieszczyk 966).\r\n\r\nIt is crucial to point out, however, that the population of women who undergo FGC is diverse not only in terms of geography, but also in the sense that the women experience a wide range of circumcision practices, all of which are classified by the WHO as “female genital mutilation,” or “FGM.” The most severe and dangerous form of the practice, known as infibulation or Pharaonic circumcision and categorized by the WHO as “FGM Type III,” is probably the one most often imagined when female genital cutting is discussed. Infibulation requires the complete removal of the clitoris, as well as the removal of the inner lips and most of the outer lips of the vagina. What remains of the outer lips is then stitched together, leaving only a tiny hole through which urination, menstruation and intercourse occur—often with great difficulty. Pharaonic circumcision inevitably leads to health problems later in life; infibulated women suffer from chronic urinary tract infections, hemorrhaging, pain during intercourse, and complications during pregnancy (Dreifus). Yet other forms of FGC are prevalent, especially since infibulation has been widely outlawed. The least damaging practice entails a nicking of the clitoris, the only goal being to draw a small amount of blood. The WHO category “FGM Type I” refers to the removal of part or all of the clitoris; this is commonly referred to as <em>sunna</em>, which translates to “tradition” or “duty.”  Finally, between the two extremes of Type I and Type III falls a vast range of “intermediate” practices, all of which are categorized as “FGM Type II,” and many of which are associated with some of the same health risks as Pharaonic circumcision (Williams and Sobieszczyk 967).\r\n\r\nIt is the physical damage associated with female genital cutting that, since the West began to take interest in the tradition in the 1970s, has led outsiders to passionately speak out against the practice. The WHO’s position is that “female genital mutilation is universally unacceptable because it is an infringement on the physical and psychosexual integrity of women and girls and is a form of violence against them” (Bell 130). Yet while an acknowledgment of the violence required by female genital cutting is important to discussion of and opposition to the practice, it is critical that the West come to understand FGC within the context of the culture that perpetuates the custom. As it stands, the West discusses female circumcision in terms of pain, horror, and subjugation. As evident in American commentaries and news articles as well as in the case of Khalid Adem, this representation of the issue amounts to a manipulation of what is at stake.\r\n\r\nThe trial of Khalid Adem is significant in part because it literally brought the issue home to the United States. The case attracted so much attention that a conference on FGC that was originally scheduled to take place in Nairobi, Kenya was moved to Atlanta, the reason being—according to an article in <em>The Atlanta Journal</em><em>-Constitution</em>—that the executive director of the host organization believed the trial created “an incredible opportunity to break the silence about the issue.” She went on to clarify that this silence was an affliction unique to the U.S., calling it “disturbing to see progress in Africa while in this country we’re not prepared to address the issue” (Shoichet). Indeed, many Americans will be surprised to discover that, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 168,000 African women living in the United States have undergone genital cutting (Hansen).\r\n\r\nA consideration of the West’s relationship with female circumcision from a historical perspective reveals the equally unexpected fact of the West’s own employment of the practice. Kirsten Bell, a professor at Macquarie University, says in her article “Genital Cutting and Western Discourses on Sexuality”that “the conceptual separation underlying Western treatments of male and female circumcision is alien to many Africans” (128). Most of the West has gradually made a prominent distinction between male and female circumcision (thus, the term “female circumcision” is often deemed a euphemism). This is not to suggest, however, that the West has not historically revered the latter. According to Bell, masturbation was perceived to be the cause of a number of ailments in the mid- to late-nineteenth century—asthma, epilepsy and rheumatism, to name a few. In turn, clitirodectomies (as well as male circumcision) were considered a successful cure for excessive masturbation. This belief persisted in America and Australia until the late 1960s (Bell 132). Bell asserts that “the history of female circumcision in the West sheds light on the way that changing cultural attitudes … may lead to the continuation or cessation of medical practices” (132). She refers here to the way that changes in Western perceptions of the differences between female and male genitalia have been reflected in the Western medical field, but her observation is also relevant to the potential transformation of practices in contemporary African cultures. A shift in cultural attitudes would likely precede any change in the genital cutting tradition.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the West tends to avoid becoming familiar with the cultural attitudes that are at the heart of FGC. Instead, it focuses on the horror of the physical manifestation of foreign understandings of femininity, purity, and honor. The conversation about FGC is too often reliant upon an oversimplified and superficial packaging of the issue as simply a gender-specific form of abuse. This rendering of it also happens to be the most visually communicable (if not with the use of actual images, then with the use of vivid descriptions), and the most appealing to passion. In her article “Humanitarianism and the Pornography of Pain in Anglo-American Culture,” Karen Halttunen asserts that “eighteenth-century moral philosophers treated sympathy as a sentiment stirred primarily through sight” (305). Ultimately, however, the act of seeing can be replaced by the act of imagining, fueled by stirring accounts of someone else’s suffering. In her article, Halttunen describes a custom that developed in America in the late 1700s and early 1800s in regard to journalistic publications whose purpose was to record and report on murders. She writes, “the popular account of murder became increasingly visual in its treatment of the violence of the crime, offering detailed verbal descriptions… Readers were expressly invited to envision the murder in question, to reconstruct it imaginatively in their mind’s eye, to watch the violence unfold” (312). While it may seem that there was an element of entertainment inherent in these historical accounts that cannot reasonably be pointed to in modern literature on female circumcision, Halttunen’s underlying argument is that all accounts of violence, though on some level necessary to generate sympathy, have the potential to leave people more mesmerized than sympathetic.\r\nThe first sentence of a published personal account of FGC written by a sixteen-year-old Somali girl living in Atlanta launches into a description of her own circumcision. She describes being pinned down and screaming, the “deep, cold look” on her mother’s face, her own bulging eyes, and the “surge of pain through [her] spine [that] sends [her] head back to the floor” (Hussein). Graphic personal accounts are arguably fundamental to raising awareness about FGC, yet in light of the potential that violent narratives have to appeal to readers’ lurid appetites, an effort should be made to place these accounts within a more objective frame.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent that the West’s awareness of this contextual frame is lacking.

It is customary among European Jews to name a child after a loved one who is dead. This has given me cause to frequently wonder why a deceased relative is chosen for the honor, while choosing a living relative is, if not proscribed, frowned upon. In unkind moments, I imagine it has to do with not wanting the actual people getting in the way of how we want to remember them. To “dismember” and to “remember” are not clear opposites, as “disassemble” and “reassemble” are. The “member” portions of the words are the same somewhat out of circumstance, though I still suspect a relation, if not a literal one. It is possible to remember people or places while they still exist, but it is more common, and somehow easier to do so after they have passed from the earth.\r\n\r\n[caption id="" align="alignright" width="199" caption="Figure 1"]<img title="Figure 1" src="http://www.columbia.edu/itc/uwp/journal/2009/tower1.png" alt="Figure 1" width="199" height="195" />[/caption]\r\n\r\nWalking the stretch of St. Mark’s Place between First and Third Avenues, I suspect that the street is something of a dying relative to certain New Yorkers. We love it, and we dutifully visit it because of what it once meant to us. At the same time, we cannot help notice how infirm it seems, and that, in its dementia, it no longer recognizes us, nor us, it. Perhaps, we think, it might be better once it is simply gone and we could get on with the business of remembering it in whatever idealized fashion we choose—idealizing ourselves along with it. This is a street steeped in rich history to the right kind of people: Punks, Yippies, Metalheads, Anarchists and Jazz greats—freaks all. For most of the last century, it remained steadfastly squalid and cheap, regardless of the gentrification around it. Walk along its length and you will pass the former haunts of Abbie Hoffman, Yoko Ono, Andy Warhol, Keith Haring, G.G. Allin and Lenny Bruce. In cramped, sweaty bars, the Ramones held court, as did Guns ‘N’ Roses, Iggy Pop, Thelonious Monk, The Velvet Underground and the New York Dolls. If you were too weird or too poor for the rest of New York City, this was home. Normal people didn’t bother you here. The stinking derelicts, petty theft fences, and clusters of demonic looking punks saw to it that your nickel of dirt weed could be smoked in peace on a warm night, sitting on stoops immortalized by the ’Stones and Led Zeppelin. This wasn’t heaven, but it felt like it sometimes.\r\n\r\n[caption id="" align="alignright" width="187" caption="Figure 2"]<img title="Figure 2" src="http://www.columbia.edu/itc/uwp/journal/2009/tower2.png" alt="Figure 2" width="187" height="225" />[/caption]\r\n\r\nNow the street is something very different, though still slightly strange if only because of the proliferation of Japanese <em>izakayas</em>. The storefronts—once boarded up or filled with music venues, used-record stores or crust-punk clothing shops—now host a fairly standard array of college bars, jewelry stores, yogurt peddlers, and, for a while, even a Gap. Cleanly scrubbed students walk the blocks brightly chirping into bedazzled pink cell phones. Tourists dare to waddle about clutching maps and ice cream cones, their exposed fanny packs full of passports and cash, a telling sign of just how safe they feel here.\r\n\r\nIndeed, St. Mark’s Place has become a museum of itself, down to the snack bars and gift shops. Go into the store “Search and Destroy” and for a hefty price you can attire yourself in bullet belts and bondage pants like a punk of yore. A guy I know gives Rock ‘n’ Roll walking tours, so there is even a tour guide and plenty of police acting as guards. In <em>Present Pasts: Urban Palimpsests and the Politics of Memory [1. de Certeau, Michel. <em>The Practice of Everyday Life.</em> Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984.]</em>, Andreas Huyssen points out that this is not at all uncommon or unprecedented. Huyssen references Herman Lübbe, who “showed how musealization was no longer bound to the institution of the museum… but had come to infiltrate all areas of everyday life” (22). St. Mark''s Place is clearly such a monument, but what kind? Who curates such a museum (mausoleum?) and why? More importantly, can a place still be “alive” and yet function in this self-referential fashion?\r\n\r\nIn “The Necessity for Ruins,” John Jackson gives us two broad categories into which monuments fall. The first is the “hortatory sort,” which functions to “remind us of something important. That is to say it puts people in mind of some obligation they have incurred” (Jackson 90-91). Those who spent, or misspent, some of their youth on these streets might agree that it reminds them of something important, certainly, but the societal covenant or standard of behavior Jackson references isn’t readily apparent. The second is what Jackson refers to as the “contemporary American celebration,” which\r\n<blockquote>suggests that the past is a remote, ill-defined period or environment when a kind of golden age prevailed, when society had an innocence or a simplicity that we have since lost; a period usually referred to as The Old Days, or as (Eliade calls it)<em> in illo tempore</em> – in those days – a time without significant events, and a landscape without monuments (98).</blockquote>\r\nIn order to categorize St. Mark’s, we have to consider the use of the space by various classes of people. This is complicated by virtue of it being a “living” monument. By this, I mean that it is not specifically a space set aside for remembrance in a prescribed way. In a traditional monument, such as a museum, there is a triangular relationship between the exhibit itself, the curators, and the tourists. In an area where people live, work and enjoy themselves more or less as they see fit, this triangular relationship is complicated by the denizens of the space and a group I call the “re-creationists.”\r\n\r\n[caption id="" align="alignright" width="220" caption="Figure 3"]<img title="Figure 3" src="http://www.columbia.edu/itc/uwp/journal/2009/tower3.png" alt="Figure 3" width="220" height="164" />[/caption]\r\n\r\nIf you go to St. Mark’s now, you will see young people of high school and college age dressing and acting like the Punks of the ’70s, ’80s and ’90s. They sit on stoops, beg for money, ride skateboards, and do their level best to recreate some indeterminate past that they were not actually alive to see. They are mostly middle-class kids chasing a scene that no longer exists. It’s as if you built Colonial Williamsburg, and people just started showing up and acting like blacksmiths and town criers for free. I would posit that to them, St. Mark’s is a blending of both of Jackson’s modes. Jackson describes them—and their hortatory motivation for using the space—when he quotes the orator at a monument dedication from the 1830s, “monuments are lasting incentives, to those who view them, to imitate the virtues they commemorate, and attain, by their life and spirit, glory and honor” (92). Perhaps “glory and honor” are not exactly the right words for whatever constitutes the Punk aesthetic, but the general sentiment seems to apply.\r\n\r\nTo be clear though, the nostalgic draw of St. Mark’s shops and punks, this “marketing of memory” (Huyssen 15), is very different from the specific circumstances and needs that gave rise to the memory in the first place. In fact, they can be diametrically opposed. The used-record and clothing stores operated on the principle of artistic poverty: by buying goods from people with nothing left to sell and selling them to people with only slightly more. These types of stores existed because the proprietors could not afford better either. Now, the shopkeepers cater to and have, to a certain extent, participated in the recent wealth of the area.\r\n\r\nEven so, by their look and their “spatial acting out of a place” (98), as Michel de Certeau puts it in his book <em>The Practice of Everyday Life</em>, the re-creationists and the old shopkeepers of the remaining punk clothing and used-record stores provide a link to the area’s past: essentially they are curating the space as well as being part of the exhibit. de Certeau''s concept offers a model for understanding a place where the interactions of the participants with the space are paramount. On St. Mark’s, the re-creationists and old shopkeepers enunciate their portion of the “language” of the street by being largely static. Both groups confine themselves to the “phrases” given shape by their stores and apartments, the pseudo punks limited by the stoops and sidewalks, moving usually only when rousted by the police. By these groups’ actions, and the confined nature of their actions, one can easily compare them to a more traditional monument.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the new shopkeepers, with their expensive jewelry and international foods, suggest a new language existing next to, or perhaps on top of, the old. The spaces occupied are the same, but the new content and the new users provide a completely different set of possible “modalities of pedestrian enunciation,” they\r\n<blockquote>include the kinds of relationship this enunciation entertains with particular paths (or “statements”) by according them a truth value (“alethic” modalities of the necessary, the impossible, the possible or the contingent), an epistemological value (“epistemic” modalities of the certain, the excluded the plausible or the questionable), or finally an ethical or legal value (“deodontic” modalities of the obligatory, the forbidden, the permitted, or the optional). (de Certeau 99)</blockquote>\r\nThe spaces are similar to what they used to be, and in one or two cases, the stores are even the same, but the uses according to all three modalities (alethic, epistemic, and deodontic) are quite different. Squatting without purpose is no longer encouraged or permitted, nor is illegal activity such as drug use or the resale of “slightly used” home audio gear. The music blaring from venues, homes, and boom boxes is gone. In their place are the polite and brisk enunciations of commerce, tourism, and collegiate binge drinking. The new pedestrian additions to the area redefine the space to encourage movement rather than squatting or confined mobility. Pedestrians tour the area and walk up and down its length. They briefly stop to sit at sidewalk cafes or make purchases. They hop from bar to bar, and then head off to someplace else.\r\n\r\nI’m reminded of a scene from the movie <em>Excalibur</em> in which Albion is in ruin and Arthur rides one final time to confront Mordred and Morgana LeFay. As he passes, the land is renewed and blooms in his wake. Behind these new walkers in St. Mark’s remain fresh coats of paint, <em>Ramen-yas</em>, bubble tea stalls, and Chipotle franchises. Watching this process play out over time, you can see that in a market-driven system, the space is also curated by the users. They choose the bulk of exhibits, how one interacts with them, and even the “suggested donation” by choosing how much they are willing to pay for entrance and interaction with the space. In addition, it is they who make St. Mark’s—no longer as predatory and filthy—safe enough for the re-creationists, though I do not think the latter group would ever admit to such a thing. The fact of the matter is, that while they complain about how these blocks are no longer “punk,” it is unlikely that they would have been willing or able to exist there when it truly was.\r\n\r\n[caption id="" align="alignright" width="293" caption="Figure 4"]<img title="Figure 4" src="http://www.columbia.edu/itc/uwp/journal/2009/tower4.png" alt="Figure 4" width="293" height="221" />[/caption]\r\n\r\nLike any “living” monument, St. Mark''s place is fluid and shifting, curated by many people in various groups. It takes the form and function of Jackson’s modes of monumentality, depending in part on whom you might ask. The re-creationist punks and the old shopkeepers curate and use the space, begrudgingly guided and supported by the tourists who spend their time and money there. This is natural, unavoidable, and—might I even suggest—healthy, because “there is no pure space outside of commodity culture, however much we may desire such a space” (Huyssen 19). To me and to others of older generations, it is a monument because we have grown conscious that we ourselves are dying. As we feel our mortality, we look to something more permanent, something that lives on, as this space does via the new life given it by the very changes it has undergone. As we lose relevance and fade, the space can carry some little piece of us into the future.\r\n\r\nIt is this very process that makes something a monument. Something must pass so that there is a will to recall it. The new generations of users of the space, those to whom it is not a monument or whose view of it is radically different from that of the older generation, need us to get out of their way so they can continue to define the space without our interference or insistence that it must mean the same to them as it did to us. This insistence is pure “codgery,” and best explained by comparing us to de Certeau’s “Ministers of Knowledge,” who “have always assumed that the whole universe was threatened by the very changes that affected their ideologies and their positions. They transmute the misfortune of their theories into theories of misfortune” (95-96). This street is thousands of monuments to thousands of people, and each one of those winks out as those people shuffle off. In the room cleared by our exit, and the quieting of voices insisting that it means this or that, a living space like St. Mark’s Place becomes—to new people for new reasons—a new monument.', 'In the Bones of Giants ', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'in-the-bones-of-giants', '', '', '2012-03-23 15:22:01', '2012-03-23 15:22:01', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?p=35', 0, 'essay', '', 0),

(378, 8, '2012-02-27 14:47:18', '2012-02-27 14:47:18', 'Every year that we intend to spend the summer in Pakistan, my mother spends at least two months beforehand assembling gifts for the multitude of people we know there.  She buys chocolates and sneakers for my cousins, perfumes and wristwatches for my uncles, purses for her college friends, sweaters for my grandparents, and often a pair of shoes for Yunis Chacha. “Chacha” means uncle, but while Yunis knows my face and age and predilection for tandoori naan, I don’t call him “ uncle” because he’s related to me by blood: Yunis Chacha is my grandparents’ oldest servant.\n\nAt first glance, servitude in Pakistan and America seem vastly different, and not only because Pakistani family members are so familiar with their employees.  Almost every practice, from hiring servants to asking them to serve dinner, differs in these two countries.  Yet I feel the same guilt tiptoeing around the workers from the cleaning service my parents hire in suburban Pittsburgh as I do asking Yunis Chacha to make me tea. W hy is this so? Barbara Ehrenreich, author of “Maid to Order,” might be able to help explain my moral distress.  For this article in <em>Harper’s</em>, she spent several months working as a maid for a corporate cleaning service in Maine. Through an exploration of class, gender, subjugation and personal moral development, Ehrenreich raises this question : “As the home becomes a workplace for someone else ” — in Pakistan or America— “is it still a place where you want to live?” (62).\nThe middle class Pakistani household is distinct from its American counterpart in many ways. In my grandparents’ home, for example, three employees are almost always present: a watchman for the gate, a cook, and another catch-all employee ( he’s the one sent out for quick errands or the one who sets the table for tea).  A woman comes by every day to do the laundry and clean; the gardener comes by every second or third day.  My parents’ house, situated in a comfortable Pittsburgh suburb, is miles away from Pakistan not only geographically but also atmospherically.  Though my parents are objectively better off than the preceding generation, they cook their own food and make their own beds.  They do, however, hire a landscaping service and a cleaning service—practices that are becoming increasingly popular amongst upper-middle class professionals (Ehrenreich 62).\nIt’s true that my family benefits from these workers, but isn’t it true that I benefit from the work of others every single day? I do not weave and stitch my own clothes—nor do I grow or cook much of the food I eat.  As Ehrenreich puts it, “Why should housework, among all the goods and services we consume, arouse any special angst?” (69).  She provides the answer to her own question—housework is different from other products and services “because of its proximity to the activities that compose ‘private’ life” (69).  Furthermore, she claims that having maids in the house can damage one’s moral character.  According to Ehrenreich, having maids teaches children to valorize their own personal worth and time more than that of others (i.e. their parents’ employees).  Because children with maids never have to clean up after themselves, they don’t learn responsibility and therefore “achieve a certain magical weightlessness and immateriality” (70).\nThis is the weakest aspect of Ehrenreich’s argument: unlike the rest of her article, in which she bolsters her arguments with empirical observations based on personal experience or statistical data, here she makes a generalized, value-laden statement about a large number of people without citing any sources.  True, some children who grow up in homes with maids might become lazy and inconsiderate individuals, but is that always the case?  I have not found it to be so.  P ersonally, I am morally troubled by hiring others in my home, but not because I don’t always pick up my own socks .  Some of my friends here in college have grown up with maids as well, but they don’t expect fairies to come down and dust their tables—they do it themselves. Hiring maids simply cannot be morally troubling because of the nature or location of the work in question, so something else must be at play.\nIn Pakistan, there is no shame in employing servants: virtually all middle class and upper class households have them.  Having not grown up constantly in Pakistani society, when I return, I invariably feel guilty asking Yunis Chacha to make me tea or bring dinner to my room—requests my relatives insist are nothing out of the ordinary.  Yet no matter how many times my aunt patiently explains that we’re actually doing his family a service by hiring him, I cannot come to terms with it.  It is true that the economy in Pakistan is not as stable or as successful as that of America’s.  B ecause of the lack of a good public education system, poor individuals, especially in rural areas, are unable to accrue skills that would enable them to attain middle class jobs in the future.  They then rely on the middle and upper class for employment.  Therefore, being a servant in a home is an important niche in the lower class job spectrum.  If servitude is such a vital part of the economy and way of life, why should I be disgusted with myself when, possessing two healthy legs and knowledge of the house’s layout, I wish to ask Yunis Chacha to get me tea?\nBruce Robbins, author of “The Sweatshop Sublime,” helps me to better understand my aunt’s position, but he also broadens my dilemma:\n<blockquote>[ D ]isgust with dependence on the work of other people in the home risks passing over into disgust with the dependence on the work of other people in general—a disgust with being a part of a highly elaborate division of labor. Yet learning to be a part of that division is a precondition for almost any progressive politics, nationally and internationally. (92)\n\nIt makes sense: middle and upper class households in Pakistan, by hiring lower class servants, provide those individuals with jobs.  This interdependence is characteristic of our international system—as American consumers, we rely on Chinese laborers to produce clothes and Mexican immigrants to pick vegetables.  It is unrealistic for us to expect to function without dependence on services, without dependence on the labor of other people.  What difference does it make if workers are sweating away in a field hundreds of miles away or if they’re in the sweatshops that we call home?</blockquote>\nIt does make a difference.  In his essay, Robbins recounts Kant’s definition of the sublime, in which there is a “feeling of the inadequacy of the imagination for presenting the ideas of a whole, wherein the imagination reaches its maximum, and, in striving to surpass it, sinks back into itself, by which, however, a kind of emotional satisfaction is produced” ( 85).  Robbins applies this idea within the modern context of globalization and sweatshops.  I n short, there are times in which comfortable, upper middle class individuals feel momentarily guilty about Chinese sweatshop laborers who’ve toiled over their clothing for little to no pay, but this feeling quickly passes.   Upper middle class individuals are satisfied to have at least briefly contemplated the problem, but as they do not interrupt the routine of their daily lives in an attempt to solve it, it has no lasting effect.  This sensation is more difficult to produce when the sweatshop is one’s own home: lacking the luxury of having their laborers separated from them by languages or miles, homeowners hiring maids or employing servants must face the laborers working for them every single day.\n\nWhat, then, is the problem?  If division of labor is an acceptable part of life, then why should an employer feel guilty about bringing workers into her home? In “Maid to Order,” Ehrenreich nails the answer: “Housework was not degrading because it was manual labor… but because it was embedded in degrading relationships and inevitably served to reinforce them” (61).  She is speaking within a feminist context, but gender relations are not the only hierarchies reinforced through household labor. Just as women have been professionally restricted because of their obligation to the bathroom floor and the kitchen table, certain families in Pakistan have been generationally disadvantaged because of their roles as household servants.\n\nThe Pakistani public education system is absolutely dismal: it yields no opportunities for the already disadvantaged to improve their station.  Graduate and professional schools are only realistic ambitions for children whose parents have attended those types of schools.  Yunis Chacha’s daughter Aliya is an excellent illustration of this point: Yunis has been employed in my grandparents’ home for over forty years, and his daughter, when she was of an able age to work, joined him at his workplace.  Whereas he would cook dinner and brew tea, she would make beds and wash clothes.  Aliya stopped going to school at the age of thirteen to help her parents bring in an income; her children will likely stop going to school at the same age, and for the same reason.  My mother and her siblings, on the other hand, who grew up at the same time as Aliya, all went to private schools, completed graduate school, and went on to lead comparatively affluent and comfortable lives.\n\nThe guilt I feel when I ask Yunis Chacha to bring me tea is not so much my disgust with division of labor as a whole.  I t is much more complicated than that. It is my recognition that his role as a worker in my house is representative of our respective roles in Pakistani society, which reflects not only our socioeconomic statuses, but also those of our children and grandchildren.  In Pakistan, both wealth and poverty are maintained throughout generations because the barriers to social mobility are staggeringly high.  The guilt is recognition of precisely this: Yunis Chacha probably never chose his line of work, and he and his successive generations are stuck in a rut of servitude, whereas I, daughter of professionals and student at a re nowned university, have myriad opportunities available to me, ripe for the picking.  The problem is not that there is servitude; it is that I will never have to be a servant. I do not feel guilty because I go to an Ivy League school, but because Aliya will never be able to.\n\nIs American society really so different from the one half a world away?  I would argue—and Ehrenreich might agree—that social mobility in these two countries is more similar than it seems at first glance.  Whereas housework in Pakistan is emblematic of generational poverty, in America housework is representative of the subjugation of women and minorities. Ehrenreich claims that “the association between housecleaning and minority status is well established in the psyches of the white employing class” (63).  This is not without any basis in reality: “One thing you can say with certainty about the population of household workers,” Ehrenreich claims, “is that they are disproportionately women of color: ‘lower’ kinds of people for a ‘lower’ kind of work.  Of the ‘private household cleaners and servants’ it managed to locate in 1998, the Bureau of Labor statistics reports that 36.8 percent were Hispanic, 15.8 percent black, and 2.7 percent ‘other’” (63).  Furthermore, studies conducted by the<em>New York Times</em> for the  recent series “Class Matters” concluded that social mobility in America is not quite as attainable as it seems.  Data from the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s show that people are increasingly remaining in their socioeconomic class: while in the 1970s 35% of people stayed in their class, in the 1990s 40% did (Leonhardt).  Additionally, whereas 27% of families were able to move up or down two quintiles in the 70s, only 21% were able to do so in the 1990s (Leonhardt).  People in America are becoming less able, on average, to change their socioeconomic class.  Since in America race and class often come paired, this means not only that the country experiences generational poverty to an extent that we do not realize, it also means that generational poverty is occurring in a disproportionately high number of minority families.\n\nRobbins has a point: division of labor is necessary, inside and outside the home, and it is not useful to decry the fact that people outsource the loathsome task of wiping the toilet seat simply because wiping the toilet seat is in and of itself distasteful.  It is simply the case that the world is interdependent and that within this complex system of divided labor there are tasks less desirable than others.  It is not so much a problem that division of labor exists and that within it there is a hierarchy.  T here is a problem in that division of labor <em>maintains</em> a certain hierarchy.  This is the point Ehrenreich recognizes, and addresses well: housework has become symbolic of historic exploitation of gender, class, and race.  In both Pakistan and America, housework is simply the obvious example of a much greater problem.  The solution would be to make social mobility a more feasible reality, especially for the historically disadvantaged. That task is an enormous one, however, too great for the confines of these pages. Hopefully, by furthering discourse on these important topics, we can come to a greater understanding of them and enable ourselves to address them in the future.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;', 'On Servitude and Division of Labor in Pakistan and America', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '231-autosave', '', '', '2012-02-27 14:47:18', '2012-02-27 14:47:18', '', 231, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?p=378', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

This is a street steeped in rich history to the right kind of people: Punks, Yippies, Metalheads, Anarchists and Jazz greats—freaks all. For most of the last century, it remained steadfastly squalid and cheap, regardless of the gentrification around it. Walk along its length and you will pass the former haunts of Abbie Hoffman, Yoko Ono, Andy Warhol, Keith Haring, G.G. Allin and Lenny Bruce. In cramped, sweaty bars, the Ramones held court, as did Guns ‘N’ Roses, Iggy Pop, Thelonious Monk, The Velvet Underground and the New York Dolls. If you were too weird or too poor for the rest of New York City, this was home. Normal people didn’t bother you here. The stinking derelicts, petty theft fences, and clusters of demonic looking punks saw to it that your nickel of dirt weed could be smoked in peace on a warm night, sitting on stoops immortalized by the ’Stones and Led Zeppelin. This wasn’t heaven, but it felt like it sometimes.\n\n<img src="http://www.columbia.edu/itc/uwp/journal/2009/tower2.png" alt="" />\n\nNow the street is something very different, though still slightly strange if only because of the proliferation of Japanese <em>izakayas</em>.

Cleanly scrubbed students walk the blocks brightly chirping into bedazzled pink cell phones. Tourists dare to waddle about clutching maps and ice cream cones, their exposed fanny packs full of passports and cash, a telling sign of just how safe they feel here.\n\nIndeed, St. Mark’s Place has become a museum of itself, down to the snack bars and gift shops.

In <em>Present Pasts: Urban Palimpsests and the Politics of Memory [1. de Certeau, Michel. <em>The Practice of Everyday Life.</em> Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984.]</em>, Andreas Huyssen points out that this is not at all uncommon or unprecedented. Huyssen references Herman Lübbe, who “showed how musealization was no longer bound to the institution of the museum… but had come to infiltrate all areas of everyday life” (22). St. Mark''s Place is clearly such a monument, but what kind? Who curates such a museum (mausoleum?) and why? More importantly, can a place still be “alive” and yet function in this self-referential fashion?\n\nIn “The Necessity for Ruins,” John Jackson gives us two broad categories into which monuments fall. The first is the “hortatory sort,” which functions to “remind us of something important. That is to say it puts people in mind of some obligation they have incurred” (Jackson 90-91). Those who spent, or misspent, some of their youth on these streets might agree that it reminds them of something important, certainly, but the societal covenant or standard of behavior Jackson references isn’t readily apparent. The second is what Jackson refers to as the “contemporary American celebration,” which\n<blockquote>suggests that the past is a remote, ill-defined period or environment when a kind of golden age prevailed, when society had an innocence or a simplicity that we have since lost; a period usually referred to as The Old Days, or as (Eliade calls it)<em> in illo tempore</em> – in those days – a time without significant events, and a landscape without monuments (98).</blockquote>\nIn order to categorize St. Mark’s, we have to consider the use of the space by various classes of people. This is complicated by virtue of it being a “living” monument. By this, I mean that it is not specifically a space set aside for remembrance in a prescribed way. In a traditional monument, such as a museum, there is a triangular relationship between the exhibit itself, the curators, and the tourists. In an area where people live, work and enjoy themselves more or less as they see fit, this triangular relationship is complicated by the denizens of the space and a group I call the “re-creationists.”\n\n<img src="http://www.columbia.edu/itc/uwp/journal/2009/tower3.png" alt="" />\n\nIf you go to St. Mark’s now, you will see young people of high school and college age dressing and acting like the Punks of the ’70s, ’80s and ’90s. They sit on stoops, beg for money, ride skateboards, and do their level best to recreate some indeterminate past that they were not actually alive to see. They are mostly middle-class kids chasing a scene that no longer exists. It’s as if you built Colonial Williamsburg, and people just started showing up and acting like blacksmiths and town criers for free. I would posit that to them, St. Mark’s is a blending of both of Jackson’s modes. Jackson describes them—and their hortatory motivation for using the space—when he quotes the orator at a monument dedication from the 1830s, “monuments are lasting incentives, to those who view them, to imitate the virtues they commemorate, and attain, by their life and spirit, glory and honor” (92). Perhaps “glory and honor” are not exactly the right words for whatever constitutes the Punk aesthetic, but the general sentiment seems to apply.\n\nTo be clear though, the nostalgic draw of St. Mark’s shops and punks, this “marketing of memory” (Huyssen 15), is very different from the specific circumstances and needs that gave rise to the memory in the first place. In fact, they can be diametrically opposed. The used-record and clothing stores operated on the principle of artistic poverty: by buying goods from people with nothing left to sell and selling them to people with only slightly more. These types of stores existed because the proprietors could not afford better either. Now, the shopkeepers cater to and have, to a certain extent, participated in the recent wealth of the area.\n\nEven so, by their look and their “spatial acting out of a place” (98), as Michel de Certeau puts it in his book <em>The Practice of Everyday Life</em>, the re-creationists and the old shopkeepers of the remaining punk clothing and used-record stores provide a link to the area’s past: essentially they are curating the space as well as being part of the exhibit. de Certeau''s concept offers a model for understanding a place where the interactions of the participants with the space are paramount. On St. Mark’s, the re-creationists and old shopkeepers enunciate their portion of the “language” of the street by being largely static. Both groups confine themselves to the “phrases” given shape by their stores and apartments, the pseudo punks limited by the stoops and sidewalks, moving usually only when rousted by the police. By these groups’ actions, and the confined nature of their actions, one can easily compare them to a more traditional monument.\n\nFurthermore, the new shopkeepers, with their expensive jewelry and international foods, suggest a new language existing next to, or perhaps on top of, the old. The spaces occupied are the same, but the new content and the new users provide a completely different set of possible “modalities of pedestrian enunciation,” they\n<blockquote>include the kinds of relationship this enunciation entertains with particular paths (or “statements”) by according them a truth value (“alethic” modalities of the necessary, the impossible, the possible or the contingent), an epistemological value (“epistemic” modalities of the certain, the excluded the plausible or the questionable), or finally an ethical or legal value (“deodontic” modalities of the obligatory, the forbidden, the permitted, or the optional). (de Certeau 99)</blockquote>\nThe spaces are similar to what they used to be, and in one or two cases, the stores are even the same, but the uses according to all three modalities (alethic, epistemic, and deodontic) are quite different. Squatting without purpose is no longer encouraged or permitted, nor is illegal activity such as drug use or the resale of “slightly used” home audio gear. The music blaring from venues, homes, and boom boxes is gone. In their place are the polite and brisk enunciations of commerce, tourism, and collegiate binge drinking. The new pedestrian additions to the area redefine the space to encourage movement rather than squatting or confined mobility. Pedestrians tour the area and walk up and down its length. They briefly stop to sit at sidewalk cafes or make purchases. They hop from bar to bar, and then head off to someplace else.\n\nI’m reminded of a scene from the movie <em>Excalibur</em> in which Albion is in ruin and Arthur rides one final time to confront Mordred and Morgana LeFay. As he passes, the land is renewed and blooms in his wake. Behind these new walkers in St. Mark’s remain fresh coats of paint, <em>Ramen-yas</em>, bubble tea stalls, and Chipotle franchises. Watching this process play out over time, you can see that in a market-driven system, the space is also curated by the users. They choose the bulk of exhibits, how one interacts with them, and even the “suggested donation” by choosing how much they are willing to pay for entrance and interaction with the space. In addition, it is they who make St. Mark’s—no longer as predatory and filthy—safe enough for the re-creationists, though I do not think the latter group would ever admit to such a thing. The fact of the matter is, that while they complain about how these blocks are no longer “punk,” it is unlikely that they would have been willing or able to exist there when it truly was.\n\n<img src="http://www.columbia.edu/itc/uwp/journal/2009/tower4.png" alt="" />\n\nLike any “living” monument, St. Mark''s place is fluid and shifting, curated by many people in various groups. It takes the form and function of Jackson’s modes of monumentality, depending in part on whom you might ask. The re-creationist punks and the old shopkeepers curate and use the space, begrudgingly guided and supported by the tourists who spend their time and money there. This is natural, unavoidable, and—might I even suggest—healthy, because “there is no pure space outside of commodity culture, however much we may desire such a space” (Huyssen 19). To me and to others of older generations, it is a monument because we have grown conscious that we ourselves are dying. As we feel our mortality, we look to something more permanent, something that lives on, as this space does via the new life given it by the very changes it has undergone. As we lose relevance and fade, the space can carry some little piece of us into the future.\n\nIt is this very process that makes something a monument. Something must pass so that there is a will to recall it. The new generations of users of the space, those to whom it is not a monument or whose view of it is radically different from that of the older generation, need us to get out of their way so they can continue to define the space without our interference or insistence that it must mean the same to them as it did to us. This insistence is pure “codgery,” and best explained by comparing us to de Certeau’s “Ministers of Knowledge,” who “have always assumed that the whole universe was threatened by the very changes that affected their ideologies and their positions. They transmute the misfortune of their theories into theories of misfortune” (95-96). This street is thousands of monuments to thousands of people, and each one of those winks out as those people shuffle off. In the room cleared by our exit, and the quieting of voices insisting that it means this or that, a living space like St. Mark’s Place becomes—to new people for new reasons—a new monument.', 'In the Bones of Giants ', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '35-autosave', '', '', '2012-02-28 09:38:35', '2012-02-28 09:38:35', '', 35, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?p=37', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

It is customary among European Jews to name a child after a loved one who is dead. This has given me cause to frequently wonder why a deceased relative is chosen for the honor, while choosing a living relative is, if not proscribed, frowned upon. In unkind moments, I imagine it has to do with not wanting the actual people getting in the way of how we want to remember them. To “dismember” and to “remember” are not clear opposites, as “disassemble” and “reassemble” are. The “member” portions of the words are the same somewhat out of circumstance, though I still suspect a relation, if not a literal one. It is possible to remember people or places while they still exist, but it is more common, and somehow easier to do so after they have passed from the earth.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img src="http://www.columbia.edu/itc/uwp/journal/2009/tower1.png" alt="" />\r\n\r\nFigure 1. 96-98 St. Mark''s Place.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWalking the stretch of St. Mark’s Place between First and Third Avenues, I suspect that the street is something of a dying relative to certain New Yorkers.

Forster’s essay, “What I Believe” addresses this pervasive mental struggle.  Forster’s ultimate humanist goal in the essay is to find a life philosophy independent from the dogma of religion, evidenced by his opening sentences, “I do not believe in Belief.  But this is an age of faith, and there are so many militant creeds that, in self-defense, one has to formulate a creed of one’s own” (67).  He suggests his era embraces the notion of religious faith too wholeheartedly, and he wants to develop a functional alternative.  To achieve this, Forster affirms that life should be lived to create, ultimately, “tolerance, good temper, and sympathy” (67). In his attempt to reach this philosophical ideal, he highlights the inevitability of turning to belief, even in his fiercely non-religious worldview. Forster’s essay raises, and may implicitly answer, the enduring question: <em>Can reason coexist with belief?</em>  In the essay, it becomes apparent that reason <em>can</em>, in fact, coexist with belief, provided that belief is founded upon and cooperative with empirical and philosophical derivations.  That is, provided it is not <em>blind</em> faith.\r\n\r\nFrom the outset of his essay, Forster criticizes religion and the tenets it seeks to uphold.  The very first sentence of the essay, “I do not believe in belief,” suggests that Forster withholds his commitment to anything requiring blind-faith acceptance of a rule (67).  He feels assaulted by the “militant creeds” of the Age of Faith, or religious reactionism, and writes in part to defend his humanistic principles against this threat (67).  One of the more pointed rejections of religious faith is expressed in his discussion of the principles of Christianity, “[The orthodox say] man has failed and always will fail to organize his own goodness, and it is presumptuous of him to try.  This claim—solemn as it is— leaves me cold.  I cannot believe that Christianity will ever cope with the present worldwide mess…” (75).  He is arguing that it is man’s <em>duty</em> to clarify for himself his own values. This argument for intellectual independence characterizes Forster’s stance on the issue of belief, leaving no doubt that he is opposed to religious faith.\r\n\r\nA consequence of Forster’s wholehearted rejection of blind faith, religion, and maybe even God, is that is seems he must develop his own philosophy based exclusively on reason.  But paradoxically peppered throughout the essay are passages that both triumphantly accept reason, and implicitly praise faith. This is not a logical pitfall of Forster’s essay but a manifestation of the subtle distinction between religious faith and humanistic faith that Forster seeks to establish.  Regarding personal relationships he claims, “For the purpose of living one has to assume that the personality is solid and the self is an entity, and to ignore all contrary evidence.  And since to ignore evidence is one of the characteristics of faith, I can certainly proclaim I believe in personal relationships” (68). Furthermore, he explains, “The people I respect most behave as if they were immortal and as if society was eternal” (71).  Both these quotes contain an explicit abandonment of reason and an acceptance of faith.  But even so, Forster carves a distinction between the religious belief he feels is reckless and the principled belief he feels is both constructive and unavoidable.  Subscribing to religious dogma does not satisfy Forster’s skeptical stance on faith, but holding to considered, principled beliefs like the ones above do.  Ultimately, he understands that reason and belief are hopelessly intertwined, and that there is a correct and constructive way to arrive at belief, and an incorrect, destructive way.  Given the historical context of the essay, this principle is particularly poignant.\r\n\r\nPublished in 1938, “What I Believe” was written in the throes of the political and social instability that led to World War II. A number of remarks within the essay point to Forster’s acute awareness of the unrest of the time.  He discusses a “gathering political storm,” mentions the merits of democracy allowing “public criticism” and avoiding “hushed up scandals,” mentions “labor camps” as a consequence of extreme governmental control, and notably ambiguously asserts “some people idealize force and pull it to the foreground and worship it” (68, 69, 70). Clearly, Forster was well aware of the brewing political issues of World War II and his essay is in part a reaction to the philosophical confusion and gravity of the coming war.  When viewed in this light, the dissonance between belief and reason takes on new meaning.  The war itself highlighted the fact that two logically derived diverging philosophies can exist and each side may still vehemently oppose the other. In the struggle of democracy vs. totalitarianism at which Forster hints heavily, both sides had justifications for their stances and, of course, their rhetoric for each would have been particularly pervasive in 1938.  The Axis powers asserted that totalitarianism provided order, cohesion, obedience, and efficiency and the Allied powers argued democracy promoted free speech, individual liberties, creativity, and social justice (Palmieri)\r\n\r\n(Griggs ).  Both sides had their intellectual stances, but both possessed something further: faith that their cause was correct. Just as Forster sought to define a humanistic philosophy that satisfied his ideals, the two sides developed their philosophies to satisfy their preconceived faith.  Forster captures this quiet parallel in his extensive discussion of democracy, and maybe most revealingly demonstrates his fears in the conclusion of his essay, “…one likes to say what one thinks while speech is comparatively free: it may not be free much longer” (76).  Clearly, Forster understands the war and its ideological struggle may come at a heavy cost.\r\n\r\nBut what is the importance of the philosophical dichotomy between the Allied and Axis powers and its phantom presence within the context of Forster’s essay?  It illustrates how belief is inexorably intertwined with reason.  That is, we use reason to accommodate belief and belief to accommodate reason.  Forster, in his essay, was using the irony of rejecting one belief and asserting another to capture the futility of arguing a point based largely, or entirely, on blind faith.  This parallels the political struggle of the time.  At the same time, he understands faith is inevitable and is wrestling with the implications of this reality.  Faced with war and the potential losses of lives and freedom, a satisfying solution to the issue of belief vs. reason seems particularly urgent.  Ultimately, he knows he cannot argue his worldview against another if it is buoyed by dogma, so he seeks to change faith’s “big ‘F’” to a little “f” by transforming the monolithic faith necessary for religion with one that coincides with our innate sense of common humanity.  He explains that the religious, those whose faith he does not support, “have faith with a large F.  My faith has a very small one, and I only intrude it because these are very strenuous days” (76).\r\n\r\nTo Forster, faith is inevitable; blind faith is not.  He illustrates that at some level we must accept certain central axioms on faith to live our intellectual lives at all (belief in personal relationships, the permanence of human civilization, democracy, an aristocracy of intelligentsia, etc.).  We do not and cannot know if these are true, but our choice of what and what not to have faith in is not necessarily blind.  It reflects our understanding of how the world is, and how we feel it should be, an empirically idealistic guess. Forster and those who subscribe to his distinction between beliefs, attempt to capture how the world appears, and further, how it <em>should</em> work.  Forster embraces relationships, aristocracy of intelligentsia, living life as if it had no end, and acting as if civilization was eternal not because he knows these things are true, but because these satisfy his understanding of how the world must exist for a philosophically, humanistically, and personally satisfying life.\r\n\r\nForster does not reject faith—only faith stemming from religion.  The chief difference between faith in religion and faith in principles, and the reason Forster makes this seemingly “splitting hairs” distinction, is that the former must necessarily be blind, while the latter is informed to the extent it reflects some ideal about the human condition reached through consideration, not dogmatic acceptance.  Belief and reason are not in fact mutually exclusive, but are both unavoidable and can even complement each other handsomely, provided that faith is not employed as a simplistic and convenient replacement for thought, but as a mechanism for developing informed principles.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'test essay 2', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'test-essay-2-2', '', '', '2012-04-10 19:53:22', '2012-04-10 19:53:22', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=506', 0, 'essay', '', 0),

Forster’s essay, “What I Believe” addresses this pervasive mental struggle.  Forster’s ultimate humanist goal in the essay is to find a life philosophy independent from the dogma of religion, evidenced by his opening sentences, “I do not believe in Belief.  But this is an age of faith, and there are so many militant creeds that, in self-defense, one has to formulate a creed of one’s own” (67).  He suggests his era embraces the notion of religious faith too wholeheartedly, and he wants to develop a functional alternative.  To achieve this, Forster affirms that life should be lived to create, ultimately, “tolerance, good temper, and sympathy” (67). In his attempt to reach this philosophical ideal, he highlights the inevitability of turning to belief, even in his fiercely non-religious worldview. Forster’s essay raises, and may implicitly answer, the enduring question: <em>Can reason coexist with belief?</em>  In the essay, it becomes apparent that reason <em>can</em>, in fact, coexist with belief, provided that belief is founded upon and cooperative with empirical and philosophical derivations.  That is, provided it is not <em>blind</em> faith.\n\nFrom the outset of his essay, Forster criticizes religion and the tenets it seeks to uphold.  The very first sentence of the essay, “I do not believe in belief,” suggests that Forster withholds his commitment to anything requiring blind-faith acceptance of a rule (67).  He feels assaulted by the “militant creeds” of the Age of Faith, or religious reactionism, and writes in part to defend his humanistic principles against this threat (67).  One of the more pointed rejections of religious faith is expressed in his discussion of the principles of Christianity, “[The orthodox say] man has failed and always will fail to organize his own goodness, and it is presumptuous of him to try.  This claim—solemn as it is— leaves me cold.  I cannot believe that Christianity will ever cope with the present worldwide mess…” (75).  He is arguing that it is man’s <em>duty</em> to clarify for himself his own values. This argument for intellectual independence characterizes Forster’s stance on the issue of belief, leaving no doubt that he is opposed to religious faith.\n\nA consequence of Forster’s wholehearted rejection of blind faith, religion, and maybe even God, is that is seems he must develop his own philosophy based exclusively on reason.  But paradoxically peppered throughout the essay are passages that both triumphantly accept reason, and implicitly praise faith. This is not a logical pitfall of Forster’s essay but a manifestation of the subtle distinction between religious faith and humanistic faith that Forster seeks to establish.  Regarding personal relationships he claims, “For the purpose of living one has to assume that the personality is solid and the self is an entity, and to ignore all contrary evidence.  And since to ignore evidence is one of the characteristics of faith, I can certainly proclaim I believe in personal relationships” (68). Furthermore, he explains, “The people I respect most behave as if they were immortal and as if society was eternal” (71).  Both these quotes contain an explicit abandonment of reason and an acceptance of faith.  But even so, Forster carves a distinction between the religious belief he feels is reckless and the principled belief he feels is both constructive and unavoidable.  Subscribing to religious dogma does not satisfy Forster’s skeptical stance on faith, but holding to considered, principled beliefs like the ones above do.  Ultimately, he understands that reason and belief are hopelessly intertwined, and that there is a correct and constructive way to arrive at belief, and an incorrect, destructive way.  Given the historical context of the essay, this principle is particularly poignant.\n\nPublished in 1938, “What I Believe” was written in the throes of the political and social instability that led to World War II.

(43, 1, '2011-11-22 16:33:22', '2011-11-22 16:33:22', '<div>\r\n\r\nby GUY TOWER\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\nMy middle name, Joseph, is in honor of my paternal grandfather. It is customary among European Jews to name a child after a loved one who is dead. This has given me cause to frequently wonder why a deceased relative is chosen for the honor, while choosing a living relative is, if not proscribed, frowned upon. In unkind moments, I imagine it has to do with not wanting the actual people getting in the way of how we want to remember them. To “dismember” and to “remember” are not clear opposites, as “disassemble” and “reassemble” are. The “member” portions of the words are the same somewhat out of circumstance, though I still suspect a relation, if not a literal one. It is possible to remember people or places while they still exist, but it is more common, and somehow easier to do so after they have passed from the earth.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img src="http://www.columbia.edu/itc/uwp/journal/2009/tower1.png" alt="" />\r\n\r\nFigure 1. 96-98 St. Mark''s Place.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWalking the stretch of St. Mark’s Place between First and Third Avenues, I suspect that the street is something of a dying relative to certain New Yorkers. We love it, and we dutifully visit it because of what it once meant to us. At the same time, we cannot help notice how infirm it seems, and that, in its dementia, it no longer recognizes us, nor us, it. Perhaps, we think, it might be better once it is simply gone and we could get on with the business of remembering it in whatever idealized fashion we choose—idealizing ourselves along with it. This is a street steeped in rich history to the right kind of people: Punks, Yippies, Metalheads, Anarchists and Jazz greats—freaks all. For most of the last century, it remained steadfastly squalid and cheap, regardless of the gentrification around it. Walk along its length and you will pass the former haunts of Abbie Hoffman, Yoko Ono, Andy Warhol, Keith Haring, G.G. Allin and Lenny Bruce. In cramped, sweaty bars, the Ramones held court, as did Guns ‘N’ Roses, Iggy Pop, Thelonious Monk, The Velvet Underground and the New York Dolls. If you were too weird or too poor for the rest of New York City, this was home. Normal people didn’t bother you here. The stinking derelicts, petty theft fences, and clusters of demonic looking punks saw to it that your nickel of dirt weed could be smoked in peace on a warm night, sitting on stoops immortalized by the ’Stones and Led Zeppelin. This wasn’t heaven, but it felt like it sometimes.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img src="http://www.columbia.edu/itc/uwp/journal/2009/tower2.png" alt="" />\r\n\r\nFigure 2. New York Dolls in front of Gem Spa on St. Mark''s Place and Second Ave.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNow the street is something very different, though still slightly strange if only because of the proliferation of Japanese <em>izakayas</em>. The storefronts—once boarded up or filled with music venues, used-record stores or crust-punk clothing shops—now host a fairly standard array of college bars, jewelry stores, yogurt peddlers, and, for a while, even a Gap. Cleanly scrubbed students walk the blocks brightly chirping into bedazzled pink cell phones. Tourists dare to waddle about clutching maps and ice cream cones, their exposed fanny packs full of passports and cash, a telling sign of just how safe they feel here.\r\n\r\nIndeed, St. Mark’s Place has become a museum of itself, down to the snack bars and gift shops. Go into the store “Search and Destroy” and for a hefty price you can attire yourself in bullet belts and bondage pants like a punk of yore. A guy I know gives Rock ‘n’ Roll walking tours, so there is even a tour guide and plenty of police acting as guards. In <em>Present Pasts: Urban Palimpsests and the Politics of Memory [1. de Certeau, Michel. <em>The Practice of Everyday Life.</em> Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984.]</em>, Andreas Huyssen points out that this is not at all uncommon or unprecedented. Huyssen references Herman Lübbe, who “showed how musealization was no longer bound to the institution of the museum… but had come to infiltrate all areas of everyday life” (22). St. Mark''s Place is clearly such a monument, but what kind? Who curates such a museum (mausoleum?) and why? More importantly, can a place still be “alive” and yet function in this self-referential fashion?\r\n\r\nIn “The Necessity for Ruins,” John Jackson gives us two broad categories into which monuments fall. The first is the “hortatory sort,” which functions to “remind us of something important. That is to say it puts people in mind of some obligation they have incurred” (Jackson 90-91). Those who spent, or misspent, some of their youth on these streets might agree that it reminds them of something important, certainly, but the societal covenant or standard of behavior Jackson references isn’t readily apparent. The second is what Jackson refers to as the “contemporary American celebration,” which\r\n<blockquote>suggests that the past is a remote, ill-defined period or environment when a kind of golden age prevailed, when society had an innocence or a simplicity that we have since lost; a period usually referred to as The Old Days, or as (Eliade calls it)<em> in illo tempore</em> – in those days – a time without significant events, and a landscape without monuments (98).</blockquote>\r\nIn order to categorize St. Mark’s, we have to consider the use of the space by various classes of people. This is complicated by virtue of it being a “living” monument. By this, I mean that it is not specifically a space set aside for remembrance in a prescribed way. In a traditional monument, such as a museum, there is a triangular relationship between the exhibit itself, the curators, and the tourists. In an area where people live, work and enjoy themselves more or less as they see fit, this triangular relationship is complicated by the denizens of the space and a group I call the “re-creationists.”\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img src="http://www.columbia.edu/itc/uwp/journal/2009/tower3.png" alt="" />\r\n\r\nFigure 3. Two punks.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf you go to St. Mark’s now, you will see young people of high school and college age dressing and acting like the Punks of the ’70s, ’80s and ’90s. They sit on stoops, beg for money, ride skateboards, and do their level best to recreate some indeterminate past that they were not actually alive to see. They are mostly middle-class kids chasing a scene that no longer exists. It’s as if you built Colonial Williamsburg, and people just started showing up and acting like blacksmiths and town criers for free. I would posit that to them, St. Mark’s is a blending of both of Jackson’s modes. Jackson describes them—and their hortatory motivation for using the space—when he quotes the orator at a monument dedication from the 1830s, “monuments are lasting incentives, to those who view them, to imitate the virtues they commemorate, and attain, by their life and spirit, glory and honor” (92). Perhaps “glory and honor” are not exactly the right words for whatever constitutes the Punk aesthetic, but the general sentiment seems to apply.\r\n\r\nTo be clear though, the nostalgic draw of St. Mark’s shops and punks, this “marketing of memory” (Huyssen 15), is very different from the specific circumstances and needs that gave rise to the memory in the first place. In fact, they can be diametrically opposed. The used-record and clothing stores operated on the principle of artistic poverty: by buying goods from people with nothing left to sell and selling them to people with only slightly more. These types of stores existed because the proprietors could not afford better either. Now, the shopkeepers cater to and have, to a certain extent, participated in the recent wealth of the area.\r\n\r\nEven so, by their look and their “spatial acting out of a place” (98), as Michel de Certeau puts it in his book <em>The Practice of Everyday Life</em>, the re-creationists and the old shopkeepers of the remaining punk clothing and used-record stores provide a link to the area’s past: essentially they are curating the space as well as being part of the exhibit. de Certeau''s concept offers a model for understanding a place where the interactions of the participants with the space are paramount. On St. Mark’s, the re-creationists and old shopkeepers enunciate their portion of the “language” of the street by being largely static. Both groups confine themselves to the “phrases” given shape by their stores and apartments, the pseudo punks limited by the stoops and sidewalks, moving usually only when rousted by the police. By these groups’ actions, and the confined nature of their actions, one can easily compare them to a more traditional monument.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the new shopkeepers, with their expensive jewelry and international foods, suggest a new language existing next to, or perhaps on top of, the old. The spaces occupied are the same, but the new content and the new users provide a completely different set of possible “modalities of pedestrian enunciation,” they\r\n<blockquote>include the kinds of relationship this enunciation entertains with particular paths (or “statements”) by according them a truth value (“alethic” modalities of the necessary, the impossible, the possible or the contingent), an epistemological value (“epistemic” modalities of the certain, the excluded the plausible or the questionable), or finally an ethical or legal value (“deodontic” modalities of the obligatory, the forbidden, the permitted, or the optional). (de Certeau 99)</blockquote>\r\nThe spaces are similar to what they used to be, and in one or two cases, the stores are even the same, but the uses according to all three modalities (alethic, epistemic, and deodontic) are quite different. Squatting without purpose is no longer encouraged or permitted, nor is illegal activity such as drug use or the resale of “slightly used” home audio gear. The music blaring from venues, homes, and boom boxes is gone. In their place are the polite and brisk enunciations of commerce, tourism, and collegiate binge drinking. The new pedestrian additions to the area redefine the space to encourage movement rather than squatting or confined mobility. Pedestrians tour the area and walk up and down its length. They briefly stop to sit at sidewalk cafes or make purchases. They hop from bar to bar, and then head off to someplace else.\r\n\r\nI’m reminded of a scene from the movie <em>Excalibur</em> in which Albion is in ruin and Arthur rides one final time to confront Mordred and Morgana LeFay. As he passes, the land is renewed and blooms in his wake. Behind these new walkers in St. Mark’s remain fresh coats of paint, <em>Ramen-yas</em>, bubble tea stalls, and Chipotle franchises. Watching this process play out over time, you can see that in a market-driven system, the space is also curated by the users. They choose the bulk of exhibits, how one interacts with them, and even the “suggested donation” by choosing how much they are willing to pay for entrance and interaction with the space. In addition, it is they who make St. Mark’s—no longer as predatory and filthy—safe enough for the re-creationists, though I do not think the latter group would ever admit to such a thing. The fact of the matter is, that while they complain about how these blocks are no longer “punk,” it is unlikely that they would have been willing or able to exist there when it truly was.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img src="http://www.columbia.edu/itc/uwp/journal/2009/tower4.png" alt="" />\r\n\r\nFigure 4. St. Mark''s contemporary street scene.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nLike any “living” monument, St. Mark''s place is fluid and shifting, curated by many people in various groups. It takes the form and function of Jackson’s modes of monumentality, depending in part on whom you might ask. The re-creationist punks and the old shopkeepers curate and use the space, begrudgingly guided and supported by the tourists who spend their time and money there. This is natural, unavoidable, and—might I even suggest—healthy, because “there is no pure space outside of commodity culture, however much we may desire such a space” (Huyssen 19). To me and to others of older generations, it is a monument because we have grown conscious that we ourselves are dying. As we feel our mortality, we look to something more permanent, something that lives on, as this space does via the new life given it by the very changes it has undergone. As we lose relevance and fade, the space can carry some little piece of us into the future.\r\n\r\nIt is this very process that makes something a monument. Something must pass so that there is a will to recall it. The new generations of users of the space, those to whom it is not a monument or whose view of it is radically different from that of the older generation, need us to get out of their way so they can continue to define the space without our interference or insistence that it must mean the same to them as it did to us. This insistence is pure “codgery,” and best explained by comparing us to de Certeau’s “Ministers of Knowledge,” who “have always assumed that the whole universe was threatened by the very changes that affected their ideologies and their positions. They transmute the misfortune of their theories into theories of misfortune” (95-96). This street is thousands of monuments to thousands of people, and each one of those winks out as those people shuffle off. In the room cleared by our exit, and the quieting of voices insisting that it means this or that, a living space like St. Mark’s Place becomes—to new people for new reasons—a new monument.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Works Cited</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHuyssen, Andreas. <em>Present Pasts, Urban Palimpsests and the Politics of Memory. </em>Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1946.\r\n\r\nJackson, John Brinckerhoff. <em>The Necessity for Ruins, and other Topics.</em> Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1980.\r\n\r\n<strong>Photo Credits </strong>\r\n\r\nFigure 1.

It is customary among European Jews to name a child after a loved one who is dead. This has given me cause to frequently wonder why a deceased relative is chosen for the honor, while choosing a living relative is, if not proscribed, frowned upon. In unkind moments, I imagine it has to do with not wanting the actual people getting in the way of how we want to remember them. To “dismember” and to “remember” are not clear opposites, as “disassemble” and “reassemble” are. The “member” portions of the words are the same somewhat out of circumstance, though I still suspect a relation, if not a literal one. It is possible to remember people or places while they still exist, but it is more common, and somehow easier to do so after they have passed from the earth.\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img src="http://www.columbia.edu/itc/uwp/journal/2009/tower1.png" alt="" />\r\n\r\nFigure 1. 96-98 St. Mark''s Place.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWalking the stretch of St. Mark’s Place between First and Third Avenues, I suspect that the street is something of a dying relative to certain New Yorkers. We love it, and we dutifully visit it because of what it once meant to us. At the same time, we cannot help notice how infirm it seems, and that, in its dementia, it no longer recognizes us, nor us, it. Perhaps, we think, it might be better once it is simply gone and we could get on with the business of remembering it in whatever idealized fashion we choose—idealizing ourselves along with it. This is a street steeped in rich history to the right kind of people: Punks, Yippies, Metalheads, Anarchists and Jazz greats—freaks all. For most of the last century, it remained steadfastly squalid and cheap, regardless of the gentrification around it. Walk along its length and you will pass the former haunts of Abbie Hoffman, Yoko Ono, Andy Warhol, Keith Haring, G.G. Allin and Lenny Bruce. In cramped, sweaty bars, the Ramones held court, as did Guns ‘N’ Roses, Iggy Pop, Thelonious Monk, The Velvet Underground and the New York Dolls. If you were too weird or too poor for the rest of New York City, this was home. Normal people didn’t bother you here. The stinking derelicts, petty theft fences, and clusters of demonic looking punks saw to it that your nickel of dirt weed could be smoked in peace on a warm night, sitting on stoops immortalized by the ’Stones and Led Zeppelin. This wasn’t heaven, but it felt like it sometimes.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img src="http://www.columbia.edu/itc/uwp/journal/2009/tower2.png" alt="" />\r\n\r\nFigure 2. New York Dolls in front of Gem Spa on St. Mark''s Place and Second Ave.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNow the street is something very different, though still slightly strange if only because of the proliferation of Japanese <em>izakayas</em>. The storefronts—once boarded up or filled with music venues, used-record stores or crust-punk clothing shops—now host a fairly standard array of college bars, jewelry stores, yogurt peddlers, and, for a while, even a Gap. Cleanly scrubbed students walk the blocks brightly chirping into bedazzled pink cell phones. Tourists dare to waddle about clutching maps and ice cream cones, their exposed fanny packs full of passports and cash, a telling sign of just how safe they feel here.\r\n\r\nIndeed, St. Mark’s Place has become a museum of itself, down to the snack bars and gift shops. Go into the store “Search and Destroy” and for a hefty price you can attire yourself in bullet belts and bondage pants like a punk of yore. A guy I know gives Rock ‘n’ Roll walking tours, so there is even a tour guide and plenty of police acting as guards. In <em>Present Pasts: Urban Palimpsests and the Politics of Memory [1. de Certeau, Michel. <em>The Practice of Everyday Life.</em> Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984.]</em>, Andreas Huyssen points out that this is not at all uncommon or unprecedented. Huyssen references Herman Lübbe, who “showed how musealization was no longer bound to the institution of the museum… but had come to infiltrate all areas of everyday life” (22). St. Mark''s Place is clearly such a monument, but what kind? Who curates such a museum (mausoleum?) and why? More importantly, can a place still be “alive” and yet function in this self-referential fashion?\r\n\r\nIn “The Necessity for Ruins,” John Jackson gives us two broad categories into which monuments fall. The first is the “hortatory sort,” which functions to “remind us of something important. That is to say it puts people in mind of some obligation they have incurred” (Jackson 90-91). Those who spent, or misspent, some of their youth on these streets might agree that it reminds them of something important, certainly, but the societal covenant or standard of behavior Jackson references isn’t readily apparent. The second is what Jackson refers to as the “contemporary American celebration,” which\r\n<blockquote>suggests that the past is a remote, ill-defined period or environment when a kind of golden age prevailed, when society had an innocence or a simplicity that we have since lost; a period usually referred to as The Old Days, or as (Eliade calls it)<em> in illo tempore</em> – in those days – a time without significant events, and a landscape without monuments (98).</blockquote>\r\nIn order to categorize St. Mark’s, we have to consider the use of the space by various classes of people. This is complicated by virtue of it being a “living” monument. By this, I mean that it is not specifically a space set aside for remembrance in a prescribed way. In a traditional monument, such as a museum, there is a triangular relationship between the exhibit itself, the curators, and the tourists. In an area where people live, work and enjoy themselves more or less as they see fit, this triangular relationship is complicated by the denizens of the space and a group I call the “re-creationists.”\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img src="http://www.columbia.edu/itc/uwp/journal/2009/tower3.png" alt="" />\r\n\r\nFigure 3. Two punks.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf you go to St. Mark’s now, you will see young people of high school and college age dressing and acting like the Punks of the ’70s, ’80s and ’90s. They sit on stoops, beg for money, ride skateboards, and do their level best to recreate some indeterminate past that they were not actually alive to see. They are mostly middle-class kids chasing a scene that no longer exists. It’s as if you built Colonial Williamsburg, and people just started showing up and acting like blacksmiths and town criers for free. I would posit that to them, St. Mark’s is a blending of both of Jackson’s modes. Jackson describes them—and their hortatory motivation for using the space—when he quotes the orator at a monument dedication from the 1830s, “monuments are lasting incentives, to those who view them, to imitate the virtues they commemorate, and attain, by their life and spirit, glory and honor” (92). Perhaps “glory and honor” are not exactly the right words for whatever constitutes the Punk aesthetic, but the general sentiment seems to apply.\r\n\r\nTo be clear though, the nostalgic draw of St. Mark’s shops and punks, this “marketing of memory” (Huyssen 15), is very different from the specific circumstances and needs that gave rise to the memory in the first place. In fact, they can be diametrically opposed. The used-record and clothing stores operated on the principle of artistic poverty: by buying goods from people with nothing left to sell and selling them to people with only slightly more. These types of stores existed because the proprietors could not afford better either. Now, the shopkeepers cater to and have, to a certain extent, participated in the recent wealth of the area.\r\n\r\nEven so, by their look and their “spatial acting out of a place” (98), as Michel de Certeau puts it in his book <em>The Practice of Everyday Life</em>, the re-creationists and the old shopkeepers of the remaining punk clothing and used-record stores provide a link to the area’s past: essentially they are curating the space as well as being part of the exhibit. de Certeau''s concept offers a model for understanding a place where the interactions of the participants with the space are paramount. On St. Mark’s, the re-creationists and old shopkeepers enunciate their portion of the “language” of the street by being largely static. Both groups confine themselves to the “phrases” given shape by their stores and apartments, the pseudo punks limited by the stoops and sidewalks, moving usually only when rousted by the police. By these groups’ actions, and the confined nature of their actions, one can easily compare them to a more traditional monument.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the new shopkeepers, with their expensive jewelry and international foods, suggest a new language existing next to, or perhaps on top of, the old. The spaces occupied are the same, but the new content and the new users provide a completely different set of possible “modalities of pedestrian enunciation,” they\r\n<blockquote>include the kinds of relationship this enunciation entertains with particular paths (or “statements”) by according them a truth value (“alethic” modalities of the necessary, the impossible, the possible or the contingent), an epistemological value (“epistemic” modalities of the certain, the excluded the plausible or the questionable), or finally an ethical or legal value (“deodontic” modalities of the obligatory, the forbidden, the permitted, or the optional). (de Certeau 99)</blockquote>\r\nThe spaces are similar to what they used to be, and in one or two cases, the stores are even the same, but the uses according to all three modalities (alethic, epistemic, and deodontic) are quite different. Squatting without purpose is no longer encouraged or permitted, nor is illegal activity such as drug use or the resale of “slightly used” home audio gear. The music blaring from venues, homes, and boom boxes is gone. In their place are the polite and brisk enunciations of commerce, tourism, and collegiate binge drinking. The new pedestrian additions to the area redefine the space to encourage movement rather than squatting or confined mobility. Pedestrians tour the area and walk up and down its length. They briefly stop to sit at sidewalk cafes or make purchases. They hop from bar to bar, and then head off to someplace else.\r\n\r\nI’m reminded of a scene from the movie <em>Excalibur</em> in which Albion is in ruin and Arthur rides one final time to confront Mordred and Morgana LeFay. As he passes, the land is renewed and blooms in his wake. Behind these new walkers in St. Mark’s remain fresh coats of paint, <em>Ramen-yas</em>, bubble tea stalls, and Chipotle franchises. Watching this process play out over time, you can see that in a market-driven system, the space is also curated by the users. They choose the bulk of exhibits, how one interacts with them, and even the “suggested donation” by choosing how much they are willing to pay for entrance and interaction with the space. In addition, it is they who make St. Mark’s—no longer as predatory and filthy—safe enough for the re-creationists, though I do not think the latter group would ever admit to such a thing. The fact of the matter is, that while they complain about how these blocks are no longer “punk,” it is unlikely that they would have been willing or able to exist there when it truly was.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img src="http://www.columbia.edu/itc/uwp/journal/2009/tower4.png" alt="" />\r\n\r\nFigure 4. St. Mark''s contemporary street scene.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nLike any “living” monument, St. Mark''s place is fluid and shifting, curated by many people in various groups. It takes the form and function of Jackson’s modes of monumentality, depending in part on whom you might ask. The re-creationist punks and the old shopkeepers curate and use the space, begrudgingly guided and supported by the tourists who spend their time and money there. This is natural, unavoidable, and—might I even suggest—healthy, because “there is no pure space outside of commodity culture, however much we may desire such a space” (Huyssen 19). To me and to others of older generations, it is a monument because we have grown conscious that we ourselves are dying. As we feel our mortality, we look to something more permanent, something that lives on, as this space does via the new life given it by the very changes it has undergone. As we lose relevance and fade, the space can carry some little piece of us into the future.\r\n\r\nIt is this very process that makes something a monument. Something must pass so that there is a will to recall it. The new generations of users of the space, those to whom it is not a monument or whose view of it is radically different from that of the older generation, need us to get out of their way so they can continue to define the space without our interference or insistence that it must mean the same to them as it did to us. This insistence is pure “codgery,” and best explained by comparing us to de Certeau’s “Ministers of Knowledge,” who “have always assumed that the whole universe was threatened by the very changes that affected their ideologies and their positions. They transmute the misfortune of their theories into theories of misfortune” (95-96). This street is thousands of monuments to thousands of people, and each one of those winks out as those people shuffle off. In the room cleared by our exit, and the quieting of voices insisting that it means this or that, a living space like St. Mark’s Place becomes—to new people for new reasons—a new monument.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Works Cited</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHuyssen, Andreas. <em>Present Pasts, Urban Palimpsests and the Politics of Memory. </em>Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1946.\r\n\r\nJackson, John Brinckerhoff. <em>The Necessity for Ruins, and other Topics.</em> Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1980.\r\n\r\n<strong>Photo Credits </strong>\r\n\r\nFigure 1.

(203, 5, '2011-12-17 03:53:32', '2011-12-17 03:53:32', 'Accelerating globalization over the last half century has granted developing countries steadily increasing access to the medicines and healthcare practices of the first world. As the market for medications has expanded, however, so too has the pool of prospective subjects for clinical trials—and pharmaceutical researchers have leapt to take advantage of them (Glickman 816). The resulting surge in human-subject trials taking place in developing countries (especially those of Eastern Europe and Africa) has generated considerable concern among ethicists, medical professionals, and social commentators. They warn of the potential of first-world medical researchers to exploit the rights of vulnerable participants given the wide disparities that exist in education and healthcare between these countries and those of the developed world (Killen et al. 214). In particular, controversy has centered on the ethics of using a placebo control-group in which one group of participants receives a placebo (pharmaceutically inert substance) for their illness despite the existence of a medication shown to be therapeutically successful (Lau 192). In other words, researchers deny a group of subjects access to the best known treatment. Recent revisions to the Declaration of Helsinki, published by the World Medical Association and widely regarded as the governing document for research involving human subjects (Angell, "Ethics of Clinical Research" 847), have fueled a debate (that is poorly publicized outside of the medical community) on the role of the placebo in clinical trials in developing countries.\r\n\r\nIn this debate, as in all debates of medical ethics, we lay people have what Robert M. Veatch, Professor of Medical Ethics at Georgetown University, describes as a "critical role." It is we who must select and revise "an ethical theory and other components of an evaluative framework" (4) to apply to clinical research. By examining some of the complex issues involved in discussions of globalized clinical trials, we can develop an informed perspective on which to base such important decisions. This essay first outlines the main issues in this particular debate (the use of the placebo, and the concept of the standard of care), and then focuses on one series of clinical trials in particular, which will enable us to draw out the main ethical conflicts around which the debate centers. In that critical role of the lay person, I ultimately argue that placebo use is unethical when alternative trial methods exist that do not breach a harmonized code of ethics for international clinical research.\r\n\r\nThe placebo, a pharmaceutically inert substance (typically a sugar pill), is the clinical researcher''s analogue to the scientist''s control experiment. To prove a new treatment effective above and beyond the psychological results of a simple belief in the drug''s ability to cure, a researcher will compare the experimental treatment''s results for an illness with those obtained from the placebo. The placebo-controlled trial "is widely regarded as the gold standard for testing the efficacy of new treatments" (Miller 707) and its use is based on the ethical concept of <em>equipoise</em>. Equipoise is "a genuine state of uncertainty about which of the two treatments of a clinical trial has a better efficacy" (Lau 194), and is considered a necessary condition if a clinical trial will use placebos. When there is no known effective treatment, a new drug might produce better, worse, or the same results as no treatment (the placebo) and so there is no ethical conflict in trials where this equipoise is present. If, on the other hand, a therapeutic treatment already exists, then equipoise is no longer present and the trial becomes subject to conflicting ethical standpoints. Whilst "regulatory standards and codes of ethics differ in their guidance concerning placebo-controlled trials when standard, effective treatments exist" (Miller 708), the current (2008) revision of the Declaration of Helsinki states in Provision 32 that "effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested against those of the best current proven intervention" (World Medical Association 2008).\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of Helsinki argues that all research participants should be entitled to a "standard of care," a term which the medical community borrows from tort law, and is defined as the "degree of attentiveness, caution, and prudence that a reasonable person in the circumstances would exercise" (USLegal). In medical practice, achieving the standard of care has come to mean that physicians must prescribe their patients the best available treatment in fulfilling their obligation to provide the best possible care for that patients. As new drugs are proven more effective for any given illness, the standard of care for that illness increases accordingly. When physicians acting as clinical researchers fail to offer the standard of care by offering a placebo instead, they break their commitment to their patients by denying them the right to proven treatment (Miller 709); in deceiving them about what their treatment actually is (or rather, isn''t) they fail to uphold their patients'' right to be fully informed.\r\n\r\nAn example of research that has highlighted the ethical tension between the use of the placebo and the standard of care is the series of clinical trials that took place in Africa, predominantly in the later 1990s, that examined interventions designed to prevent perinatal (mother-child) transmission of HIV. These trials occurred after the landmark 1994 publication of the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) Study 076, a randomized, controlled trial that showed that the antiretroviral drug zidovudine "reduced mother-to-infant transmission [of HIV] by approximately two-thirds, with minimal short-term toxic effects" (National Institutes for Health). In developed countries, the zidovudine treatment thus became (and remains today) the minimum standard of care for HIV-positive pregnant women (Buckley 250). Crucially, however, the potential of the drug in developing countries and especially in sub-Saharan Africa remains unrealized "primarily because of the drug''s exorbitant cost" (Laurie 853). The controversial trials, involving over 17,000 women, were all attempting to develop an equally efficient and yet cheaper substitute for zidovudine, so that a more universally available treatment might be found. It is not the worthiness of this goal, but rather the method by which these trials determined the relative efficacy of different treatments that has stimulated debate: as placebo-controlled trials, they necessarily incorporated control groups of mothers deliberately given no effective treatment <em>despite the existence of therapeutically proven treatment</em>.\r\n\r\nAlthough it may be true that these women would not have received any treatment had they not been involved in the trial, it is equally true that "investigators assume broad responsibility for the welfare of the subjects they enroll in their studies" (Angell, "Investigators'' Responsibilities" 969) and, from a lay person''s perspective, the apparent disregard on the part of the researchers for the best interests of <em>all</em> their human subjects seems unethical. Investigators, however, have upheld the view that research in developing countries should be held to different standards from those which govern research in the developed world. In defending their research, their arguments necessarily center around the problem for which a universal notion of the standard of care presents. Many have asserted that investigators have no obligation to provide better care for human subjects than that which "is generally available in the community from which the subjects are drawn" (Angell, "Investigators'' Responsibilities" 967). This distinction, given that "hospital and clinic infrastructure, treatment choices, and quality of care vary widely from country to country" (Glickman 819) implies that the standard of care is different in every country and legitimizes placebo-controlled trials in developing countries on the grounds that the standard of care in these countries is typically no better than a placebo. In support of this view, Dr. Nicholas Meda, an epidemiologist from Burkina Faso, stated at a conference of European medical ethicists in 2002 that "in communities where there is no access to treatment of any sort, the concept of best available treatment (as defined by rich countries) is meaningless" (Richards 796).\r\n\r\nThis idea of a varying standard of care is further justified when one takes into account not only the different availability of treatment in the developing world, but also the vastly different interests these regions have in ongoing clinical research. Thus it is argued that "health research in poor countries should be designed and conducted pragmatically, taking into account local health needs and priorities" (Richards 796). This argument follows the same logic as the World Health Organization panel that approved the controversial zidovudine trials, stating "placebo-controlled trials offer the best option for a rapid and scientifically valid assessment of alternative antiretroviral drug regimens" (World Health Organization), and emphasizing the need for a rapid solution for the HIV epidemic. Strict interpretation of the Declaration of Helsinki could potentially make research too expensive to carry out, and thus stifle efforts to improve treatment options for devastating illnesses such as HIV/AIDS or tuberculosis. In the broader interest of society, therefore, placebo control groups are ethically acceptable, particularly given the huge potential benefits that research may bring for the developing world.\r\n\r\nWhat these rationalizations reveal, as doctors Peter Lurie and Sidney Wolfe of the Public Citizen''s Health Research Group (a political lobby group based in Washington) have pointed out, is a "fundamental misunderstanding of the concept of the standard of care" (Lurie 854). The concept of a standard of care is based on the most advanced medicine available to benefit humanity, not on the economic ability or inability of those in developing countries to afford the prices set by drug manufacturers. If the standard of care is accepted to vary between the developed and the developing world, or between one country and another, then why should they not also vary within a country or even a single city? The acceptance of an inconsistent standard of care inevitably leads to inconsistent standards for research. As the regulatory environment surrounding the use of human subjects in clinical trials becomes increasingly bureaucratic and expensive (Glickman 817), the incentive to use as research subjects those with the least access to health care increases. Just as weak labor laws encourage a "race to the bottom" by prompting firms to seek to outsource production to countries with the lowest wages, weak ethical oversight of clinical trials lead to a "race to the bottom" by rewarding drug companies for exploiting human subjects in developing countries with cheap research. What follows is that "the abominable state of health care in [developing] countries can be used to justify studies that could never pass ethical muster" in the developed world (Lurie 855).\r\n\r\nHere, the perspective of the lay person―independent of any particular vested interest in medical research―becomes vitally important. The most pressing issue should not be one of medical technicality, but one of Veatch''s "ethical frameworks": how valuable does the lay person find an irreducible ethical code for clinical research, and how strongly does the lay person believe in a universal standard of care? If we apply a standard of ethics that is based on the economic circumstances of a region, then we might accept that those in a poor neighborhood are less entitled to treatment than those in a richer neighborhood. An ethical framework that rejects this relativism must also uphold a universal standard of care. Indeed, one of the primary reasons why ethical codes for medicine (such as that which requires physicians to treat their patients to the best of their ability) place such a strong emphasis on the universality of their application is to combat the temptation for medical researchers to subordinate their subjects'' welfare to that of medical progress. With the most altruistic of intentions (e.g. reducing the expense of HIV/AIDS medication), researchers might "find themselves slipping across a line that prohibits treating human subjects as a means to an end" (Angell, "Ethics of Clinical Research" 847).\r\n\r\nYet one could ask why the use of human subjects as a means to an end is ethically prohibited. Who gets to defines the boundaries of what is (and is not) ethical for clinical research on humans? Currently, ethicists of the developed world in organizations such as the WHO and the WMA have the most influence, leading at least one, Dr. Ruth Macklin, a professor of bioethics at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, to use the term "ethical imperialism" (188) to criticize developed countries for imposing their ethical frameworks on developing nations. Whilst first-world nations might be justified in setting guidelines for trials and scientists in their own "developed" world, research originating in, and carried out by, scientists from Africa, Latin America, of Eastern Europe should be guided by the universal "principle of justice that says: ''Treat like cases alike and different cases differently''" (210).\r\n\r\nThe idea here is that those working in the developing world should have greater flexibility to define ethical frameworks relative to their own cultural and healthcare needs. The problem with this method, a problem which undermines the framework insisting on a universal standard of care, is in distinguishing how two cases are alike or different. Proponents of the zidovudine trials believed that they were different from similar trials in developed countries because they were founded on inherently different risk-benefit opportunities (i.e. the potential to stem an epidemic such as HIV) and cultural motives on behalf of the researchers. Opponents believed that regardless of who was carrying out the research, the trials were like any other trial involving human subjects and thus governed by the Declaration of Helsinki''s ethical requirements. Ultimately, we must recognize that "to get beyond relativism is not to embrace ethical imperialism" (Macklin 273). Upholding the sanctity of the human being, as acknowledged in the ethical and medical precepts of the developed world and embodied in the concept of a universal standard of care, means that research should accommodate the cultural and healthcare needs of the developing world.\r\n\r\nFinally, those who attempt to skirt around the fundamental ethical quandary of placebo-controlled trials by suggesting that the greater responsibility of researchers is not for their individual human subjects but for the greater needs of society ignore the existence of viable alternatives. Research need not be stifled simply because placebo-controlled groups are deemed unethical in cases where effective treatment exists. Indeed, from a scientific perspective, active-controlled trials (in which a new medication is compared to the existing standard of care)―provided that reasonable doubt exists amongst researchers as to the relative efficacy of the two drugs―avoid the ethical problems of a placebo and enable research that meets the requirements of equipoise. As zidovudine and other drugs with high retail value are "usually made available free of charge by the manufacturer for use in clinical trials" (Lurie and Wolfe 854), excessive cost is not a compelling objection. Active-controlled trials therefore have the advantage of being both ethically acceptable and, for the multi-billion dollar pharmaceutical industry in which each of the largest twenty companies alone invested over one billion dollars into research in 2007 (Med Ad), economically feasible. Furthermore, there is a growing consensus within the sphere of clinical research that active-controlled trials are "scientifically preferable" (Weijer 306) to placebo-controlled studies. Instead of seeking to determine whether the experimental treatment is "better than nothing," clinical trials should test whether it is superior to or equivalent in efficacy to standard treatment which already has been proven effective (Rothman and Michels 849).\r\n\r\nThe active-controlled trial emerges as a solution compatible with both the need for trials with massive potential benefits for society to be carried out in developing countries, and the ethical framework that we as lay persons must impose on medical research wherever that research might take place. Ultimately the greatest problem is summed up by Dr. Peter Piot, former Executive Director of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, in a letter to the editor of the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>: "The real double standard lies not in the way trials are being conducted, but in the inequity in access to medicines in different countries." Whilst there is little lay persons can do to solve that particular issue in the immediate future, a continued discussion about implementation and enforcement of an appropriate ethical framework governing clinical trials in developing countries lies entirely within our grasp.', 'Ethics of Placebo-Controlled Trials in Developing Countries: The Search for Standards and Solutions', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'ethics-of-placebo-controlled-trials-in-developing-countries-the-search-for-standards-and-solutions', '', '', '2012-03-23 15:14:23', '2012-03-23 15:14:23', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=203', 0, 'essay', '', 0),

Presently, individual prisons in America earn millions of dollars from the sale of goods produced by inmates (Wisely). According to an article published by the Center For Research On Globalization:In his essay "Prison Labor, Slavery &amp; Capitalism In Historical Perspective," Stephen Hartnett cites the testimony of Shaka, an inmate who refuses to participate in prison labor because he equates it with slave labor, stating that "during slavery, work was understood to be a punishment, and became despised as any punishment is despised. Work became hated as does any activity which accomplishes no reward for the doer.… I unequivocally refuse to be a slave." While Shaka''s equation of contemporary American prison labor to slavery may seem hyperbolic, his testimony, nevertheless, raises questions about the meaning and the principles behind contemporary American prison labor programs. Today, there are two dominant perspectives on convict labor. The first states that penal work programs are rehabilitative; they prepare the convict to be a functioning individual in society at large. The second reflects Shaka''s argument: that prison labor is exploitation on the level of slavery.\r\n<blockquote>The federal prison industry produces 100% of all military helmets, ammunition, belts, bullet proof vests, ID tags, shirts, pants, tents, bags, and canteens... 98% of the entire market for equipment assembly services; 93% of paints and paintbrushes; 92% of stove assembly; 46% of body armor; 36% of home appliances; 30% of headphones/microphones/speakers; and 21% of office furniture. (Pelaez)</blockquote>\r\nThese numbers are striking. Prison labor clearly comprises an important portion of America''s economy, yet prisoners are typically paid either minimum wage or well beneath it. Many state prisons deduct costs of living from these wages so that inmates may earn only 20 or 60 cents an hour (Pelaez). Is this exploitation? As a nation that supports the fair treatment of all laboring citizens, it is important to ask whether or not America is profiting from a system that is unjust and cruel. Does prison labor exploit or reform the convict? Are contemporary American prisoners working for their own benefit or are they, as Shaka so passionately claims, slaves to the prison system?\r\n\r\nAmerican policy has always maintained that prison labor is rehabilitative, that it works to reintegrate the criminal into society through useful work and participation in the economy of the outside world. In 1816 the Auburn Prison was opened in the state of New York, operating under a philosophy of reforming prisoners through precise, communal work environments and solitary confinement rather than capital punishment and torture ("Auburn Prison Model"). Prisons built in the Auburn model began to spring up all over America. For a long period in the nineteenth century, prison labor was the rule at Rhode Island State Prison, which had their inmates craft shoes, "manufacture stained and grained furniture," and meet quotas (Garman 123). This enforced work environment supposedly was designed for "reordering dysfunctional lives" (Garman 120). The inmate was seen as possessing a "dysfunction" and labor programs provided the means of reforming criminals—rewiring their circuitry to be functioning individuals in society.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Prison Industries Reorganization Administration''s 1937 study, "The Prison Labor Problem in California," praised road work as an effective rehabilitative method:\r\n<blockquote>Under these freer surroundings... where discipline is maintained on an honor basis and all men are engaged in hard work to maintain themselves and provide something for dependents and their own eventual release, where rest and occasional holidays mean something else than just another dreary day, prisoners are preparing themselves physically, mentally and morally for the responsibilities of normal living on the outside.</blockquote>\r\nThis passage lucidly expresses the historical perspective on prison labor as rehabilitation: that labor subverts the punishing quality of prison by releasing inmates from absolute containment. Labor, thus, "prepares" prisoners for "normal living on the outside" by allowing them a rehearsal space to practice certain liberties. In addition, the passage suggests that prison labor affirms the importance of responsibility. If prisoners are to enjoy "rest and occasional holidays," they must adhere to "an honor basis" and must be "engaged in hard work to maintain themselves." Prison labor potentially instills in criminals the causality essential to outside living: if you are going to enjoy freedom, you have to do useful work to maintain it.\r\n\r\nMany contemporary sociologists would agree with the 1937 study''s claim that prison labor is less like slavery and more like liberty, or at least, like a rehearsal space for free living. Robert D. Atkinson, for example, explains that many prisoners "volunteer for work, because it is a lot … more rewarding than watching TV all day." Atkinson might respond to Shaka''s assessment of prison labor as slavery by arguing that no one is forcing the prisoners to do anything; prisoners willingly participate in work to escape the monotonous boundaries of the prison system. Convict labor thus resembles work on the outside because it is voluntary and even earns prisoners a salary.\r\n\r\nContemporary proponents of prison work programs also echo the historical perspective that prison labor provides inmates with useful work skills. Atkinson claims that "prison labor looks like normal labor; workers sewing garments, building furniture, recycling computers, answering phones, etc." Former Supreme Court Justice Warren E. Burger agrees that "if we place these inmates in factories, making ball-point pens, hosiery, cases for watches, parts for automobiles, lawn mowers, computers, or other machinery … we will stand a better chance to release from prison persons able to secure gainful employment" (755). Rehabilitating a criminal partly depends on teaching the prisoner skills to be applied in the outside world, and proponents argue that prison labor achieves this objective.\r\n\r\nIn fact, advocates of prison labor argue that it provides more than just physical work skills. Sociologist Gordon Hawkins supports prison work programs because work is "a major source of status and of a sense of adult independence." He argues that, without labor in prisons, prisoners become idle and dependent on others (87), hardly behavior that will support them on the outside. Hawkins seems to suggest that labor programs help to mature the criminal mind – to settle a childish "dependence on others" (87), and to instill the pride and self-reliance necessary to life on the outside. Hawkins perceives work as a right of passage, and a means of achieving important character qualities for free living. So, through prison labor, good qualities are learned as well as useful skills.\r\n\r\nAll of these rehabilitative qualities of prison labor are said to effect recidivism rates. Furthermore, many prisons contend that work programs help to reintegrate the prisoner into his surrounding environment, even while contained. A <em>USA Today</em> article explores a prison work program in Maryland that produces office supplies with strange state pride: "the list ... reads like a Maryland geography lesson: Silver Spring, Chesapeake, Potomac, New Windsor, etc." (Dishneau). The fact that the products cannot be sold out of state in part justifies these names, but perhaps these state-pride products also attempt to reintegrate the prisoner into his outside environment. By crafting products specific to the location that they inhabit, prisoners may come to feel as if they have an economic stake in the surrounding communities, a 42.8 million dollar stake in the case of Maryland (Dishneau).\r\n\r\nOf course, none of these arguments for rehabilitation would be compelling enough without evidence that prison labor helps inmates re-enter society. The executive director of Maryland Correctional Enterprises claims that "inmates who work in the plants tend to re-offend and return to prison at about half the rate of those who don''t" (Dishneau). Other prisons have claimed a similar recidivism rate due, seemingly, to the prison labor programs (Atkinson). Once again, it appears, from data at least, that prisoners have been reintegrated successfully into the outside world through the work of labor programs. In summation, the concept of labor as rehabilitation relies on the assumption that labor helps to reintegrate convicts back into society insofar as the labor is voluntary, teaches useful work skills, and constitutes the convicts'' presence in the local state economy.\r\n\r\nSo how can Shaka, as well as others, reasonably claim that prison labor equates to slave labor when the benefits seem so obvious? To begin, they dispute that prison labor is voluntary, and therefore equate it to slave labor. Matthew Parker, a Columbia University graduate and writer who served approximately 11 years in and out of state prisons in Arizona, dispels the notion that work is wholly voluntary: "In a medium security prison, everybody''s gonna work. Otherwise they''ll just increase security and throw you in ''max.'' Everybody works." Parker points to the complex power system at play that "inspires" so-called voluntary labor amongst inmates. In addition to avoiding increased security, there are other incentives for prison labor, including decreased sentences, and better treatment by guards (Erlich). Work is not, under these circumstances, a voluntary act, participated in to obtain a salary. In Parker''s assessment, prison labor does not transcend the walls of the penal complex by substituting for the kind of voluntary work available on the outside, but rather remains nested in the complex web of forces that comprise a prison.\r\n\r\nSo, if not exactly voluntary, does prison labor not redeem itself by giving prisoners "a better chance … to secure gainful employment" by teaching them useful skills (Burger 755)? In Reese Erlich''s article "Prison Labor: Workin'' For The Man," an inmate from the California prison system named Dino Navarette speaks out about his experience with prison labor: "They put you on a machine and expect you to put out for them… Nobody wants to do that. These jobs are jokes to most inmates here." This particular inmate considers prison labor menial and unwanted; he claims that the jobs have no value for prisoners besides the possibility of a shorter sentence. From his perspective, the work has no real substance in granting the prisoners useful skills, but is only another force of opposition to be endured by convicts. In fact, many prison labor programs do not even pretend to grant prisoners useful work skills. Matthew Parker describes a specific job assignment in the Arizona State Prison called the "rock crew," which consisted of moving rocks from one side of the yard to the other. This job seems absurd in its misuse of prisoners'' time and energy. Moving rocks hardly seems like an activity designed to help employ convicts upon reentry. Indeed, many of the jobs in prison labor programs are simply there to make inmates work.\r\n\r\nEven to those prisoners who are actually learning useful skills, the reintegration process can be daunting. An article by David R. Jones in the <em>Gotham Gazette</em> claimed that some states uphold policies that bar ex-convicts from obtaining licenses for skills they learned in prison. He cites the story of a New York State prisoner who applied for a barber''s license but was denied because "owing to state law, La Cloche could only practice his trade … if he remained behind bars." The skills La Cloche learned had been confined by policy. This particular policy, practiced by many states in America, renders any skill gained from prison labor useless on the outside, therefore undermining the rehabilitative quality of prison labor.\r\n\r\nMoreover, securing a job is no easy task for an ex-con, even without such policies. A report published for the Urban Institute Reentry Roundtable claims that even when ex-convicts possess some job training "most employers are reluctant to hire those with such records" (Holzer et al. 8). This reluctance among employers on the outside may come from legal restrictions in federal law, fear of litigation, and even employer attitudes towards "ex-offender status" (7). In short, employers fear and mistrust ex-convicts—they fear that they may be negligent in their work, that they will steal, but mostly, that they bear a mark of ignominy as a criminal. Even with effective job training attained from labor in prison, reintegration is difficult when you bear the title of convict.\r\n\r\nReentry for any convict is a trying process. Although many prisons boast that work programs decrease the chances of a prisoner reoffending, it seems an oversimplification to claim statistics about decreased recidivism are directly related to prison labor programs. Prison reentry policy is "geared to fail," says Parker. "They want you to work at McDonalds. That''s why they won''t let you drive. The only way to get to a construction site after you get out of prison is to drive, but on parole you can''t do even that." Indeed, Parker''s feeling of containment lasted long after he was released from prison. Despite proclaimed reduction in recidivism rates due to prison labor programs, Parker insists that he did not benefit from prison labor once released. Rather, he and others former prisoners are confronted with the same barriers and walls they endured while detained, making any chance at reentry difficult, if not impossible.\r\n\r\nSo maybe prison labor does not supply inmates with useful work skills that will apply to the outside, but one might still argue that the very function of prison industries support the convict''s reintegration into local economies. Maryland prison systems sell hand-crafted furniture to local businesses and prisoners are paid wages, although limited, for their services. Does not prison labor reflect the work process that normal people go through on the outside? Doesn''t prison labor, as Robert D. Atkinson claims, "look like normal labor?"\r\n\r\nTo assume that the inmate is an actual participant in the economy at large is rendered absurd by several circumstances. Dino Navarette articulates his frustration with the fact that California has been exporting prison-made goods: "''You might just as well call this slave labor, then'', says Navarette. ''If they''re selling it overseas, you know they''re making money. Where''s the money going to? It ain''t going to us''" (Erlich). Navarette''s consternation with low wages and his suspicion of exploitation is shared in prisons where exporting goods is not practiced. We have already heard from Shaka, who "unequivocally refuse[s] to be a slave." It is difficult for either Navarette or Shaka to imagine that they are participating in the economy of the outside world. Rather, they both feel shackled by their society rather than associated with it. The minimal wages that they are paid are only a painful reminder that they are being punished and someone else is profiting from their toil.\r\n\r\nProfessor Gordon Lafer concurs that "prison labor is analogous to slave labor," but for a different reason. He states that "convict labor not only takes decently paid jobs out of the economy; it also undermines the living standards of those who remain employed by forcing their employers to compete with firms that use prisoners." Evidence of this competition is everywhere. The same <em>USA Today</em> article that discusses Maryland''s Prison Industry ends with a disturbing acknowledgment of how local businesses have to compete unfairly with the cheap cost of prison labor and their high profits (Dishneau). Lafer cites instances in which "a south Georgia recycling plant laid off 50 workers … and replaced them with prison laborers…" and "in Eugene, the church-owned Sacred Heart Hospital canceled its contract with a unionized linen service and redirected the work to a prison laundry." What this competition highlights is the unusual economic nature of prison labor. Prison labor is generally cheaper and more profitable than any kind of legal, regulated industries on the outside. This makes prison work programs a target for opposition from companies, labor unions, and federal overseers. Therefore, prison labor is not typical labor. It incites opposition from the economic world on the outside, because prison labor does not fairly compete, and can do so because it exploits its workers.\r\n\r\nParadoxically, while prison work may be exploitative and not nearly as rehabilitative as its proponents claim, disposing entirely of prison labor might present its own dangers. While criticizing many of the functions of prison labor, Parker claims that prison work programs still serve an important purpose: maintaining sanity. "You''ll go crazy without working for a while. If I didn''t have a job in prison, I would''ve been climbing the [expletive] walls." Here is a seasoned ex-inmate, well acquainted with the prison labor system, advocating working in prison for its "therapeutic" purposes. Parker points to the basic human desire to work and be useful. Even with jobs as absurd as the "rock crew," prison labor offers inmates the chance to make use of their bodies in an environment that otherwise supports idleness. Parker may agree, therefore, with the arguments of Hawkins and Atkinson that prisoners labor to resist the paralyzing effects of containment.\r\n\r\nYet Parker claims that the merits of prison labor are utterly confined within the prison. While locked up, many inmates want to work – not to better themselves, not to learn useful skills, not even to participate in their local economy, but simply to work. Parker presents an honest assessment of prison labor. Work stimulates the detained body, but does it improve, reform, or rehabilitate the person inside it?\r\n\r\nFrom what we have examined so far, the answer can hardly be yes. And to assume that labor is rehabilitative is to support a rather disconcerting philosophy. First, return to Former Supreme Court Justice Warren E. Burger, who writes (as I have partly quoted before):\r\n<blockquote>Most prison inmates, by definition, are maladjusted people…. They do not observe the concepts of work and accountability that made this country great. They were not taught … the moral values that instill respect and concern for the rights of others and in turn foster self-respect. If we place these inmates in factories, making ballpoint pens, hosiery, cases for watches, parts for automobiles, lawnmowers, computers, or other machinery ... we will stand a better chance to release from prison persons able to secure gainful employment. These will be persons whose self-esteem has improved enough to afford a better chance of living a normal life. (755)</blockquote>\r\nJustice Berger combines the rhetoric of economically reconditioning the prisoner with the somewhat problematic rhetoric of redefining the<em> character</em> of the prisoner—of rewiring the criminal mind. Of course, it would be best if we had less "maladjusted" people in society, but Berger''s rhetoric remains troubling. It seems as if he is diagnosing the general social disease that persists among prisoners and prescribing labor as a means of eradicating that disease. In essence, he claims that prison labor gains authority over the character of individual convicts. Ultimately, the process of "making ballpoint pens, hosiery, cases for watches" etc. becomes a means of molding the human being. Prison labor, when considered rehabilitative, becomes an exercise of power—a means of overriding the inmate''s will.\r\n\r\nThis is the argument of philosopher Michel Foucault, who, in his assessment of modern punishment, claims that "if one intervenes upon [the body] to imprison it, or to make it work, it is in order to deprive the individual of a liberty that is regarded both as a right and as property…. From being an art of unbearable sensations punishment has become an economy of suspended rights" (11). Foucault places prison labor within his "economy of suspended rights," and claims that this economy''s object is ultimately "a punishment that acts in depth on the heart, the thoughts, the will, the inclinations" (16). What could be more salient to Foucault''s claims than the argument that prison labor is rehabilitative? Does not Burger claim that prison labor comes to have precedence over the values and the character of prisoners? Are not the arguments that work programs "reform" the inmate reliant on the idea that prison labor exercises control over the inmate''s person? Do we not assume that we can convert the prisoner by forcing him to work? By attempting rehabilitation through work, we use force to manipulate the soul.\r\n\r\nAt its best, prison labor may not hurt the prisoner. It may even provide, as Parker asserts, a therapeutic outlet. But let us not trick ourselves into thinking that prison labor performs a rehabilitative task. Prisoners go through the movements of crafting furniture, manning sewing machines, and printing license plates to satisfy their natural desires. If we assume that the purpose of prison labor is reintegration and reform, we uphold the idea that labor exercises absolute control over the body and the will—a philosophy that strikes at the very heart of the inmate.\r\n\r\nContemporary prison labor is not the black-and-white issue proponents or opponents of it may claim it to be. Prison labor is neither rehabilitation nor clear-cut slavery. If we continue to support prison labor as rehabilitation, we become disingenuous in assuming that such work effectively reforms the character of the prisoner and reintegrates him into society. If we discard the programs entirely, we may deny prisoners the outlet they need to prevent them from "climbing the [expletive] walls." Instead, we need to examine the idle environment of prisons and reform the conditions that make prison labor a necessary component. Our support should lie with programs that both stimulate the prisoner and rehabilitate him—such as education. For as long as we continue to view prison labor as effective rehabilitation, we ignore the severe policy errors which prevent real, meaningful reintegration, and favor a system that exercises power rather than one that fosters reform.', '"Work Don''t Hurt Me": A Study Of Prison Labor And Prison Industries In America', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'work-dont-hurt-me-a-study-of-prison-labor-and-prison-industries-in-america', '', '', '2012-03-23 14:58:01', '2012-03-23 14:58:01', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=205', 0, 'essay', '', 0);

After a moment, the camera pans out, revealing the vast Arctic in springtime, sparsely covered in thawing ice. It is March 26, 2007 and over 5 million Americans have tuned into the Discovery Channel to watch the premiere episode, "From Pole to Pole," of <em>Planet Earth</em>. The visual effect is, in a word, awe; it is nature unveiled through fantastic high-definition panoramas with no humans in sight. It is the <em>wild</em>. But how does one define "wild" in a world where humanity''s influence has reached virtually all areas of the globe, whether directly or indirectly? In "Getting Back to the Right Nature," Donald M. Waller defines "wild" by a habitat''s historical continuity: "For an organism to be considered ''wild''...it must exist in an ecological context essentially similar to the one its ancestors evolved in" (547). Capturing the wild like never before,<em>Planet Earth</em> gave millions of people access to the most remote regions of the world, displaying rare species and never-before-seen animal interactions.\r\n\r\nSome suggest this series does a great service in the midst of the largest environmental movement in history. In a review of the series, <em>The New York Times</em>columnist Susan Stewart wrote, "It includes serious evidence that the natural world, however wounded by global warming, continues to be red in tooth and claw." The Discovery Channel, who partnered with the Nature Conservatory on the series, claims on their website that the mission of <em>Planet Earth</em> was to "capture rarely seen moments in the lives of some of the world''s rare and endangered species" in order to "show why the planet would never be the same without them." But what did <em>Planet Earth</em>accomplish in terms of protecting the habitats and animals it broadcasted? Despite such claims to the contrary, this documentary, viewed by over 100 million people (Stewart), serves not to conserve, but to entertain; not to activate, but to comfort.<em>Planet Earth</em> creates an illusion that these remote regions are free from humanity''s impact, that they remain utterly wild and pristine. In his essay "The Trouble with Wilderness," William Cronon explains the underlying paradox: "wilderness embodies a dualistic vision in which the human is entirely outside the natural" (97). Though there exist some conservationist undertones in its narration, <em>Planet Earth</em> creates a detachment between civilization and the wilderness, making wilderness seem distant and unaffected by humans.\r\n\r\nWhy should this detachment be problematic? On the one hand, as the dominating species on Earth, human beings are inherently separate from all other forms of life. On the other hand, with the environment in its current dire state, it seems almost paradoxical to portray the wild as predatory, fierce, and violent. In his essay, Cronon argues for an anthropocentric view of nature: the idea that we conserve and preserve for human benefit. Discussing the transcendental and romantic views of nature, Cronon emphasizes that viewing nature as sublime makes it a spectacle rather than an intimate part of our lives. Further, he argues that humans view the tree in the wilderness as different from the tree in the backyard simply because the former is so unfamiliar. "Wilderness gets us into trouble only if we imagine that this experience of wonder and otherness is limited to the remote corners of the planet, or that it somehow depends on pristine landscapes we ourselves do not inhabit" (107). Thus, the power of the tree in the wilderness lies in its ability to remind us that both trees share our common world. Cronon argues that this detachment causes us to lose sight of the value of the tree in the backyard—the nature around us. In other words, we need to care about our own environment before we relate to and feel empathy for more distant environments.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, Waller argues in his essay that there exists a "larger biotic context" in which not all habitats and species are valued equally; some have a higher biotic value than others (564). Waller uses this idea of biotic value to explain the ideology behind protecting endangered species and preserving certain habitats. A species of leopard with only thirty remaining animals has a higher biotic value than a well-populated fish species because the extinction of the leopard may damage that habitat''s ecosystem.<em>Planet Earth</em> notably expresses the idea of biotic value, but fails to present the complete picture in the "larger biotic context." In the episode, "Jungles," the camera crew shows the awesome power of fungi in rainforest and jungle environments, feeding on decay and consequently recycling nutrients. When the narrator notes that the rainforest could not survive with these countless fungi species, the rainforest appears to peacefully exist in a natural, cyclical balance. This statement has an oversimplifying effect: while fungi play a vital role in many ecosystems, they can be detrimental when humans unknowingly introduce them to new habitats, as in the case of fungi that destroy American hardwood trees.\r\n\r\nIn his discussion of biotic value, Waller argues that there has been "a broad shift in moral perspective... away from the anthropocentric goals and values Cronon describes so well toward values that are at least ostensibly concerned with the ecological viability of species and biological communities"—the biotic value (555). Indeed, Waller draws a distinction between man''s nature and nature''s nature. <em>Planet Earth</em> appears to incorporate facets of both Cronon''s and Waller''s positions, providing entertainment for man while capturing nature in its most natural form. Though <em>Planet Earth</em> clearly places a high value on the wildlife it presents, the question remains as to what kind of value resonates with the audience. Is it the anthropocentric value that drives Cronon''s argument for appreciating the tree in the backyard, or is it the biotic value that Waller believes has little to do with humans and everything to do with ecosystem stability and survival?\r\n\r\nSince <em>Planet Earth</em>''s stated mission was to promote efforts to preserve the rare species of the world, it should undoubtedly follow Waller''s ideology over Cronon''s. Instead, the series offers aesthetic value rather than biotic value; it implies that these species are important because of their beauty and raw naturalness, and not because of their contribution to an ecosystem. The ultra slow-motion camera shot of the exotic frog miraculously whipping its tongue to capture a miniscule fly does not leave the viewer wanting to save endangered frog species. On the contrary, the image leaves the viewer in awe of a predator in its most natural state, making the frog seem formidable and resilient when in fact there are only hundreds remaining. The series'' countless predatory images—ranging from a wild bee pollinating a stunning flower to a great white shark ferociously feasting on a seal—puts the audience in awe of the sheer mercilessness of the natural world. Our sympathy for the mutilated seal does not evoke a sense of anger or injustice, but rather a feeling of pity for the prey in a predator''s world. At the same time, "among this series'' many rare feats is that it often encourages you to root for the predator rather than the prey" (Stewart). What <em>Planet Earth</em> fails to convey is the idea that human beings are the biggest predators of all, that we can do more harm to that seal than a hundred great white sharks ever could. Indeed, to us, all species, including the monstrous great white shark, are prey.\r\n\r\nThough the show''s narration oftentimes bemoans the decline of a certain species'' population, it fails to overshadow the breathtaking wildlife images. However rare the snow leopard may be, when it attacks an unsuspecting deer, it seems unstoppable. Its rare beauty and raw strength and agility outshine the fact that it is on the brink of extinction. Herein lies the problem with <em>Planet Earth</em> as a work of conservationist propaganda: it shows nature at its absolute best. Though captivating, it creates an illusion that these species are immune to humanity''s impact on the world, that they can survive and prosper in spite of human influence. That there are no people in any of the shots only serves to amplify this sentiment. The image of animals alone being animalistic is comforting in a world in which global warming has become a tangible threat. To be sure, <em>Planet Earth</em> is a far cry from an environmental documentary; it is a product meant to make money by playing on human emotions. As human beings, we inherently prefer the fantastic to the depressing, which is why <em>Planet Earth</em> is perhaps more popular than documentaries that show men poaching elephants or seals drowning in an oil slick.\r\n\r\nUnlike the TV show <em>Planet Earth</em>, William McKibben''s book <em>The End of Nature</em>doesn''t shy away from the depressing truth of the current environmental situation, emphasizing that human beings have an enormous impact on all the world''s species. McKibben argues that nature no longer exists because human influence is felt everywhere: "We have deprived nature of its independence, and that is fatal to its meaning." While Cronon and Waller provide insight into the problem of our detachment from nature, McKibben provides the bridge between humans and the natural world through collective consequences. Using the weather as an example, McKibben explains that pollution changes global weather patterns and climate such that no region of the world is completely free from humanity''s impact. In McKibben''s view, human beings, despite their dominance, are not separate from all other species; on the contrary, our actions greatly affect global climate, natural habitats, and species populations. Thus,<em>The End of Nature</em> and <em>Planet Earth</em> both ask the question, whether implicitly or explicitly: What can we do about our environmental problems? Whereas <em>Planet Earth</em>overshadows this question with cinematic splendor, McKibben addresses it head on: "to level off fossil fuel consumption, much less reduce it the 70 percent that is necessary, involves tinkering with virtually every facet of our daily lives" (xxi).\r\n\r\n<em>Planet Earth</em>''s illusion of detachment between humanity and the animal kingdom provides the audience with a certain guiltless comfort as they watch in awe. But why is <em>Planet Earth</em>''s failure to promote conservationism important when it is, perhaps, just another TV show? The power of <em>Planet Earth</em> lies in the breadth of its audience. Reaching individuals in record numbers all across the world, the series lost a pivotal opportunity to broadcast the human impact on the natural world. During an environmental movement bogged down by politics and an unenthusiastic majority,<em>Planet Earth</em> emphasizes the sheer power of the predator, rather than the dismal reality that nature''s predators are humanity''s prey.', 'It''s a Predator''s World', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'its-a-predators-world', '', '', '2012-03-23 15:22:33', '2012-03-23 15:22:33', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=206', 0, 'essay', '', 0),

(207, 5, '2011-12-17 03:57:28', '2011-12-17 03:57:28', '<blockquote> "The spectacle cannot be understood either as a deliberate distraction of the visual world or as a product of the technology of the mass dissemination of images. It is far better viewed as a weltanschauung that has been actualized, translated into the material realm—a world view transformed into an objective force." —Guy Debord</blockquote>\r\nThe industrial-flaw detector, a machine mechanics and engineers use to test the quality of a metal without destroying it, acquired a novel role in the 1950s when a Scottish professor of midwifery applied the machine''s probe to a patient''s abdomen and visualized the pelvic mass with objectivity that standard palpation could not muster. After years of experiments with the innovation, the obstetric ultrasound was born, allowing doctors and patients to see through the barrier of the patient''s flesh to unveil "a body within a body... a developing fetus within a womb" (Tansey i). The procedure of imaging the fetus has since become standard in modern obstetric care for reasons both medical and cultural (Taylor 17). Part of the ultrasound''s initial broad social appeal had to do with its capacity to "increase a woman''s awareness of the fetus," which in turn had a positive influence on the pregnant woman''s compliance with prenatal care (Taylor 19, Fletcher 392). More specifically, "since images are apparently thought to make more of an impression upon women''s minds than words (of explanation, advice, or persuasion), it has become possible to understand ''psychological benefits'' as a medical side effect of obstetrical ultrasound" (Taylor 20). The technology, first used to test the integrity of industrial structures, now makes visible the physical <em>and maternal</em> integrity of the pregnant woman.\r\n\r\nTo consider improved prenatal care a "psychological benefit" of ultrasound implies that a woman is insufficiently aware of the salient qualities of a fetus (specifically, her fetus) without an ultrasound. This assumption has played an important role in the development of informed consent standards for induced abortion. Particularly, the 1992 Supreme Court ruling in <em>Planned Parenthood v. Casey</em> permitted a regulatory framework that has deeply influenced standards of consent. In <em>Casey</em>, the court upheld several provisions of a Pennsylvania statute that imposed restrictions upon women seeking an abortion. The act specified that a woman must be provided with precise information at least one day before the procedure. If a minor, she must obtain parental consent, and if married, must inform her husband of her choice. Additionally, the law restricted the situational judgment of abortion providers. The court, while admitting that "our obligation is to define the liberty of all, not mandate our own moral code," found that most of the provisions were constitutional so long as their burdens upon the pregnant woman were in balance with "the State''s profound interest in potential life" (505 U.S. 833). Consistent with the notion that a woman''s knowledge of the nature of gestation is somehow lacking, the court reasoned that "though the woman has a right to choose to terminate or continue her pregnancy before viability, it does not at all follow that the State is prohibited from taking steps to ensure that this choice is thoughtful and informed" (505 U.S. 833).\r\n\r\nThe legal and ethical doctrine of informed consent encourages persons undergoing medical procedures to make an "evaluative choice of which of the available courses of actions is better or best" (Savulescu 17). Information about the procedure ought to "enable an understanding of the true nature of the actions in question and their consequences" (ibid). While informed consent standards for abortion vary by state, the obstetric ultrasound is frequently a consideration. At present, fourteen states regulate ultrasound access in facilities that provide abortions (Guttmacher 1). Of these, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana require that all women seeking an abortion undergo an ultrasound and be offered the opportunity to view the image. Two other states share this provision once the pregnancy has reached the second trimester. The remaining require that the abortion provider offer the woman a chance to see the images only in cases in which an ultrasound is medically indicated, or upon her request (ibid). As lawyer Charles Trense notes in <em>Law and Psychology Review</em>, the requirements are considered "in keeping with the regulatory framework approved of in Casey," because they provide the woman with information about the nature of the fetus (231). Since the "impact on the fetus is ''relevant, if not dispositive,'' to the decision," it is conceivable to Trense that "a pregnant woman would want to view the fetus as it currently existed before deciding the impact of terminating its existence" (237).\r\n\r\nWhat does the inclusion of fetal imaging in the informed consent process mean for those whom the provisions are intended to protect, namely, women seeking abortions? Images have become the criterion of truth in modernity. Accordingly, they have the power to change one''s perception of reality. As author Susan Sontag points out in her essay "Looking at War," "photographs... are themselves a species of rhetoric. They reiterate. They simplify. They agitate. They create the illusion of consensus" (Sontag 82). To illustrate, Sontag examines images of "mangled bodies of adults and children" that represent the consequences of armed conflict, reflecting that "they show how war evacuates, shatters, breaks apart, levels the built world" (Sontag 82). They also persuade. The abortion debate is a social war, and its outcome is a function of the consensus as to when life begins. The images appropriated by those who seek to excoriate abortion via the sonogram do just the opposite of what Sontag''s images do. They show intact bodies of embryos and fetuses. They show that what the physician evacuates from the uterus is whole, continuous, preparing for membership in the "built world." This rhetoric effectively changes the way the viewer, particularly the pregnant woman, perceives herself and her status as either an individual or as an incubator of future life. The images attempt to persuade in favor of one "version of reality" or another, in favor of fetal personhood at either conception, or viability, or birth (Hopkins 395). Depending on the reading, the image potentially pits the rights of the mother against the rights of the fetus. Is such a task the domain of an informed consent protocol?\r\n\r\nCharles Trense is not alone in his view that the sonogram persuades in favor of fetal rights. For instance, Stuart Cambell, developer of the three- and four- dimensional obstetric ultrasound that has made possible unprecedented views of the maternal body, has admitted an agenda beyond providing expectant families with the opportunity to bond with their future child before birth (Savell 106). Campaigning in England for a narrower timeframe during which a woman may chose to abort, Campbell has declared that the fetal features and behavior he has witnessed through ultrasound have caused him to "believe we have no right to be killing the foetus that is capable of them" (Savell 107). If the ultrasound removes a barrier to the pregnant woman''s understanding of the consequences of her actions, it may also influence the intuitions of others who view the images. The ultrasound makes us all privy to the intimate events of gestation. Trense articulates the conclusion of those who believe that the fetal image does confirm fetal personhood when he contends that "those who seek an abortion may be so moved by the deeply personal, revealing experience afforded by sonogram imagery" that not only will they choose to carry the fetus to term, they may also advocate for more widespread access to the technology (240). Indeed, he feels that "a sonogram requirement" (note that he is speaking of the<em>requirement</em>, not simply the sonogram) "equips a woman with the tools to make her own decision as to when life begins" (ibid).\r\n\r\nIn opposition to the sonogram requirement, the Guttmacher Institute, a research group focused on global reproductive health, notes that "routine ultrasound is not considered medically necessary as a component of first-trimester abortion" (1). As such, "the requirements appear to be a veiled attempt to personify the fetus and dissuade a woman from obtaining an abortion" (1). The kind of information the ultrasound purportedly conveys—evidence of the physical, anthropomorphic features of the fetus—is arguably an appeal to social instincts. Specifically, it is an appeal to the social expectations for maternal behavior—behavior motivated by emotions and instincts—and thus, it actually precludes the opportunity for logical assessment, the very sort of reasoning informed consent is meant to foster.\r\n\r\nScholars have actively considered how ultrasound is used as a social practice as much as it is used a source of medical information. In particular, medical sociologist and professor of psychology Nick Hopkins has carried out extensive research on collective social behavior surrounding pregnancy. Analyzing the use of emotional rhetoric in abortion politics, he proposes that "the categorization of the fetus is dependent upon the significance attributed to the similarities and differences between fetuses and persons" (402). In other words, the recognition (or lack of recognition) of human features either bolsters or reduces the perceived reality of fetal\r\nUWP 2009-2010 (3) personhood. Further, studies of ultrasound procedures in planned pregnancies suggest that the ultrasound image is not informative in itself, but rather is imbued with meaning through societal expectations and the social activity of creating a family (Hopkins 396, Savell, 106). The image''s meaning "is not straightforward or given, but is a product of the viewing practices through which [it] is consumed" (Hopkins 395). In this way, fetal personhood is, as Valerie Hartouni states, "not a ''property'' that can or will be ''discovered'' with greater scientific knowledge or increased technological capabilities, but is produced in and through the very practices that claim merely to ''reveal'' it" (qtd. in Hopkins 395). Conclusions about personhood may hinge on objective facts that the sonogram makes evident, but the inferences drawn from these facts and the analysis of their significance are inseparable from the emotionally and socially charged context through which the information is read.\r\n\r\nCertainly, not everyone views fetal personhood as a matter of social consensus. Those who favor including ultrasound in the informed consent process suggest that the individual woman should "make her own decision as to when life begins" (Trense 240). However, the very suggestion admits that the empirical signal of a life''s commencement is determined ad hoc, or is at least unclear. Anti-abortion rhetoric asserts that authoritative, medical tools <em>prove</em> fetal personhood. Religious and metaphysical arguments, having not achieved the desired prohibition of abortion, are "superseded by the objective claims of science" (Boucher 9). In other words, the strongest claims in this emotional debate will be objective ones, and if there is truth to the privileged ontological status of the fetus, it will have to be proven in scientific terms through medical technology. Proponents of moralizing sonograms attempt to make the authority of science work in collusion with the accessibility of the image to persuade the woman and society that the "baby" the woman hosts has a right to life. Medical imagery buttresses the logic of fetal personhood. After all, "a photograph is supposed not to evoke but to show" (Sontag 90).\r\n\r\nThe jump from impartial science to the social privileges of the fetus finds articulation in a pro-life pamphlet that accuses physicians of "violating a woman''s right to know what is going on inside her body when they turn the screen away during a scan of her unborn child" (Hopkins 401). Notice the way the biological facts of gestation, "what is going on inside her body," are neatly juxtaposed with the socialization of the fetus, replaced here with the "unborn child." The pamphlet concludes that "the mother should be encouraged to face reality" (ibid). But whose reality? Surely, the one constructed by those members of society already persuaded of the fetus'' personhood.\r\n\r\nParallel to this image-based condemnation of abortion, Sontag considers the arguments exchanged by a pair of anti-war correspondents regarding photographs of wounded soldiers and civilians. The pair have no personal stakes in the conflict the images portray, and are consequently able to view the images merely as generic violence, not violence for a cause. Like this pair who "dismiss politics" in order to call all armed conflict an "abomination," proponents of moralizing sonograms too make sweeping, dismissive judgments about the propriety of terminating a pregnancy. Both Sontag''s pair and these anti-abortion activists base their reasoning on similar assumptions about images. While the "grisly photographs" Sontag''s correspondents study "confirm an opinion already held in common" (82), the grainy images of the sonogram confirm pro-life beliefs in those who already possess them. Confirmation is not argument, and contributes nothing useful to a woman''s ability to make an informed evaluation of her unplanned pregnancy.\r\n\r\nUsed to construct "versions of reality" that will provide a basis from which to make informed choices, medical imaging shares features with journalistic photography. Looking at visual documentation of suffering, Sontag questions the impartiality of the image, pointing out that "to photograph is to frame, to frame is to exclude" (90). To this phenomenon, the ultrasound introduces a new layer of complexity. As persuasive "evidence," the framing of the sonogram goes beyond the content of the image itself, straight into the context in which the image is viewed. Just as photographs bear "witness to the real, since a person had been there to take them" (Sontag 87), it seems that a crucial step in authenticating the fetal image is the mother''s real-time gaze. Further, as the ultrasound is performed in the medical context, the image is colored with meaning and narrative from the perspective of the ultrasound technician or physician. Beyond these superficial surroundings, the woman considering aborting her fetus is embedded in her own, unique narrative, her own perception of reality.\r\n\r\nFor informed consent, consideration of one''s own context is pivotal. Sontag notes that to accept photographs of war as an absolute invective against war itself, one would have to conceive of conflict as "generic" and in so doing, blind oneself to the particulars of a given incident (Sontag 82). Likewise, to focus on the similarity of every fetus to a newborn is to distort the gravity of every woman''s peculiar situation and motivation to obtain an abortion. The unequivocal rendering of the fetus as a fully-fledged member of humankind is complicated by the divisive nature of abortion activism. Martha Nussbaum, in an essay exploring the ethical implications of local as opposed to universal compassion, makes clear the dangers of dismissing details of particular situations or failing to properly imagine the circumstances of others. Even the most admirable ethical agendas can be "not only narrow, failing to include the distant, but also polarizing, dividing the world into an ''us'' and ''them''" (13). The argument against abortion (as constructed around fetal imagery purportedly establishing fetal personhood) makes two such contradictory demands. First, it demands a universal scope in order to defend the contents of every woman''s womb as a member of society. Secondly, it necessitates the adoption of a narrow view that dichotomously categorizes people as either against abortion or for it, as either maternal or murderous. This is analogous to Sontag''s observation that images of war can be used to rally a combatant nation in cases where the audience is "sure that right is on one side, oppression and injustice on the other, and that the fighting must go on" (82). Only with a blurry and unspecified negotiation of the line between axiomatic and contextual thinking can the fetal image be viewed as relevant to the moral decision the woman must make. Suddenly, there is not information, but right and wrong, victims and perpetrators.\r\n\r\nThe proponents of ultrasound requirements seem to have anticipated this inconsistency and accounted for it surreptitiously. One must wonder at the use of ultrasound in informed consent when clear, accessible images of fetal development are so ubiquitous. Is there some special magic in seeing, in particular, <em>your</em> fetus as opposed to a generic fetus? If seeing the image is meant to impart some objectively verified, metaphysical truth about the life within, why pull out the ultrasound machine for every pregnancy rather than referring to stock images? If the intention behind displaying the sonogram is to allow women to make an informed choice as to "when life begins," why not distribute biology textbooks? Perhaps the ultrasound sympathizers recognize that generalization of fetal livelihood incurs the problem Nussbaum describes as "watery motivation" in which "the intensity of care" one feels toward her kin "will simply not materialize," being spread too thin (20). For this reason, it becomes necessary to insist upon revealing the contents of the particular woman''s womb. But this is not an act of providing information as to when life begins. This is constructing war between mother and fetus and taking a side, destroying the woman''s inner world, sense of reality, and sense of self as anything besides the enemy of the other.\r\n\r\nIs it possible, then, that viewing the sonogram actually deprives the woman of some deliberative faculty? Then again, is it possible to avoid this deprivation? In some sense, the social pressure to behave appropriately with respect to an emotional stimulus undermines our ability to maintain our own sense of reality. Take, for instance, the case Nussbaum presents in which boys raised in cultures of male dominance and projected invulnerability "don''t have the language to describe their own inner worlds and are by the same token clumsy interpreters of the emotions and inner lives of others" (24). Arguably, women surrender the ability to articulate reasoning following from their "inner lives" when confronted with the expectation to sentimentalize the universal fetus. But to think that a socially conditioned response to an image that brings no relevant information to a decision represents an autonomous choice is to nullify the meaning of informed consent altogether. As Sontag asks, "are we better for seeing these images? Do they actually teach us anything? Don''t they rather just confirm what we already know (or want to know)?" (95). Nussbaum might offer a response, observing that "tragic dramas can''t precisely teach anything new since they will be moving only to people who at some level already understand how bad these predicaments are" (26). If anyone understands the predicament, it is the woman faced with the choice of terminating her pregnancy. Thinking otherwise constitutes a gross act of paternalism.\r\n\r\nSontag entertains the idea that "the vast maw of modernity has chewed up reality and spat the whole mess out as images" (97). Yet she acknowledges that to make such an assessment is to "assume that everyone is a spectator," a conclusion that removes the stakes, loyalties, and life from any difficult decision (97). According to Sontag, this is a luxury not many can afford, and especially not in the context of informed consent. In his account of what an informed consent process ought to accomplish, philosopher Julian Savulescu emphasizes that "if information is important, so too is a degree of... rationality to draw correct inferences from these facts" (17). This kind of invested reflection is impossible for someone reduced to the role of a mere spectator of images. In order to understand and rationalize what her choice means for her, a woman needs a firm, self-determined grasp on the reality of her situation. This grasp is constructed through words and explanations, not tacit messages transmitted by images. The images do not speak for themselves. Rather, the worldviews of disapproving parties speak through them, impinging upon the very right that informed consent aims to protect.', 'Maternal Integrity and the Fetal Image: Ultrasound in the Abortion Rights Debate', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'maternal-integrity-and-the-fetal-image-ultrasound-in-the-abortion-rights-debate', '', '', '2012-03-23 15:31:12', '2012-03-23 15:31:12', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=207', 0, 'essay', '', 0);

In the dream, I was giving a concert, playing one of the exacting pieces from my repertoire, when I played a wrong note. Instantly the scene shifted from the concert hall to Hell, where I was still seated at the piano but now was being lapped by scorching flames, the scent of sulfur thick in the air.\n\nThe dream did not bode well for my later ability to grasp subtle symbolism, much less create it on the page should I ever become, say, an aspiring writer. But more importantly, it demonstrated a fundamental truth about my approach to music—and perhaps to life, for in musicians these things are inextricably bound up with one another—during my early years as a pianist. It may be facile to say, merely, “I was afraid of making mistakes.” What musician, what artist, what human being is not, on some level, afraid of making mistakes? And it is just as certainly facile to suggest that this fear—any fear, but especially this one—is stifling. But what then do we do with my unsubtle, unsettling dream? If it is simple, should its antithesis be equally simple? Must one simply give in to the inevitability of mistakes? And if one gives in to mistakes, how can one then rebuild one’s demanding, perfectionist, artistic self?\n\nIn his essay “Play and Theory of the Duende,” Federico García Lorca explores the possibility that there are three abstract entities which are responsible, metaphorically, for the creation of art. The first and most familiar is the muse, of whom Lorca writes:\n<blockquote>The muse dictates and sometimes prompts. She can do relatively little, for she is distant and so tired (I saw her twice) that one would have to give her half a heart of marble....The muse awakens the intelligence, bringing a landscape of columns and a false taste of laurel. (51)</blockquote>\nLorca’s style is freely associative and almost exclusively symbolic—he would not have found much inspiration from my dream—and so his essay resists distillation into simple, logical premises. But clearly the muse he is describing is Classical: if she inspires art, it is the orderly, well-proportioned kind, scrupulously obeying the laws of Aristotle’s Poetics, or the geometry of the Golden Section. The muse, let us say, was exceedingly kind to Haydn, and not too stingy with Mozart, either.\n\nThe second of Lorca’s personifications is the angel, who “guides and gives like Saint Raphael, defends and avoids like Saint Michael, announces and forewarns like Saint Gabriel” (50).\n\n“The angel dazzles,” he continues,\n<blockquote>but he flies high over a man’s head, shedding his grace, and the man effortlessly realizes his work or his charm or his dance...and it is useless to resist their lights, for they beat their steel wings in an atmosphere of predestination. (Lorca 50)</blockquote>\nOnce again, this definition is difficult to pinpoint, but the word “effortlessly” is key. Michelangelo’s ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican may be too outspoken to obey Classical orders, but it is too inevitable to admit of any difficulty, any struggle in its creation. Fittingly, this is work inspired by the angel.\n\nIf the muse dictates and the angel dazzles, what then does duende do? Well, for a start, Lorca writes that:\n<blockquote>he burns the blood like a poultice of broken glass, that he exhausts, that he rejects all the sweet geometry we have learned, that he smashes styles, that he leans on human pain with no consolation and makes Goya...work with his fists and knees in horrible bitumens. (51)</blockquote>\nIf Lorca’s definitions of muse and angel are difficult to distill, his definition of duende is impossible. Crudely speaking, duende is a dark inspiration, culled from human suffering (this is reductive, but it will do for now). More importantly, duende does not merely allow, but insists upon mistakes. Lorca writes of an audience member who, complaining of a lack of duende in a performance, “sarcastically murmured, ‘Long live Paris!’ As if to say: ‘Here we care nothing about ability, technique, skill. Here we are after something else’” (52-53). The something else, he goes on to tell us, is duende, and instead of technique and skill it requires a “scorched throat,” the ripping of clothes, the divestment of “skill and security” (Lorca 53). Duende is a jealous muse: it demands that we “reject the angel, and give the muse a kick in the seat of the pants, and conquer our fear of the violet smile exhaled by eighteenth-century poetry” (Lorca 51). Which is all fine and good, but it leads to the question: What is it, and where can I get some?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI find my answer in an unexpected place. I find it in jazz, a music I grew up listening to but never seriously played until I had left classical music—and my Classical muse—behind. But to understand how duende reentered my life and music, one must first understand a bit about the history and theory of jazz.\n\nJazz music arose out of the wreckage of a collision of cultures, a violent mishmash of tonal colors and vocabularies, each developed in its own right and then uprooted (as in the case of African improvisational field chants), reappropriated (Southern spirituals), or simply ransacked for its valuable spare parts (Western classical music). What evolved is a singular genre among all the arts: it requires instantaneous, on-the-spot improvisation, but within a set of strict theoretical rules. Composing a jazz solo on stage is rather like attending an improvisational poetry slam and, instead of coming up with sprawling free verse, producing a fully formed sestina or villanelle completely impromptu, with nothing protecting you from the audience but a set of lights and a microphone.\n\nYet jazz demands more than accuracy of technique, although technique and understanding are essential. It is a musical form which invariably demands duende—it cannot be played without breaking rules. And while it is reductive to talk about these transgressions in technical terms, a little explication may help illuminate how intrinsically transgressive all jazz must be.\n\nOne could begin, for example, with “blue notes”—notes used in jazz and blues scales in order to imitate vocal effects and give the music a “bluesy” sound. The problem with blue notes is that they are outside the traditional twelve-tone Western scale: to play them on Western instruments, one must in fact play out of tune, between two different notes. But more importantly, blue notes do not have an exactly defined place: if a musician plopped them down dead center between the two tones on either side, they would not be recognizable as blue notes to true jazz lovers, even if music theorists declared them appropriately blue. Instead, blue notes must be sought out—they represent a vocal effect, after all, and it is the effect of a voice breaking between notes, burdened by its meaning and its pathos. Blue notes do not strive for mathematical precision; they strive to show the inherent imperfection built into all human experience, and to do that, they must themselves be imperfect notes.\n\nThe same admittedly reductive technical point could be made about another technique in jazz, namely that of “side slipping,” or playing “outside.” The simple explanation of side slipping is that it juxtaposes unexpected scales against the expected or dictated chord progression of a song in order to produce dissonance. That is, the chords of a song call for one scale, but the soloist deliberately plays another scale, a “wrong” scale, to surprise and even offend the listener’s ear.\n\nOf course, this definition is also incomplete, just as it is incomplete to say that blue notes fall in the space between two real notes. Anyone can play the wrong scales during a solo. Indeed, to an untrained musician, playing the wrong scales is usually easier than playing the right ones. Side slipping, in order to be effective, must play these wrong scales at just the right moment, in just the right combination, in order to surprise the listener without losing or completely obliterating the form. The beauty of the technique is in its careful juxtaposition of the expected with the unexpected; duende rips the flesh off the form, but the skeleton reminds us what it used to look like.\n\nThat these techniques are difficult to master is not the point. The point is that they both require a kind of abandonment of mastery: the muse gives us rules, the angel gives us technique, but only the duende can inspire such lucid excursions away from the rules, outside the technique. Without duende, I am back to my fear of mistakes.\n\nI stopped playing classical music at the age of twelve and more or less never looked back. Between my already crushing fear of mistakes and the increasingly competitive atmosphere as I advanced in the classical music world, I had lost the joy I originally took in making music. I re-found it, though, almost instantly, in the form of jazz. And if I am able to write now with some semblance of confidence about arcane and profound points of jazz theory, it is because I have devoted the last eleven years of my life to becoming a jazz pianist. I feel fairly confident that I have gone further as a jazz musician than I could have as a classical musician.\n\nWhich is not to say that every time I sit down at the piano to play jazz, duende perches on my shoulder, infusing the music with a spirit of rapturous suffering and technical transgressive brilliance. Aside from the abyss that lies for all musicians and artists between idea and execution, there is also with jazz a constant struggle between technical prowess and emotional immediacy, between muse and duende, between knowledge and spontaneity. Resolving this struggle requires hours of exacting practice; and since the most important practice for jazz musicians happens not in the practice room but on the bandstand, it requires a fair amount of embarrassment and pride-swallowing, as one works out one’s problems in front of an audience and fellow musicians. Moreover the jazz world is exceedingly competitive: one will always walk into a club and hear a musician whose technique and duende both exceed one’s own. The jazz musician never stops learning—even from the same recordings or the same songs, over and over again—and this means an almost constant confrontation with the possibility of embarrassing, heart-rending, hell-bending mistakes.\n\nBut it is not a mistake if this description is starting to sound more and more like the classical music world I left behind. The irony of digging deep into my own duende is that now I see duende everywhere, where before I saw only muse and angel. Now I realize that classical music, played without the underlying possibility of mistakes, would be as flat and meaningless as jazz without blue notes. Jacqueline du Pré’s wide, wild vibrato, J. S. Bach’s relentless, over-exuberant modulations from key to key, Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony blaring its “Ode to Joy” at the top of its lungs for chorus after unending chorus—what muse would dare claim credit for these things of beauty; what angel dare claim that his wings fanned their flames? I may not, at this point, ever return to playing classical music. I do not need to. I realize that the muse with her Classical Pantheon has no room for sprawling, messy genius, the only sort of genius for which I have any appetite. No matter: duende steps in, trailing symphonies of wrong notes; I’d rather slip sideways into the sublime.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWorks Cited\n\nLorca, Federico García. “Play and Theory of the Duende.” <em>In Search of Duende</em>.

(208, 5, '2011-12-17 04:00:03', '2011-12-17 04:00:03', 'The Winchester shirt, with its distinctive white collar and French cuffs, was designed in the 19th century as a sporting shirt by hunter Oliver Fisher Winchester. Since then, the shirt has undergone a Banana Republic-like transformation. What was once meant to serve the rugged outdoorsman in the wilderness now serves the refined businessman in the office. Through its changing functions, the shirt has taken on new cultural meaning, becoming what French philosopher of semiotics Roland Barthes would call a "classifying myth," symbolizing membership in high society. Analyzing the mythology of the Winchester shirt in Barthes'' terms can shed light on the shirt''s cultural significance, as well as demonstrate the possibilities and limitations of Barthes'' conception of myth.\r\n\r\nIn his collection of essays, <em>Mythologies</em>, Barthes uses linguistic theory to analyze non-linguistic entities in terms of "signifier" and "signified." His "myth" is the synthesis of the signified with the entity''s unique signification process. Myth informs culture as a sort of autonomous constituent. It is commutative: culture and signification beget myth, and myth begets culture and signification. Myth is elemental to the reality of its own subject. That is, an entity does not exist in a vacuum; it is necessarily informed by the meanings society attaches to it, both consciously and unconsciously. Myths are not qualified by truth; they are living, self-perpetuating phenomena that lend themselves well to social theorizing.\r\n\r\nCertainly, the Barthesian myth is inexorably linked with its own sociological consequences. Barthes examines his subjects through a Marxist dialectic. His paradigm is illustrated in "Soap-powders and Detergents," in which he writes: "this distinction [between the respective imageries of liquid versus powder soaps] has ethnographic correlatives" (<em>Mythologies</em> 36). Although ethnography usually concerns nations and races, Barthes extends the term to include classes. While establishing a seemingly fantastic signification framework that places in opposition a generalized "washer woman" and "housewife," Barthes derives implicit class distinctions from the variation between advertisements for soap powders and for liquid detergents. Ultimately, this unexpected examination of class struggle based on variations in detergent advertising highlights the relationship between myth social stratification.\r\n\r\nMyths have agency to unite, divide, and exclude, sometimes simultaneously. Myths develop in stages marked by the confluence of two forces: the impregnation of a signifier with its signified and the cultural regeneration of this signification. Myth is perpetuated across generations through translation and sometimes transmutation. This process can be unconscious, conscious, or both. In all of these three cases, the moment that one culture or subculture (read: class) takes ownership of the myth, its course of regeneration is altered. Following this appropriation, the myth becomes universal within and exclusive to that constituency. Wine, for instance, is hardly unique to France. However, when the French identified wine as particularly French, wine''s myth developed accordingly. In Barthes''s words, wine provides a "collective morality" for the French (<em>Mythologies</em> 59). The issue of morality is specific to the function of wine in France. However, that the morality is collective indicates that the wine-myth is what may be called a <em>classifying myth</em>, whose primary signification unifies a certain group of people as the signifier''s constituents and, in so doing, sets them apart from and excludes everyone else.\r\n\r\nThe Winchester shirt also functions as a classifying myth. Through the process of regeneration, the shirt became an indirect suggestion of membership in high society. The signifier is primarily concerned not with monetary capital but with a kind of cultural capital, namely <em>knowingness</em>, the possession of class-specific knowledge and disposition. Knowingness is the signification buffer between high society and the Winchester shirt. The shirt signifies knowingness, which in turn signifies membership in high society. Members of this high society themselves are<em>agents of the myth</em>, meaning they are primary actors in its "life." The refusal of high society, of these agents, to codify knowingness perpetuates the very exclusivity on which it feeds. In this way, the shirt sustains its own classifying myth.\r\n\r\nThe Winchester shirt has acquired its myth through two stages of signification, in its transformation from clothing for the outdoorsman to clothing for the businessman. The shirt''s white frame now emphasizes form over function, and as a result, it can be designated a "sign-function" (Barthes, <em>Semiology</em> 41). It is now a mess of competing signs. The pallor of its edges suggests purity, in a throwback to the days of the hunter-gatherer, or at least to the days when hunting and gathering were common recreational activities in high society. While that association seems to contradict the image of the wealthy as leisurely and unemployed, it in fact enhances it because that image is itself reminiscent of the time when men "worked" in the style of Newland Archer, esquire, and never rolled up their sleeves (which would be antithetical to the Winchester style anyway). The shirt, therefore, is an affirmation of both hierarchy and the related manly ambition for predominance in the wild or workplace.\r\n\r\nThus the Winchester shirt sign-function came into being. The style was marked by the suggestions of wealth that accompany leisure-hunting, and, as a result, wearing a Winchester shirt came to denote membership in high society. Ultimately, while the original hunting function receded, the sign endured, and society "re-functionalized" it as if it were made for use by the business elite (Barthes,<em>Semiology </em>42). Having completed this cycle of normative and cultural regeneration, the Winchester appears "just" a shirt for the same reasons that "a fur-coat [can] be described as if it served only to protect from the cold" (Barthes, <em>Semiology</em> 42). What the shirt was has been subsumed by what it now is, namely an indirect signifier for knowingness.\r\n\r\nKnowingness is the unspoken but undeniable key to the kingdom of high society. According to Barthes, "knowing <em>how</em> to drink [wine] … [qualifies] the Frenchman, demonstrating at once his performance, his control and his sociability" (<em>Mythologies</em> 59). Indeed, it seems that knowingness substantiates the classifying myth. Barthes asserts that to be French is to possess both the knowledge of proper drinking technique and a disposition marked by specific attributes. This knowingness cloisters the French, unifying them in their brand of isolation. Knowing how to dress is to an American businessman what knowing how to drink is to a Frenchman. The right combination of suit, shirt, tie, and shoes is important not because it demonstrates style, but because it betrays a familiarity with the principles of men''s business attire and a disposition confident enough to enable one''s conformity to unspoken expectations; in other words, the right combination demonstrates knowingness.\r\n\r\nThe man who understands that a cutaway collar belongs with a full knot like the Windsor is likely also to understand how to behave at a business lunch because these comprehensions are both hallmarks of hereditary knowingness. A cummerbund may be worn however one likes, but it is meant to accompany formal dinner attire. Similarly, a Winchester shirt may be worn however one likes, but it is meant to accompany knowingness. This dependency is so strong that wearing a Winchester shirt while lacking knowingness will likely expand the gap between the wearer and high society. Donning a Charles Tyrwhitt Winchester shirt, of course, reveals a particular sense of style, but more importantly, it highlights the wearer''s familiarity with those standards of behavior commensurate with elite businessmen. It is thus evident that in the Winchester''s myth, knowingness is the signified. However, within the framework of this classification myth is a subtler signifier, the white collar itself.\r\n\r\nIn a shift to the sub-myth of the white collar, although the signifier changes, the signified stays the same. Fundamentally, the white collar''s classifying myth is realized in its physical differentiation of two groups. It has been saturated with socio-political implications at least since 1919, when Upton Sinclair remarked on the capitalist connotations of a white collar in his exposé, <em>Brass Check</em>. While the Winchester''s signification developed separately from the white versus blue collar paradigm, it is nonetheless affected by that sub-myth. The collar carries important social meaning, ultimately signifying a romanticized bourgeoisie-proletariat class struggle. The reality of such a struggle is irrelevant because it was mythologized regardless. As a result of this signification, the structure of the Winchester classification myth is binary, implying both that the wearer is opposed to the average working man and that he is a member of high society.\r\n\r\nThis definition of high society within a larger signification framework is maintained cyclically. The binary signification, particularly the implication of knowingness, is used by high society to sustain the very exclusivity that defines it in the first place. Because knowingness paradigmatically reveals behavioral standards, it self-perpetuates its exclusivity. High society inherits and passes down knowingness through generations; the origin of knowingness is neither identifiable nor important. Knowingness is not an explicit body of knowledge that a newcomer can memorize and acquire. Furthermore, any explicable knowingness is deliberately obfuscated by the agents of the myth. The rest is perpetuated through unconscious, cultural regeneration. Knowingness is divided so statically along class lines because one cannot become part of high society without it, yet one is unlikely to have it unless a member of high society. Thus, Barthes''s Marxist dialectic appears vindicated in the catch-22 that sustains classification myths like the Winchester''s. Deliberate attempts to codify knowingness would derail the myth''s process of unconscious cultural regeneration and retard its process of conscious, normative regeneration. Such attempts, if successful, could result in a microcosmic overthrow of bourgeois cultural capitalism.\r\n\r\nAlthough the derivation of such class distinction from a shirt is perhaps unsettling, it is not surprising. Fashion breeds mythology, especially classification myths. Specifically, items like the Winchester are significant because they represent the perpetual attempts by cloistered communities to grasp the vestiges of intra-class nepotism, in this case conveniently disguised as fashion, while appearing politically correct. As with any consciously rendered explanation of a mythology, this one is imperfect. Generally, Barthes''s mythological paradigm is incomplete because it neither accounts sufficiently for consciously perpetuated myths nor provides a way to distinguish them from comparably organic ones. It is, therefore, an inadequate framework for analyzing the Winchester myth, which is consciously perpetuated by its constituents and unconsciously perpetuated by society at large through stereotypes about wealth and notions of class distinction. Such a complex network of regenerative sources for one myth exceeds the limitations of Barthes''s concept. That said, the application of linguistic theory to non-linguistic entities astutely acknowledges the centrality of language to both conscious and unconscious societal dialogues. The way that individuals speak about the wealthy or the upper class relates directly to the way that society thinks about them. Of course, when the implications of something like the Winchester shirt are consciously considered, whether in a Barthesian or other framework, the objectivity and universality of the myth are compromised. Myth is an inherently unacknowledged life form, and though studying mythology is valid, it is also destructive.', 'Wearing What You Know', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'wearing-what-you-know', '', '', '2012-03-23 15:59:42', '2012-03-23 15:59:42', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=208', 0, 'essay', '', 0),

What might seem like a pristine, albeit alien, landscape on first glance is quickly restored to more human imperfections by the conspicuous absence of an upper-right corner in the image. Indeed, the photograph only captures the region immediately surrounding the three pillars, and is cut off directly above each. Additionally, since the photograph was taken by four separate cameras, there remain “artifacts” of the complicated process used to assemble the final image. These flaws are not only unexpected, but they also dissuade the viewer, at least initially, from calling the photograph beautiful.\r\n\r\nFrom a traditional aesthetic standpoint, “Pillars of Creation” is anything but beautiful: it is, after all, just a photograph of astronomically large piles of dust. In “Kalliphobia in Contemporary Art,” Arthur C. Danto discusses modern art that, similar to “Pillars of Creation,” lies outside of the realm of the beautiful and could even be described as ugly. According to Danto, however, lack of beauty does not preclude appreciation, nor does it necessarily imply ugliness. While the word “kalliphobia” means “fear of beauty,” it does not explicitly require a “love of ugliness.” Similarly, although there are aspects of “Pillars of Creation” that preclude an overall sense of beauty, there is not anything aesthetically grotesque, disgusting, or horrifying about the image either. Considering that the photo possesses neither beauty nor ugliness, yet still possesses some sort of aesthetic value, there could exist a third aesthetic quality, awe—a measure of impressiveness—which is independent of the aesthetics discussed in “Kalliphobia.” This quality, which is unrelated to the beauty (or lack thereof) in the photograph, is what has established its popularity among laypeople as well as astronomers.\r\n\r\nThe two most awe-inspiring qualities of the “Pillars of Creation” originate from the subject itself. First, the scale required to meaningfully describe anything about the pillars leaves people astonished. The pillar formation is located 38 quadrillion miles away. Reaching this distance from Earth, traveling at the fastest speed possible in the universe (the speed of light, equal to 669,600,000 miles per hour), would take about 6,500 years (this is the distance in “light-years”). Of course, to be seen from so far away, the pillars themselves must be quite large, and yet it is still shocking to hear that the largest pillar stretches 23 trillion miles (or four light-years) high (Hester). The sheer size of the pillars inspires the second source of awe: that the pillars exist at all. The “Pillars of Creation” photograph proves that somewhere in space these pillars really do exist: that nature has found a way to assemble massive quantities of dust and gas into these spectacular towers. When dealing with awe, it is often some physical (or existential) property rather than a traditional aesthetic property that impresses and wows the viewer.\r\n\r\nDanto argues that all aesthetic descriptions, that is, adjectives describing the content of the art rather than the physical piece of artwork, can be grouped under either “the beautiful, the ugly, [or] the ordinary” (Danto 29). The deep-space photograph introduces a complication to that taxonomy: the “Pillars of Creation” photograph is neither beautiful nor ugly, and by virtue of the subject’s location, it is by no means ordinary either. Danto’s third aesthetic, “ordinary,” does not actually describe an aesthetic at all, but rather describes the lack of aesthetic—the condition of existence and nothing else. In contrast, to be awe-inspiring involves more than the default quality of mere existence.\r\n\r\nThe aesthetic belonging to the “Pillars of Creation” is identified by its ability to elicit gasps by its aptly named “breathtaking” views. The condition of awe tends to arise from something unexpected in the work, such as in Dieter Roth’s <em>Reykjavik Slides</em>, which exhibits a photographic slide of the front of every single house in Reykjavik, Iceland, thirty thousand in all. While Danto notes that the content of this work is essentially “ordinary” (Danto 29) there is still something awe-inspiring about the scope of it, considering the monumental task Roth faced in taking a picture of each house in an entire city. The presentation of this work, though, does not immediately awe viewers because the slides are not displayed all at once, but rather are shown from eight slide projectors (Danto 24). Only after reading a description of the exhibit or drawing an inference from the endless cycle of photographs (thus understanding the work involved in preparing the exhibit) could the viewer be awed by the photographs.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the “Pillars of Creation” photograph is not labeled with the colossal scope of the gas clouds. Instead, the viewer is left wondering why a photograph of three dust mounds is impressive until she learns that the mounds, which look rather petite in the photograph, are trillions of miles tall. Without this element of the unexpected, both exhibits would radiate only a hint of awe, rather than the striking, breathtaking awe they inspire.\r\n\r\nUnlike <em>Reykjavik Slides</em>, though, “Pillars of Creation” reveals surprise after surprise, and each new photographic and scientific tidbit only augments the viewer’s awe of the photograph. The imperfections due to the medium, space photography, serve as an entryway to the story of the photograph’s journey from the cameras’ exposures to the final, polished product. Each major step in this story is a step directly and unequivocally away from what the viewer would expect from a beautiful, or even an ugly, photograph. First, the scientists who took this photograph did not frame the shot, but rather, due to the logistics and limitations of working with a remote camera, simply told the telescope to point towards the Eagle Nebula and take an exposure (Space Telescope Science Institute). Traditionally, photographers can make photographs beautiful because they take time to frame the shot, or at the very least to know what their subjects look like. These photographs never truly represent real life because the photographers have in some way influenced the subject or the way they frame the subject. The “Pillars of Creation” photographers did neither of these. The end product of this impersonal and literally robotic photography, as expected, is “not beautiful, not ugly, but the way things are” (Danto 29).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, though, the photograph does not actually represent exactly how things are, or even exactly how the camera saw the individual parts that make up the image. First and foremost, since the Eagle Nebula is 6,500 light-years away, the light captured by the Hubble Space Telescope left its source 6,500 years ago. The image displayed today represents what existed thousands of years ago. In fact, it is possible that the gas clouds in the photograph do not exist anymore. They could have been annihilated centuries or millennia ago, and we will have no way of knowing until 6,500 years after the event. <em>Reykjavik Slides</em> can confirm what houses in Reykjavik looked like in the late 20th century, and if there is any change, news of it will be spread almost instantly (Danto 24). Knowing that “Pillars of Creation” might not even exist anymore gives a sense of urgency and ephemerality to the photograph. The photograph will still exist whether or not the gas clouds are obliterated\r\n\r\nAfter the initial exposures of the 6,500-year-old light pattern, the scientists faced several challenges in assembling the final image to release to the public. First, when the telescope’s lenses were exposed, they were instantly struck by subatomic particles called cosmic rays that registered in the photographs, turning the space shot into something resembling a Jackson Pollack painting. By comparing exposures taken only fractions of a second apart (and therefore containing different patterns of streaks), the scientists were able to piece together a streak-free image. Second, the camera capturing the upper-right corner of the photograph took a much more detailed shot than the other cameras, and consequently it had to be resized to fit the scale of the rest of the photo, giving it its characteristic blank corner. Finally, the Hubble Space Telescope did not take full-color images of the formation. Rather, it used “filters” to capture the relative intensities of three specific chemical elements1. Once more, this is a direct result of the technological limitations of the telescope, and not of human deception (Hester). The photograph is colored according to the differences between the three filtered images, and in that respect it actually conveys more information (that is more useful) than the original black-and-white shots, or than a true-color image would. Modern science’s ability to transform grainy, dissimilarly sized black-and-white images into the spectacular vista of “Pillars of Creation” makes the photograph even more awe-inspiring. Consequently, the photograph most likely would not have been as popular had it been presented in its original form.\r\n\r\nAlthough the colored image is not beautiful, it does possess more beauty than the grayscale version. By trying to infuse beauty in the “Pillars of Creation,” the scientists “politicized beauty” (Danto 25-26) to achieve their own ends, namely the advancement of the Hubble Project, for if the photograph had public support, politicians would be more likely to fund and continue the Hubble Project. Their attempts to increase the beauty of the photograph might not have succeeded from the traditional aesthetic standpoint. Yet, through a combination of scientific and aesthetic analysis, it is still possible to consider the photograph beautiful. We are left in awe: the work that went into the production of this photograph, the mind-boggling size and remoteness of the subject, and the attempts by the scientists to use their work to garner public support is, in and of itself, beautiful.', 'Finding Beauty in Scientific Imagery', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'finding-beauty-in-scientific-imagery', '', '', '2012-03-23 15:17:47', '2012-03-23 15:17:47', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=209', 0, 'essay', '', 0),

(210, 5, '2011-12-17 04:05:19', '2011-12-17 04:05:19', 'As the first images of an airplane crashing into the World Trade Center were broadcast around the world on the morning of September 11, 2001, the citizens of the United States of America—from Hollywood housewives and Iowa potato farmers to stockbrokers and childcare workers on Wall Street—seemed to be instantaneously pricked and paralyzed by the shattering of glass, the collapsing of iconic towers, the surreal unfamiliarity of vulnerability, and the poison of fear. For the first time in a long time, America was relatively silent. In those first few hours following the attacks, before shock and denial yielded to the desire to assuage acute suffering, a few tangible demonstrations of unadulterated emotional rawness and honesty emerged. One of the first and most poignant of such displays was the fleet of missing person posters plastered across the face of Manhattan. Initially intended to aid in the identification of the missing, they offered an unsullied tribute to the missing people''s unique personalities and distinguishing attributes.\r\n\r\nBut in the days and weeks to come, such testaments to the loss of distinctive individuals disappeared from the national landscape. The victims'' stories inundated all faces of mass media, monopolizing mainstream and alternative news networks alike. And yet, despite the victims'' pervasive presence in the media, the actual individuals killed in the terrorist attacks—the names and faces, the unique and transparent personas revealed in the missing person posters—were strangely missing from their own dialogue. What explains this ironic contradiction? What accounts for the September 11th victims being center stage while simultaneously reduced to the spotlight''s shadow?\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the mass media''s treatment of the September 11th victims since the attacks, it is necessary to identify what the absence of individual personas from the media''s dialogue—from the evidently newsworthy "victim story"—served to accomplish. Prominent authors Joan Didion and Benedict Anderson offer relevant and invaluable insight. In their books <em>Sentimental Journeys</em> and <em>Imagined Communities: The Origins and Spread of Nationalism</em> respectively, they analyze the media''s role in facilitating certain symbolic ideologies that kindle a sense of social cohesion. In particular, the specific elements of abstraction and idealization, which typify Didion''s "sentimental narrative," exemplified the victims'' media portrayal (255). Furthermore, these elements were a prerequisite for Anderson''s "imagined community of the nation" (22).\r\n\r\nThe first phase of the September 11th victims'' characterization began with their transformation into "sentimental narrative," Joan Didion''s term for the generalization of an event into an emotionally drenched and unsuspectingly politicized fable, or maudlin chronicle, which offers its audience a "lesson" or an "encouraging promise of narrative resolution" (260). In describing the qualities and consequences of such narratives, Didion repeatedly draws on the example of the Central Park jogger, a woman who was brutally raped and beaten in New York City''s Central Park in 1989. The jogger was a high-profile crime story and was eventually fashioned into a characterization of the city itself—its problems, solutions, and even its inimitable essence, what made it "so vibrant and so great" (256-58, 260). As a rape victim, the jogger remained nameless in most mainstream press coverage. Though this convention is typically construed as a show of respect for the victim''s privacy, Didion suggests a more utilitarian and self-serving function: the jogger''s anonymity gave the media an unfettered license to marginalize her; to strip her of the idiosyncrasies and varied elements of character, which collectively account for any person''s individuality, in order to turn her story into a more generalizable "sentimental narrative" (260).\r\n\r\nAlthough no such convention guaranteed the 9/11 victims'' anonymity, and the individual victims had been publicly named on various occasions, this tendency to "distort and to flatten," to generalize beyond recognition, was indeed the crux of the September 11th narrative (Didion 272). Consequently, it illuminates the motivation for the absence of individuality and distinguishing characteristics from the media''s presentation of the victims. While the sheer number of individuals comprising the overarching category of "victims" rendered the logistics of accurate individual media portrayal to some degree unfeasible, rather than simply acknowledging this predicament, the media chose to capitalize upon the September 11th victims'' intrinsic generalization, and fashion them, just like the jogger, into an iconic caricature.\r\n\r\nFor example, "America Weeps" (Figure 1), a heavily distorted photographic reproduction of one of the original 90,000 missing person posters, unequivocally illustrates the media''s characteristic distortion and flattening of the September 11th victims. The original poster has been disrobed of all its distinctive elements: the snapshot, intended as a reference point for identification, has been rendered a painterly emblematic abstraction, leaving the soldier''s face hopelessly unidentifiable; the soldier''s name, written physical description, family contact information, and the original "last seen" statement have been eliminated entirely.\r\n\r\n[caption id="" align="alignright" width="349" caption="Figure 1"]<img title="Figure 1" src="http://www.columbia.edu/itc/uwp/journal/2009/america_weeps.png" alt="Figure 1" width="349" height="452" />[/caption]\r\n\r\nUpon the blank slate left by the erasure of an individual victim''s identity, the "character" of the September 11th victims as a group could easily be fabricated. Didion notes that, in fashioning such a character into a sentimental narrative, "crimes are universally understood to be news to the extent that they offer, however erroneously, a story, a lesson, a high concept" (255). In light of this, she attributes the jogger''s popularity as a newsworthy story to the situation''s dramatic contrasts—to the attention accorded the comparison of the white, upper-middle class, Ivy League jogger with the low-income, minority, and delinquent qualities attributed to her alleged adolescent attackers. The September 11th victims were similarly portrayed as embodying just such a "superior class" in relation to their attackers, and this superiority provided potent momentum for the sentimental narrative (Didion 271).\r\n\r\nThe press coverage surrounding "America Weeps," one of over 400 photographic interpretations of the missing person posters that comprise a traveling exhibit entitled <em>Missing: Last Seen at the World Trade Center on September 11th 2001</em>, clearly illustrates the implied preeminence in the victims'' characterization. <em>The Times-Herald Tribune</em> claimed that the exhibit posters "still denote hope," the<em> Los Angeles Times</em> proffered that they put a "new face on September 11th," while the Oklahoma Gazette noted in one headline that "art evolves from NY tragedy" (Mesoamerica). The exhibit''s sponsor, Mesoamerica, proclaimed that it was, "not a lament for lives lost, as much as a tribute to lives lived. The people in the fliers touched the lives of others. They inspired people who refused to give up hope. They should inspire us to see the affect we have on those whose lives we touch everyday" (Mesoamerica). Though Mesoamerica also claimed that the exhibit''s purpose was to make September 11th "real" for areas of the country geographically isolated from the intimate pain of New York and to "honor" the lives lost, in reality "America Weeps" and the <em>Missing</em> exhibit as a whole did precisely the opposite, both reflecting and promulgating the victims'' abstraction.\r\n\r\nIn fact, all such wildly unspecific and hypothetical commentary evidences that the victims'' idealized abstraction connoted "not the actual victim of an actual crime but a fictional character of a slightly earlier period" (Didion 272). The victims were depicted not as average people, but as the best of America—heroes, models of success, philanthropists, leaders, intellectuals, and inspirational icons. They were the epitome of diversity, the supposed realization of the American dream. Furthermore, the victims were not the only subjects of this exaggerated glorification. As the sentimental narrative gained momentum, the citizens of New York City as a whole were similarly characterized, modeled into a Pleasantville-like community. Demonstrations of goodwill and neighborly love—of a quaint camaraderie stemming directly from the common bond of having survived tragedy and sharing immediate suffering—were broadcast internationally. Almost immediately, a "pernicious nostalgia" (Didion 272), or longing for a stronger sense of community, for a sense of common purpose sprang forth across the country.\r\n\r\nBenedict Anderson provides another way of thinking about the generalization and abstraction of the characters in this sentimental narrative, and the nostalgic longing for community that the narrative evoked. At the point when they became abstract objects of "pernicious nostalgia," the September 11th victims became the "solitary hero" of Anderson''s "imagined community of the nation"—that undeniable sense of unity, brotherhood, and nationalistic pride that so often characterizes the citizens of countries across the globe (32, 22). Anderson''s description of the nation as "imagined" reflects the fact that no single member of the community will ever know "more than a handful" of the individuals comprising it, yet "in the minds of each lives the image of their communion" (6, 26).\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the "pronominal adjective" to the 9/11 narrative—repeated references to "our grief" and "America''s loss"—confirms that the September 11th sentimental narrative irrevocably crossed into the territory of the imagined community (32). Even the title of the photograph "America Weeps" plainly demonstrates this collective generalization of grief, this assumption of "simultaneous" or omnipresent suffering, pain, and loss amongst <em>all</em> citizens of the United States (Anderson 24). Given that the photographer, Bronston Jones, does not offer any indication that the soldier was a real person with a real family, "America Weeps" seems to imply that the soldier does not "belong" to anyone specifically. Rather, the title and the poster''s distortion, showing the soldier''s face literally melting into and becoming synonymous with the American flag, suggest that the soldier belongs to the United States of America.\r\n\r\nAs such, the image is "saturated with ghostly <em>national</em> imaginings" (Anderson 9). Indeed, the exhibit''s website even compares "America Weeps" to Arlington''s "Tomb of the Unknown Soldier," and the photographer remarks that, "The man in the flier has come to represent all <em>we</em> lost" (Mesoamerica). This statement is even more telling when considered in light of Bronston Jones'' safe emotional and geographic distance from the tragedy: he was at home in California on the morning of September 11, 2001. There is no indication that he was personally acquainted with any of the victims murdered in the terrorist attacks. And yet, he says "all we lost" (Mesoamerica). Like Anderson''s example of the Filipino nationalist author José Rizal, Bronston Jones, though not having "the faintest idea" of the "individual identities" of those involved in his artistic and nationalistic production (in Jone''s case, the victims and all U.S. citizens) nevertheless participates in a dialogue that is marked by an "ironical intimacy, as though their relationships with each other are not in the smallest degree problematic" (28).\r\n\r\nThis generalization of grief, which was made possible by the sentimental narrative''s initial abstraction of the victims, is inseparable from the corresponding revival of the imagined community of the nation. From the concept''s introduction, Benedict Anderson links the imagined community to a corresponding dialogue of fatality, to the inevitable loss and taking of life that has paralleled the rise of the modern nation. He states that this nationalistic bond, this "deep horizontal comradeship" is precisely what allowed "for so many millions of people, not so much to kill" as to be willing to sacrifice their own lives "for such limited imaginings" (7). In other words, Anderson attributes the human bloodshed of the last two centuries, the "colossal sacrifices" incurred by individuals and nations alike, to the largely sentimental notion of "fraternity" or, alternatively, to the nation itself (7).\r\n\r\nIn addition, Anderson points out that the decreasing significance of religion in society, and hence the decreasing significance afforded doctrines that emphasize belief in the continuation of life beyond physical death, created the need for a replacement belief system. Anderson comments that, "Disintegration of paradise: nothing makes fatality more arbitrary. Absurdity of salvation: nothing makes another style of continuity more necessary" (11). The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, were the deadliest attacks on the United States in the country''s history. Taking this into account, the reawakening of the imagined community of the nation immediately following the attacks begins to make sense. The sentimental narrative of the attacks, which eventually became synonymous with the imagined community of the nation, allowed the victims to be eternalized and provided this other "style of continuity" necessary to ameliorate the country''s collective, real or imagined, grief.\r\n\r\nLooking back on the media''s treatment of the September 11th victims reveals that their initial abstraction and idealization, courtesy of the sentimental narrative, fostered an emotionally seeded, deeply felt, and rigidly defended sense of nationalism—one that utilized its inherent "magic" to "turn chance into destiny," to make the lives lost in the attacks meaningful. The victims were no longer "arbitrarily juxtaposed" amongst one another and their simultaneous deaths were not mere coincidence—they were Americans, the "symbolic body and blood" of America, and they died for "our great country" (Didion 270). And, in the end, no greater source of Anderson''s "imagined linkage" exists than the imagined community of the nation, the twentieth and twenty-first century''s most elaborate, resilient, and compelling sentimental narrative.', 'The Destiny of the Missing', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'the-destiny-of-the-missing', '', '', '2012-03-23 15:56:55', '2012-03-23 15:56:55', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=210', 0, 'essay', '', 0),
(432, 8, '2012-02-27 15:03:52', '2012-02-27 15:03:52', 'When photographer Hans Namuth visited Jackson Pollock’s studio to document his painting process, he arrived to find Pollock standing over a massive wet canvas lying across the floor. At the time, Pollock was a leading artist in the abstract expressionist movement, a post-World War II style in which artists often used non-representational forms to convey emotional intensity. Pollock had promised to start a new painting for the photo session but had finished before Namuth arrived. As they were standing there, however, Pollock suddenly picked up his brush again, as if sensing the painting was still incomplete. For the next half an hour, Namuth watched through the lens of his camera as Pollock threw, flung, and dripped paint in a rhythmic trance before pronouncing the painting done. Awed, Namuth later reflected upon the significance of Pollock’s work, noting how he had “managed to free line not only from its function of representing objects in the world, but also from its task of describing or bounding shapes or figures, whether abstract or representational” (Karmel 132). Art critic Harold Rosenberg agreed with Namuth, describing the style as a “gesture of liberation from value—political, aesthetic, moral” (Rosenberg 22).\n\nBut what does the viewer contemplating One: Number 31, 1950 at the Museum of Modern Art see? Standing in front of a canvas that is nearly nine by eighteen feet, covered with a splattering of different colored paints any three year old could do, does he see the same meaning, the same significance? And why has Pollock’s work, or the work of the abstract expressionists in general, been so successful when it is simultaneously so simplistic and so indefinable? One set of possible answers to these questions can be found in the realm of science. The recognition Pollock’s paintings have achieved can be explained by the theory of memes proposed by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins. The field of memetics, an application of the evolutionary concepts behind genetics, studies the transfer of ideas from person to person and what makes a meme, or a particular idea, successful (Dawkins 192). As compared to a conversation between two people, in which ideas are normally conveyed clearly and directly, a painting is an indirect form of communication that requires more interpretation to understand. Dawkins’ theory allows for a new level of understanding of abstract impressionists like Pollock.\n\nAbstract expressionists employ a means of communication where the idea expressed is not always abundantly clear and the merit of the technical skill demonstrated is debatable. Even so, the style achieved a high status in accordance with the characteristics defined by Dawkins as crucial to a meme’s success (and, not coincidentally, to a gene’s success). The first quality is longevity: the ability to persist through time (Dawkins 194). Just like Dawkins’ example of a certain tune surviving in written form and in peoples’ minds, so too are the works of Pollock ensured longevity (Dawkins 194). In addition to his actual paintings hanging in art museums around the world, the number of people who have at least a basic concept of Pollock’s work greatly exceeds the number of people who have actually seen one of his paintings in real life. The most novice art student has at least an elementary knowledge of Pollock’s style, and many members of non-artistic circles are familiar with his paintings due to their cultural presence. The physical and conceptual persistence of Pollock’s work, even decades after the artist’s death, proves the unlikelihood of its “dying out” as long as art continues to hold its traditional level of importance in the individual and cultural realms.\n\nIn addition to longevity, Dawkins proposes fecundity, or the ability to propagate and spread, as critical to a meme’s survival; drawing a parallel to genes, memes are described as replication machines whose level of success is determined by how well they can reproduce themselves (Dawkins 194). An extremely literal interpretation of this principle can be applied to the work of Pollock, since countless replications of his paintings exist. The sense of the evolutionary impulse present in much of Dawkins’ case studies comes across here since the spread of a meme is directly related to its sense of worth or value for those receiving it. For example, Dawkins proposes that for a scientific meme, “its spread will depend on how acceptable it is to the population of individual scientists” (Dawkins 194). Taking this into consideration, the far-reaching presence of Pollock’s work in both artistic and non-artistic circles serves as direct testimony to a positive reception of his paintings. The doubting critic, perhaps a fan of classical art, must recognize that Pollock’s work has at least a certain degree of success solely based on the popularity his work has achieved.\n\nLongevity and fecundity aside, the most interesting application of memetics to abstract expressionism lies in the final quality of a successful meme: copying-fidelity (Dawkins 194). On this point, Dawkins himself is rather ambiguous, stretching his definition of the term in order to make it work. In the field of genetics, copying-fidelity is the ability of a gene to replicate itself accurately, thus ensuring its own perpetuation instead of any variation (Dawkins 17). In the field of memetics, this idea does not seem to translate, since the transfer of an idea from person to person alters its definition based on each individual perception and interpretation. Dawkins eventually reconciles this with the assertion that “differences in the ways that people represent [the meme] are then, by definition, not part of the meme” (Dawkins 196). This explanation, however, does not seem fully sufficient. In order to explore the validity of copying-fidelity to memes, it is necessary to temporarily ignore a strict adherence to the gene-meme analogy. While similarities abound, genes and memes do in fact differ greatly in their natures. Genes are essentially assigned and limited to the individual; memes, on the other hand, have a greater element of choice and by definition concern the interaction between people. Allowing for this difference, a reflection on the success of abstract expressionism offers a new alternative to the quality of copying-fidelity: adaptability.\n\nIt is necessary for abstract expressionism to have an element of adaptability. Standing in front of One: Number 31, 1950, it is difficult to know precisely what Pollock had in mind when he was painting—what idea he was trying to express. As the painting represents nothing distinguishable, it leaves itself open to any interpretation. Within it, some people see the “nervous intensity of the modern city” while others perceive the “primal rhythms of nature” (“One: Number 31, 1950”). With this artist-viewer interaction in mind, it is reasonable to ask if a painting is successful if the viewer has a different interpretation than the one intended by the artist. The answer in the affirmative provides adaptability as a key to success. For Pollock, the act of creation was sufficient unto itself. As an action painter, he was concerned with the actual process of painting, the play between what he could control and what he could not, and the relationship that unfolded between the artist and what he built upon the canvas (Rosenberg 22). As such, the intrinsic meaning of the painting essentially lies in its interpretation—what the viewer can get out of it on a personal level. With this logic, the greater potential a painting has for multiple interpretations, the greater potential it has for meaning.\n\nBringing this concept back to the field of memetics, the quality of copying-fidelity is no longer appropriate as an attribute of success. In the world of art, copying-fidelity would be comparable to a single interpretation of a painting. This form of accuracy would thus limit the painting’s accessibility to viewers, as there is practically no concept to which everyone can relate. Alternatively, a certain degree of adaptability leaves the opportunity for everyone to find something they like. A meme need no longer be only a replication machine; now, it should serve the dual purpose of being an adaptation machine. Accuracy becomes secondary to flexibility, perfection secondary to reflection. A meme able to adapt to a wide variety of people and mindsets holds a higher chance of survival. This new tool additionally reflects back on the original quality of longevity: adaptation ensures the capacity for evolutionary modernization, thus preventing a meme from becoming antiquated. As long as a meme offers multiple interpretations, each generation can find a new and appropriate understanding of it, ensuring its longevity. While adaptations in genetics are detrimental to an individual gene’s survival, adaptations in memetics appear to be a tool much more useful than copying-fidelity. In this way, Dawkins’ theory can be modified based on the success associated with the idea of adaptability in the world of abstract expressionism.\nFor the most skeptical of critics, the application of Dawkins’ quality for a successful meme to the artist-viewer relationship may not be enough to explain to him why abstract expressionism has garnered its level of popularity and acclaim. What may enlighten him, however, is a secondary level of memetics that extends to the interaction among artist, viewer, and society. When considering the success of the abstract expressionist movement, it is important to ask not only why Pollock was successful, but why he was successful beyond other abstract expressionists. In an extremely subjective style, why does the unassuming viewer find Pollock’s work superior to the work of any similar, lesser-known artist? It is perhaps because a sense of its worth or value is conveyed on a memetic level beyond the communication of the painting itself.\n\nOnce again, consider the man standing in front of One: Number 31, 1950. Not only is he forming his own interpretation of the piece, but he is subconsciously processing the external opinion that the painting has merit. He knows well-versed art critics have viewed the work before him and pronounced it valid and meaningful; the mere fact that the painting is hanging in a world-renowned museum must mean it has significance. In this manner, the collective of “society” propagates the meme that the painting is good, which in turn influences how the viewer receives the meme communication from the artist and the painting itself. The result is a highly interactive and complex system in which memetics function. A new importance arises for the memes of memes, the societal concepts inextricably attached to any given idea or theory. Such a development reintroduces the evolutionary practice of competition that underlies Dawkins’ studies. In order for one meme to rise above another, it is beneficial for it to have, in additional to its own merit, an external sense of worth, just as Pollock’s art has attained its level of fame as much from the societal sense that it is high-quality art as from its actual artistic value. In the world of art as in the world of memes, communication is not a two-way interaction but rather a perpetual exchange between various sources expressing and modifying each other.\n\nThe subject of great dispute, abstract expressionism has secured a place in art history despite heavy criticism. Often, viewers feel alienated by the seemingly random and meaningless images lying before them, and, walking through a modern art museum, one can often hear, “I could have done that,” quietly muttered. Be that as it may, abstract expressionists like Pollock have achieved great levels of success, sometimes to the bewilderment of non-artists and artists alike. Applying Dawkins’ theory of memetics to the style, however, offers a rational and practical examination of what aspects caused abstract expressionism to flourish and why it functions as a thriving artistic movement. While art will always evoke varying opinions of merit, approaching abstract expressionism from the scientific perspective of memetics can provide an understanding if not an appreciation of the presence of artists like Pollock in the unfolding history of artistic expression. ', 'The Memetics of Jackson Pollock', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '241-autosave', '', '', '2012-02-27 15:03:52', '2012-02-27 15:03:52', '', 241, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?p=432', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
(211, 5, '2011-12-17 04:07:18', '2011-12-17 04:07:18', 'Universal truth is an outdated concept. Traditional philosophers explained reality through a single system of precepts which, though often abstracted to the point of meaninglessness, provided the singular satisfaction of complete and absolute truth. Modern thinkers are skeptical of such grand unifying theories. To them there is no one objective vision of reality, only various perspectives, all equally valid and limited.\r\n\r\nWendy Doniger applies this pluralism to the concept of identity. In her essay, ???Many Masks, Many Selves,??? she discusses various historical figures, from the ???acting President??? Ronald Reagan (62) to the notorious transvestite Chevalier d???Eon (64), whose public masks were so tangled with their private personae that the ostensibly objective self became nebulous. From this Doniger concludes that there is no fundamental self, rather ???a polythetic clustering of resembling selves??? sufficient to create an enduring sense of self??? (70). The absence of an absolute identity does not trouble her though, as it validates a plurality of masks. This relativism is liberating in a world that demands many identities, allowing a career woman to change from doting mother, to cutthroat capitalist, to sultry temptress without undermining any of her masks (68). Freed from the obsolete notion of the soul, Pluralistic Man defines himself as he wills.\r\n\r\nThe Underground Man, the anti-hero of Fyodor Dostoevsky???s novel <em>Notes from the Underground</em>, is the epitome of Doniger???s personality masquerader. Throughout the novel, the Underground Man deliberately assumes identities ranging from debauched aristocrat (99) to radical social critic (122), culminating in his stirring sermon on vice and redemption to an enraptured prostitute, which is ultimately revealed as a cynical intellectual self-indulgence with no true pathos (144). He takes Doniger???s advice to ???wear as many [masks] as possible, realize that we are wearing them, and try to find out what each one concerns and reveals??? (70). Yet it is this very realization of the mask that undermines his masquerade. His awareness of the contradiction of his masks does not ???allow paradox to thrive??? (Doniger 70), rather it reveals the phoniness of his personae and his terrible disconnection from his true self, in which Dostoevsky, unlike Doniger, fervently believes (201). Dostoevsky employs the Underground Man to prove that the individual who ???knows thyself??? cannot comfortably wear Doniger???s masks.\r\n\r\nThe vestment of the sanctimonious is the most uncomfortable mask for the self-perceptive man because the honest preacher, constantly aware of his own sins, hesitates to cast the first stone. Dostoevsky demonstrates this with the Underground Man???s failed speech during the goodbye dinner of Zverkov (119-120), a successful army office and former school mate. The protagonist prefaces this episode by describing his childhood jealousy and hatred of Zverkov, a typical aristocratic philistine blessed with beauty, moral indifference, and social graces (95). This last attribute particularly vexes the Underground Man, as that is what he lacks and longs for most. To prove his moral superiority and disdain he decides to don the smirking mask of satire and interrupt the dinner with a diatribe that will shatter Zverkov???s conceit. In the middle of his philippic, though, he is struck by the hypocrisy of his cynicism. After all, he invited himself to the dinner originally out of a vain attempt to ingratiate himself with the very men whose vanity he is attacking. Crippled by this revelation, his tirade trickles into confused and sentimental rambling, which only fuels his opponents??? contempt (124).\r\n\r\nSeen through the lens of Doniger???s infinite selves, the Underground Man???s moralizing is defensible. His supposedly sinful true self is no more fundamental than the righteous persona he adopts, so the latter is not hypocritical, but merely different. A pluralistic self that wears conflicting masks is no more duplicitous than a single actor who plays separate conflicting parts in the same eternal play.\r\n\r\nDoniger???s carefree possessors of antithetical ethics are acknowledged by Dostoevsky. He longingly describes the ???rogue [who] can be absolutely and loftily honest at heart without in the least ceasing to be a rogue??? (72). Yet such innocence is limited to those who have ???a faculty??? for the most contradictory sensations??? (71): i.e. the unreflective layman. The perceptive man???s visceral aversion to conscious hypocrisy cannot be assuaged by an intellectual recognition of the plurality of self. Doniger???s ???Venn diagram??? (70) of selves is as ???Zen??? (70) as she describes, in that it can only be achieved through unthinking.\r\n\r\nThe self-aware individual???s comprehension of the artificial source of his mask inhibits his ability to naturally masquerade, as Dostoevsky exhibits again with his hapless protagonist. In a surge of anger, after being humiliated at the dinner party, the Underground Man imagines an elaborate revenge involving an honorable dual, years of stoic suffering in Siberia, and finally a climactic confrontation with the grand perpetrator, Zverkov, whom the Christ-like hero magnanimously forgives, attaining absolute moral revenge (130-131). The integrity of this mask of righteous anger is quickly undermined, however, by the Underground Man''s understanding that the entire revenge fantasy is merely a trite rehashing of plots lifted from Pushkin and Lermontov (131).\r\n\r\nDoniger agrees that masks are typically appropriated from art, as in Reagan???s channeling of his WWII film hero past to enhance the verisimilitude of his Normandy speech (62). The externality of such masks does not bother her though, as she denies the existence of a wholly internal mask. ???We are never ourselves to ourselves, but always in relation to others??? (Doniger 67), so the difference between the Underground Man quoting Pushkin versus Pushkin???s original exhortations themselves is just a matter of degree.\r\n\r\nTo Dostoevsky though, this matter of degree is crucial because the wearer of the mask is conscious of it. All ideas may be necessarily external because they are ultimately an amalgamation of reactions to others??? ideas, but they do not immediately appear so to their conceivers, even those who are perceptive. Conversely, when the Underground Man copies directly from Pushkin, since art is artificial by default, he is unavoidably aware that he is uttering artifice. Again, the confidence of the masquerader is determined by his awareness of the masquerade, not the theoretical validity of the mask.\r\n\r\nA mask worn in its proper scene can appear as authentic as Doniger desires; during the transition between scenes though, the absurdity is naked. Dostoevsky illustrates this with the Underground Man???s final interaction with Liza, the aforementioned prostitute. The penitent harlot comes to his house seeking the holy man who had lectured her on sin. Although her savior begins his address appropriately, sanctimoniously extolling his humble abode, he is soon distracted by his hated manservant and starts squabbling with him over some petty misdeed. Pathos turns to bathos, and the Underground Man is reminded once more of the silliness of his masks. Note that moral hypocrisy is not the issue here. The manservant may have deserved a tongue lashing as much as Liza merited more flowery words. It is the awkward juxtaposition that undermines each persona.\r\n\r\nThis damning disparity is not just apparent during abrupt switches. No matter how brief and fluid the transition, the perceptive individual will always note the momentary non sequitur. Even Doniger???s model career woman, coming home from a day of merciless layoffs to bake cookies for her children, would be disquieted by the contrast of her masks.\r\n\r\nBoth Doniger and Dostoevsky have their consolations. Doniger does not believe in a single fundamental identity, but effectively replaces it with her conception of the pluralistic self. Dostoevsky denies the feasibility of this pluralistic self, but believes in an ultimate authentic identity: a soul. Although the Underground Man may have lost his soul through ???lack of fitting environment, through divorce from real life, and rankling spite,??? (201) his <em>Notes</em> serve as ???corrective punishment??? (201) for himself, the reader, and perhaps even the author, urging them to avoid his mistakes and return to their real selves (210-203). When viewed through each other???s lenses though, these consolations cancel out. The Pluralistic Underground Man can neither blithely exchange masks, nor piously pursue the sacred aspiration of the non-existent true self. He is the tragic archetype of modernity: Mastery of reasoning has allowed him to penetrate the mind???s substrata of comforting delusions and fantasies, only to find nothing beneath. Doniger optimistically assures him that ???as we strip away masks, or faces, each time we see more in the hall of looking glasses??? (70). The Pluralistic Underground Man only sees infinite reflections of his plastic face, endlessly mocking him.', 'Existential Stage-Fright', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'existential-stage-fright', '', '', '2012-03-23 15:16:27', '2012-03-23 15:16:27', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=211', 0, 'essay', '', 0),

This is the breathtaking image of Beyoncé Knowles—best known as simply Beyoncé—in the L’Oreal Paris 2008 Feria Ad. Naturally, Photoshop technicians were assigned to retouch the dull, original still shot into this exquisite frame. These skilled wizards may have over-fiddled with their magical enhancements: The final edit features a significantly lighter skinned, almost Caucasian Beyoncé, the natural mocha pigment of the iconic celebrity’s skin somehow faded in the misguided abyss of the editing room. It is ironic that the same female singer who famously coined the term “bootylicious” to praise the voluptuous figures of black women allowed this digitally manipulated white version of herself to represent, or more accurately misrepresent, her black image in a national beauty campaign. Beyoncé gives off the impression of two contradicting images of a black woman: one, a proud, curvaceous woman, and the other, a pale-skinned glamazon. With white standards of beauty dominating the market, black celebrities such as Beyoncé are pressured to create two separate identities to deal with society’s questionable appreciation of the black aesthetic. The question remains: Which identity is a more positive representation of the black aesthetic, one that casts black beauty in the starkest of lights or one that embellishes ethnicity to meet so-called universalizing beauty standards?\r\n\r\nAs expected, L’Oreal denied tampering with Beyoncé’s coloring, releasing a statement affirming, “It is categorically untrue that L’Oreal Paris altered Ms. Knowles’ features or skin tone in the campaign for Feria hair color”<a name="0.1__ftnref1"></a><a name="0.1__Hlt157761264"></a> (McMillon). Even so, bell hooks, author of “In Our Glory,” would likely view Beyoncé’s whitened ad as a wake up call to the black community that “the field of representation remains a crucial realm of struggle, as important as the question of equal access, if not more important” (57-8). hooks suggests that blacks use photography to seize control over their own imagery and to combat demeaning representations of blackness created by white racists (59). Applying hooks’ argument, the color distortion of Beyoncé’s skin emphasizes a failure of the image to establish a black “sense of self and identity” (63). The L’Oreal ad highlights the continued white stigma regarding black appearance and that little progress has been made toward appreciating blackness. The physicality of blacks does not fit the exact mold of conventional white beauty standards. Rather than challenging this attitude through positive ethnic representations, Beyoncé’s image instead “promote[s] notions of essence and identity that ultimately restric[t] and confin[e] black image production” (58). hooks argues that the campaign for black representation is stagnant, and this torpor has destructive effects in the formulation of the black identity, causing blacks to simply accept the perceptions of the “dominant culture” and ultimately foster an internalized racism (59).\r\n\r\nFair skin and light eyes have long been celebrated by white society, the rarity of these characteristics accounting for their glamour. Society upholds these qualities as aesthetic ideals, and these standards of beauty carry over into white culture’s reception of black beauty. Black beauty is unusual to the white consumer, and thus not preferred when matched up against conventional beauty standards. One black designer commented on the apparent preference for the white aesthetic, “It''s absolutely true that black models will be not as popular for advertising companies and magazine covers as white girls”<a name="0.1__ftnref2"></a> (Eden). Until blacks gradually ease whites into the black aesthetic, blacks will have to adapt themselves to match white conventional ideas about beauty. Therefore, photo-shopping Beyoncé’s complexion may not entirely have been a criticism of black beauty, but rather a conformation of black skin to preexisting standards of white beauty. hooks, however, condemns such acquiescence, maintaining that blacks should not attempt to “remak[e] black bodies in the image of whiteness…[and] attemp[t] to perfect the image for a white-supremacist gaze” (62). She insists that photos should be used “to construct radical identities” and “images of ourselves that transcend the limits of the colonizing eye” (64).\r\n\r\nBeyoncé’s lightened black skin tone can be understood as a black desire to be a whiter black. When blacks make the attempt to be whiter in both black and white campaigns, they only contribute to the “colonizing aesthetic.” hooks might argue that intra-black communal rankings based on lightness of skin are “practices that reinscrib[e] colonial ways of looking and capturing the images of the black ‘other’” (62). Confirming hooks’ theories, Beyoncé yielded the opportunity to create an image promoting her ethnicity, and did not help in any way to strengthen the confidence of those blacks who harbor an internalized hatred of their dark skin.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, it is perplexing to discover that this same celebrity, who very publicly had her signature face lightened for the L’Oreal ad, previously recorded a nationally famous, chart-topping song that extolled black beauty. In May 2001, in an effort to encourage black women to embrace their fuller figures, Beyoncé, then lead singer of R&amp;B group Destiny’s Child, wrote these iconic words, “I don''t think you''re ready for this jelly. I don''t think you''re ready for this, ''cause my body''s too bootylicious for ya babe.”<a name="0.1__ftnref3"></a> Beyoncé expressed in an interview with IMDb.com that “the song was just telling everyone just forget what people are saying, you''re bootylicious. That''s all. It''s a celebration of curves and a celebration of women''s bodies.”<a name="0.1__ftnref4"></a> The rallying words of the melody embolden black women to be proud and confident about their physical appearance. Praising the black aesthetic, the song is among the first to feature a female artist proposing that a black women’s shapely physique is more attractive to males than the pin-thin frame typically associated with white celebrities. hooks would probably support Beyoncé’s effort to assert black identity and promote distinguishing black qualities as beautiful in their own right. The words of the song have the power “to make the images live” (63) and “announc[e] our visual complexity” (61) to a society that has not thus far opened their eyes to black beauty.\r\n\r\nIt seems then that Beyoncé straddles two diametrically opposed identities within the two exhibits – the “Bootylicious” song that glorifies the black aesthetic and the L’Oreal ad that stigmatizes it. Nevertheless, it is not as simple as black or white. It is possible that one could infer the opposite distinction from Beyoncé’s two exhibits. One can interpret the L’Oreal ad as actually the more positive of the two images and the song as more disparaging to black identity. The L’Oreal Ad, though widely perceived to be attacking black aesthetics could potentially be more of a glorification of black beauty than “Bootylicious.” The advertisement depicts Beyoncé as a breathtaking woman with enviable skin and magnificent hair. Even though her complexion is whiter, Beyoncé is still noticeably black in the photograph. Many women that see that photo will wish they looked just like Beyoncé, no matter that she is African American. The L’Oreal ad in no way diminishes her indisputable beauty, but instead gives the white consumer an opportunity to appreciate it. The song “Bootylicious,” however, contains lyrics that characterize black women’s bodies in a carnal and purely sexualized way. The song refers to black woman as though they are just sexual conquests for males. The lyrics describe the black aesthetic using derogatory terminology, casting the black physique in a negative light. Therefore, one can say that an ad that works to reduce the traces of blackness—namely the L’Oreal endorsement—in actuality, applauds the black aesthetic more so than a song that comments on the black female’s curves—namely “Bootylicious”— but disrespects the black figure.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that both of Beyoncé’s contradictory exhibitions help in constructing her own black identity. One can speculate that the reasoning for her paradoxical behavior is her desire to appeal to multiple publics. As a celebrity, Beyoncé feels the pressure to appeal to all people, sometimes by obliging societal expectations and sometimes by making controversial claims in lyrics that challenge those very same conventions. For the aesthetic market dominated by ideal beauty standards, Beyoncé knows a whiter image will help sell more products. For the black community, embracing her ethnicity will help captivate her audience. She is able to miraculously be both a black advocate and a white conformist. In a way, Beyoncé is a bridge between the two worlds, paving new grounds in white society’s recognition of ethnic beauty and introducing Caucasian principles to black society.

(213, 5, '2011-12-17 04:13:55', '2011-12-17 04:13:55', 'Performance artist John Kelly is that most elusive sort of creator: one that challenges his public and stays true to his principles while managing to sell. His work has garnered both critical and popular acclaim, despite his atypical and potentially disquieting performance style. His longest-running and most famous show (he has dubbed it his "Bolero") is "Paved Paradise," an homage to Joni Mitchell performed in a wig, dress, and full makeup (Levy). The act has been a hit since its debut at the inaugural Wigstock festival in 1985, so much so that Kelly has nearly become defined by it (Levy). People continuously pay good money to watch John Kelly "do Joni," and it''s not only the gay community in the audience: a survey of blogs and comments on Internet sites shows that heterosexuals embrace the idea of the drag show as well, at least when Kelly is the one doing the dragging (<em>John Kelly Performance</em>). It''s a little strange that this should be so. After all, many people might be profoundly perturbed if John Kelly entered their homes as Joni Mitchell or bumped into them on the street wearing lipstick and heels. Yet patrons gladly shell out for theater tickets to watch Kelly perform drag on a stage in front of hundreds of people. How can such behavior be so frowned upon in private yet cheered in public? To attempt to understand this conundrum, we must first determine why drag can both disturb and delight.\r\n\r\nIn feminist theorist Judith Butler''s book, <em>Gender Trouble</em>, she argues that our society has developed a "radical dependency" on a "very binary frame [of] thinking about gender" (xxx). We create "ostensible categories" through our system of gender norms, a system which is based on a perceived masculine/feminine dichotomy. Our "codes of purity and taboos" establish what "will and will not be intelligibly human, what will and will not be ''real''": in other words, what will be "normal" (Butler xxv). Through this process, Butler argues that questions of gender become subjected to a black-and-white discourse on "truth or falsity," where societal conventions choose who is assigned "legitimacy" (186, xxv).\r\n\r\nDrag, then, inhabits a gray area of the gender spectrum, straddling the line between true and false and even threatening to erase it altogether. When we watch a drag show, we encounter a curious challenge: how do we classify the performer based on our binary model of gender? Drag becomes an odd sort of "double inversion," setting before us two equally plausible yet opposite interpretations of the artist''s gender: the performer could be a man on the outside with a woman inside (a body with an Adam''s apple and testicles is channeling a female spirit), or (s)he could be a woman with a man inside (the feminine exterior in the form of the costume is covering up the masculine body that lies underneath) (Butler 186). These "contradict[ing]" "claims to truth" subvert the entire notion of "truth and falsity" (Butler 186-7). Drag queens blatantly buck the framework of binary gender that society has created (which Butler labels a "preemptive and violent circumscription of reality") and in doing so they expose "the tenuousness of gender" and the circumvention of actuality "performed by gender norms" (Butler xxv).\r\n\r\nJeffrey Jerome Cohen, an academic who often concerns himself with entities on the outskirts of our societal boundaries, writes in his essay, "Monster Culture," that beings with "ontological liminality" that hang between spheres of perception and appear to "question binary thinking and introduce a crisis" are (or can be called) "monsters" (6). Cohen''s "monsters" are entities that exist as "disturbing hybrids" outside of the "classificatory ''order of things''" (6). They are "form[s] suspended between forms," just as drag performers are. Given Butler''s analysis of drag as a force that threatens to subvert cultural boundaries, therefore, we may safely label John Kelly and his ilk "monstrous" (Cohen 6) in that they are "third term[s] that problematize the clash of extremes" (that is, terms that do not uphold our notion of a dichotomous and exclusive social order); they are "dangerous" beings that "threaten to smash distinctions" (6).\r\n\r\nThrough this discourse between Cohen and Butler, it becomes evident why drag agitates us so. The drag performer represents a direct refutation of all our preconceived binary assumptions about gender, and so can be viewed as a sort of monster. Both Cohen and Butler recognize that, in Cohen''s words, drag queens demand "a radical rethinking of boundary and normality" (6), what Butler calls "a radical shift in one''s notion of the possible and the real (xxiv). This realization that a major revision of "truth" is needed to accurately understand the complexities of gender breeds a cognitive "dissonance" in our logical, compartmentalized minds (Butler 187).\r\n\r\nPart of what makes us fear "monsters" is their ability to destroy (villages, cultural frameworks), but their "destructiveness" is really a "deconstructiveness" (Cohen 14). The monster dismantles our artificial categorizations, Cohen says, by showing us that "difference originates in process rather than in fact" (14). Butler comes to a similar conclusion regarding gender specifically, writing that the "naturalized knowledge of gender is, in fact, a changeable and revisable reality" (190, see also xxiv). Through the "double inversion" of drag (the ambiguity of the artist''s identity), "drag implicitly reveals the imitative nature of gender itself" (Butler 186-7). If the performer can essentially "play" a woman, or a man, and thereby become a strange hybrid between the two, it suggests not only that our two distinct gender categories can be mixed at will, but also that all gender identity can be arrived at through acting and imitation. A performance like John Kelly''s recognizes the artifice of the common gender structure even when such "configurations . . . are regularly assumed to be natural and necessary" (Butler 187). The "monster" of drag creates a "revolution in the very logic of meaning" (Cohen 7).\r\n\r\nThis revolutionary aspect of drag goes a long way towards explaining why Kelly refers to his performances as "punk" and also why audiences flock to see him partake in a "freakish" act (Levy). Our cognitive dissonance, our aversion to the "monster" (what Cohen would call a sort of fear), is no barrier to our enjoyment of the show—and on some level, it may even enhance it. While watching a drag show, our "bored and repressed" minds are treated to a temporary unshackling, we are "freed to populate the margins" (Cohen 17) of our conceptual landscape with John/Joni. Even if some in Kelly''s audience have no desire to don a dress themselves and start crooning "Big Yellow Taxi," on some level they appreciate and even admire Kelly''s ability to fearlessly challenge their most basic societal assumptions—as a punk rocker, he is sticking it to the man. Butler lends her support to this interpretation, arguing that "part of the pleasure [of drag] . . . is the recognition of a radical contingency between sex and gender" (Butler 187); that is, our love of the performance stems from Kelly''s demonstration that our assumed male/female dichotomy is <em>un</em>natural and<em>un</em>necessary. "We distrust . . . the monster at the same time we envy its freedom," Cohen says, and therein lies the core of our attraction to drag. It is not the cross-dressing itself that we "fear and desire," but the act of liberation that comes with the recognition of gender''s fluidity (Cohen 16). Some may still distrust the practice, or be perturbed by the implications drag holds for our societal codes, yet many are intrigued by the possibility that a performer like John Kelly offers.\r\n\r\nCohen provides one way to reconcile the inherent dilemma of the drag show (i.e., how a behavior can be held suspect in society yet lauded on stage): By keeping Kelly removed in a theatrical setting, we allow him a "clearly delimited" and "permanently liminal" space in which to live, just as we do for other "monsters" in Cohen''s conception (17). In this realm we are temporarily treated to escapist fantasies, but we can rest assured that the show will indeed sometime end. The fun of the performance only stops, Cohen says, when the monster threatens to leave its enclosure and obliterate the "thin walls of category and culture" (17). Thus Butler''s recognition that the "giddiness" of a drag show lies in "<em>implicitly reveal[ing] the imitative structure of gender itself</em>," and exposing our own cultural framework as artifice, is only half of the puzzle, because if the same device was used <em>offstage</em> to subvert gender norms the transvestite would be greeted with a profound wariness (187). The key to the appeal of drag to a mass audience is that such subversive, liberating behavior takes place as a "safe expression" of "monstrosity": it is relegated to the stage, where we may play and let our minds wander freely while knowing that we are watching a show.\r\n\r\nThis seems to adequately resolve our curious drag paradox, but our interpretation needs revision when John Kelly puts it to the test. Near the end of "Paved Paradise," the performer "suddenly sheds his costume," "stepping out of his role and creating a moment that is strangely profound" (Levy). The audience is "unsettled, affected" by this gesture, yet they often give Kelly a rousing standing ovation (Levy). Why should this moment provoke such an outpouring of approval? After all, every member of the crowd bought a ticket knowing they were going to watch a man do Joni, so why react so overtly when Kelly confirms what they already know? For that matter, what''s "unsettling" about Kelly revealing he''s not a woman—didn''t everyone come to see a dude in a dress? This moment (including Kelly''s gesture and the audience''s reaction to it) is a crucial key to understanding the drag mystery.\r\n\r\nBefore addressing the significance of this moment, though, we must acknowledge that John Kelly is extremely good at what he does.<em> The New York Times''</em> Ann Powers captures Kelly''s unique skill in her review of "Paved Paradise," writing "There''s drag, and then there''s transformation through spiritual osmosis," while no less a luminary than Joni Mitchell herself declared that watching John Kelly made her feel like "Huck Finn attending his own funeral . . . I didn''t expect to be so touched" (<em>John Kelly Performance</em>). The fact that Kelly can deliver such a profound out-of-body experience to Mitchell shows that Kelly is not simply putting a caricature before his audience, but rather fully embodying his subject so effectively that even the subject herself is moved. This holds its own implications. Butler might point out that because Kelly''s artificial gender is so convincing, it reveals that "the original identity after which gender fashions itself is an imitation" (188). But I would argue that Kelly''s skill in fact de-emphasizes the "drag" aspect of his show. Through his intense "channeling" of Mitchell, Kelly effectively makes us forget, at least for a time, that it is a man singing (Levy). He leads us into the Cohenian realm of "escapist delight" (Butler''s state of "giddiness") that results from communing with a "monster" in a secure context (17). Kelly becomes an actor, a person bringing life to a role, and if he stays in that mode, the piece is little more than a masculine woman performing. We can let our minds forget for a while that Kelly is a man because he so fully enters his character, and in doing so we take a little of the edge off "Paved Paradise."\r\n\r\nHowever, when Kelly removes his wig, we are jarred back out of this forgetfulness. The dramatic reveal is Kelly''s punkiest statement—this<em> is</em> drag, and don''t you forget it. Some may argue that by "revealing" he is a man, Kelly effectively restores order to our fragile system by upholding the "reality" of his masculinity, but I hold that the action is more complex than that. The "unsettled" crowd at this crucial moment is not disturbed because logical categories are being upheld—where''s the danger in that? They are unsettled because Kelly has taken his subversion one step further: through the "device" of shedding his costume (Kelly''s words), the performer can really "mess with people" (Levy).\r\n\r\nDrag is artifice, a kind of theater. By calling the act of removing this artifice a "device," Kelly says that even taking his wig off is a staged gesture, that the shedding of the costume and the ostensible restoration of order is just as "put on" as the drag show itself (Levy). The entirety of "Paved Paradise" is "gender performance" (that is, a man acting like a woman), but if becoming a man is part of the performance as well, then how do we know when the acting stops? How do we know when we''re watching something "real?" The answer is that it''s <em>all</em> real, and it''s equally all staged: the reveal in Kelly''s act takes us into the labyrinth of gender with no string to follow back home. Gender becomes, as Butler says, "an imitation without an origin," "neither true nor false" (188, 193).\r\n\r\nThis revelation challenges us, it pushes our buttons, yet at the same time its inherent liberation is exhilarating. The audience cheers the heady sense of freedom that comes with stretching the limits we have created for ourselves. In so effectively subverting gender constructs, Kelly takes us all the way to the edge of the cliff, lets our stomach get butterflies as we experience the thrill of looking down. Then he goes one step further by taking off the wig. He shoves us over, yet catches us before we drop, leading to such a rush that we have to cheer. "Paved Paradise" strains our boundaries to their extreme, yet stays <em>just</em> safe enough (as a stage show) to keep its audience from becoming too frightened. John Kelly''s drag is exciting because it is somewhat akin to cognitive bungee-jumping, with trust in the fiction of theater as the cord.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', '"The Giddiness of the Performance": An Investigation of Disturbing, Delightful Drag', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'the-giddiness-of-the-performance-an-investigation-of-disturbing-delightful-drag', '', '', '2012-04-10 15:26:25', '2012-04-10 15:26:25', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=213', 0, 'essay', '', 0),

Despite being the longest and most expensive FBI manhunt to date with a record-setting $1 million reward, the search for the mysterious Unabomber was brought to a close only after his younger brother, David Kaczynski, came forward with his suspicions that Ted could be the Unabomber (Graham). David had noticed striking similarities between the "Unabomber''s Manifesto," published in 1995, and letters his older brother had sent him over the years (Graham).\r\n\r\nThe public was captivated by this modern betrayal-epic, a "benevolent Cain and Abel" (Glaberson). In an interview, David described the agonizing position he and his wife were placed in, forced to choose between his brother''s life and that of his next victim: "We found ourselves in a position where anything we did could lead to somebody''s death. I can''t tell you what that felt like" (Graham). His decision was praised by many. He was hailed for "doing the only honest thing any sane person could have done" and 44-year-old West Hills resident Barbara Frank remarked, "I don''t think I could live with myself knowing a relative was responsible for causing misery and destruction to other people" (Shuster). A somewhat surprised David reported that "not only haven''t we gotten a lot of angry or abusive letters, but we''ve really gotten a lot of letters from people who thanked us for having the courage to do what we did" (Graham). To most, the prospect of another dead victim was enough to justify the brotherly betrayal.\r\n\r\nEven so, the actions of the younger Kaczynski were not universally hailed. David Letterman dubbed him "The Unasquealer" and on the Tuesday after the story broke, CNN''s "Talk Back Live" debated "whether he was saint or snitch" (Dowd). Others, like mechanic Dave Kubert, remarked that these situations are "still something to be resolved within the family" (Shuster). Explaining this kind of negative reaction to David Kacyznski''s actions, <em>New York Times</em> reporter Maureen Dowd wrote: "Many Americans subscribe to the sentiment expressed by E. M. Forster: ''If I had to choose between betraying my country and betraying my friend, I hope I should have the guts to betray my country.''" This disapproving group placed the value of family loyalty—and their disdain for snitching—above not only the million dollar reward, but also above the potential consequences of remaining silent.\r\n\r\nDavid Kaczynski quickly donated the FBI''s reward to the families of his brother''s victims (Brooke). David likely felt that keeping such a reward would be inappropriate, as his actions were motivated by concern for potential victims rather than by personal gain. Imagine the public outcry against the younger Kaczynski had he accepted the FBI''s proverbial thirty pieces of silver. Yet this purchase of betrayal is exactly the type of transaction that occurs every day within the criminal justice system. Criminal informants regularly "flip" on their associates in return for some type of reward—often consisting of heavily reduced sentences. By rewarding those criminals who provide information, the government is encouraging betrayal and sanctioning disloyalty. Regardless of the individual morality of David Kaczynski and of the more self-interested (and numerous) criminal informants, it is worth considering the implications of the justice system''s endorsement of disloyalty and how this endorsement reflects on our societal values and the perceived legitimacy of the legal system.\r\n\r\nThe negative responses to David Kacyznski''s decision to turn in his brother reflect not only the collective value we place on family loyalty, but also the extreme negative sentiment commonly felt for snitches and informants of all sorts. In the Divine Comedy, Dante reserves the 9th and lowest circle of hell for traitors and betrayers, who are damned instantly from the moment that "any soul becomes a traitor…then a demon takes its body away—and keeps that body in his power until its years have run their course completely" (207). At the center of the 9th circle, Dante describes the three-faced Satan who in each mouth "with gnashing teeth...tore to bits a sinner," specifically the infamous traitors Brutus, Cassius and worst of all Judas Iscariot (210). Thus the betrayers of Dante''s past and present (for he places many of his treacherous contemporaries in the frozen lake Cocytus, as well) are given a special place in Hell, closest to the Devil himself. This placement expresses a disdain for disloyalty that extends throughout history.\r\n\r\nColumbia law professor George Fletcher acknowledges this deep, negative sentiment in his book, <em>Loyalty: An Essay on the Morality of Relationships</em>, when he writes: "Some of the strongest moral epithets in the English language are reserved for the weak who cannot meet the threshold of loyalty: They commit adultery, betrayal and treason" (8). Fletcher notes that these epithets for "the sin of betrayal" are "worse than murder, worse than incest" and invite "universal scorn" of the traitor (41). Why such a strong response to disloyalty? Fletcher argues that "loyalty enables individuals to grasp the humanity of their fellow citizens and to treat them as bearers of equal rights" (21). Thus, the heavy condemnation of disloyalty serves as a defense mechanism to protect the trust-based, interpersonal relationships that society is built upon. Any actions taken to jeopardize that trust must be considered carefully.\r\n\r\nOne such action is "snitching" or, more specifically, acting as a criminal informant. In 1999, Fordham law professor Ian Weinstein estimated that "twenty percent of all defendants ally themselves with the prosecutor (and many more try)" (617). Snitching alone destroys trust, but this type of widespread government endorsement of the practice has amplified and institutionalized its consequences. This practice does not just undermine the trust of a single relationship; rather, entire communities are suffering the consequences. Loyola law professor and ex-Federal Public Defender Alexandra Natapoff chronicles this phenomenon in her paper, "Snitching: The Institutional and Communal Consequences." She argues that "criminally active informants exacerbate a culture in which crime is commonplace and tolerated" and, in communities where "approximately one in twelve men are active informants," it is no surprise that there is immense damage done to "the fabric of interpersonal trust and psychological security" (687-690). Not only does snitching destroy trust within a community, but its negative consequences also have a severe impact on citizens'' views of the legal system and undermine their confidence that the government is acting in their best interest. Society must believe that institutions such as the legal system legitimately reflect their goals and values; otherwise the only incentive to obey is fear of punishment.\r\n\r\nWhy is disloyalty encouraged and rewarded among criminals while elsewhere (e.g. playground tattletales or the police "blue wall of silence") it is so heavily condemned? Mostly because society fears the harm criminals pose. Due to heavy case loads and minimal supplementary evidence, collecting informant testimony is often the only way that law enforcement officials can prosecute offenders (Richman 1). As harmful as snitching is to a community, it would be equally unacceptable to let unknown numbers of offenders go unpunished, which, unhelpfully, would also result in a decreased perception of the legal system''s legitimacy.\r\n\r\nThe practice of using criminal informants clearly reflects the hierarchy of moral values in our society. In his paper, "When Morality Opposes Justice," American psychologist Jonathan Haidt describes his theory that there are "five psychological systems that provide the foundations for the world''s many moralities" (1). Haidt believes that these five foundations are based on concerns for harm/care, fairness/reciprocity, in-group/loyalty, authority/respect, and purity/sanctity, and that different cultures and groups develop these virtues (2). If we take the legal system''s practice of using criminal informants as an extension of our society''s values (admittedly, a substantial assumption), we can uncover a moral hierarchy. Concerns for harm at the hands of criminals exceed the importance placed on loyalty to a community. The sphere of fairness presents a more complicated issue. On the one hand, informing is justified as it brings criminals to justice and makes them pay for their actions. On the other hand, "any system that rewards cooperation…can favor the most culpable defendants," a phenomenon known as "inverted sentencing" (Richman 1), which throws the fairness of the practice into question. Judging from these observations about our legal system, it seems that of Haidt''s foundations, society''s concern for preventing harm takes precedence over the moral spheres of loyalty and fairness.\r\n\r\nWhy is this so? And do these conclusions reflect society''s true values, especially considering that a universal disdain for informants implies that loyalty is of no minor significance? In his paper, "Coercive Sentencing," Michigan law professor Steven Nemerson summarizes the utilitarian influences on our justice system and their use as justification for rewarding cooperating defendants. Nemerson argues that, in its simplest terms, "utilitarianism holds that an act is morally acceptable if it maximizes overall social well-being, measured in terms of people''s happiness" and that "the supplying of information and testimony by defendants and their use as active informants serves to detect and prevent crime," which increases social well-being (684). With this utilitarian calculus in mind it is easy to see how crime''s explicit immorality and its obvious negative effects on social happiness justify the overriding importance the legal system places on the moral principle of preventing harm, at the expense of personal loyalties.\r\n\r\nHowever, as the controversy in Unabomber case demonstrates, not all Americans agree with this ordering, and for them, the legal system fails to reflect their moral values, an extremely dangerous prospect to any society. Also, as Professor Natapoff demonstrates, there are less apparent damages that result from the practice of widespread informant use and the normative message that this practice sends by rewarding disloyalty. Not only does it run the risk of undermining Haidt''s core values of fairness and loyalty, but the communities that suffer from the practice also lose their respect for authority and law enforcement, and thus another of Haidt''s principles (authority/respect) is compromised. The practice of rewarding informants with reduced sentences may be a necessity to the prosecution of many criminals, but the dangers of undermining three out of Haidt''s five foundations for all social values cannot be ignored.\r\n\r\nThe practice of using criminal informants thus presents something of a moral paradox. Experimental psychologist and author Stephen Pinker observes that most people believe that "not only is it allowable to inflict pain on a person who has broken a moral rule; it is wrong <em>not</em> to, to ''let them get away with it''" (2). Our justice system is designed to punish those guilty of breaking the law (society''s moral rules) and, in doing so, it employs a number of different tactics, including the rewarding of informants. However, in its efforts to "inflict pain" on criminal offenders, the justice system allows cooperators to "get away with it." This type of self-defeating paradox is exactly what makes the use of informants such a dangerous practice. In attempting to defend communities from harm, the legal system undermines the interpersonal trust that those groups are based on. From a utilitarian view, it is not even clear if the crime prevented through informant testimony outweighs the informant''s own criminal activity that goes overlooked, or the aforementioned community harm. By striking deals with those criminals who are often the most culpable, the legitimacy of the justice system—which may not even reflect its constituents'' own moral values—is called into question.\r\n\r\nThe legal system is in many ways sensitive to the same forces as the economy; its power is ultimately based on citizens'' confidence that the system works. That confidence weakens when snitching undermines the essential trust that, as Fletcher said, "enables individuals to grasp the humanity of their fellow citizens" (21). If the use of informants is indeed a necessary evil, it is one that must be handled carefully so that faith in the system does not dwindle.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-admin/media.php?attachment_id=196&amp;action=edit">Legitimacy of the System: Implications of Government-Endorsed Disloyalty<span style="text-decoration: underline;">_PDF</span></a>', 'Legitimacy of the System: Implications of Government-Endorsed Disloyalty', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'legitimacy-of-the-system-implications-of-government-endorsed-disloyalty', '', '', '2012-03-23 15:24:43', '2012-03-23 15:24:43', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=214', 0, 'essay', '', 0),

Any actions taken to jeopardize that trust must be considered carefully.\n\nOne such action is "snitching" or, more specifically, acting as a criminal informant. In 1999, Fordham law professor Ian Weinstein estimated that "twenty percent of all defendants ally themselves with the prosecutor (and many more try)" (617). Snitching alone destroys trust, but this type of widespread government endorsement of the practice has amplified and institutionalized its consequences. This practice does not just undermine the trust of a single relationship; rather, entire communities are suffering the consequences. Loyola law professor and ex-Federal Public Defender Alexandra Natapoff chronicles this phenomenon in her paper, "Snitching: The Institutional and Communal Consequences." She argues that "criminally active informants exacerbate a culture in which crime is commonplace and tolerated" and, in communities where "approximately one in twelve men are active informants," it is no surprise that there is immense damage done to "the fabric of interpersonal trust and psychological security" (687-690). Not only does snitching destroy trust within a community, but its negative consequences also have a severe impact on citizens'' views of the legal system and undermine their confidence that the government is acting in their best interest. Society must believe that institutions such as the legal system legitimately reflect their goals and values; otherwise the only incentive to obey is fear of punishment.\n\nWhy is disloyalty encouraged and rewarded among criminals while elsewhere (e.g. playground tattletales or the police "blue wall of silence") it is so heavily condemned? Mostly because society fears the harm criminals pose. Due to heavy case loads and minimal supplementary evidence, collecting informant testimony is often the only way that law enforcement officials can prosecute offenders (Richman 1). As harmful as snitching is to a community, it would be equally unacceptable to let unknown numbers of offenders go unpunished, which, unhelpfully, would also result in a decreased perception of the legal system''s legitimacy.\n\nThe practice of using criminal informants clearly reflects the hierarchy of moral values in our society. In his paper, "When Morality Opposes Justice," American psychologist Jonathan Haidt describes his theory that there are "five psychological systems that provide the foundations for the world''s many moralities" (1). Haidt believes that these five foundations are based on concerns for harm/care, fairness/reciprocity, in-group/loyalty, authority/respect, and purity/sanctity, and that different cultures and groups develop these virtues (2). If we take the legal system''s practice of using criminal informants as an extension of our society''s values (admittedly, a substantial assumption), we can uncover a moral hierarchy. Concerns for harm at the hands of criminals exceed the importance placed on loyalty to a community. The sphere of fairness presents a more complicated issue. On the one hand, informing is justified as it brings criminals to justice and makes them pay for their actions. On the other hand, "any system that rewards cooperation…can favor the most culpable defendants," a phenomenon known as "inverted sentencing" (Richman 1), which throws the fairness of the practice into question. Judging from these observations about our legal system, it seems that of Haidt''s foundations, society''s concern for preventing harm takes precedence over the moral spheres of loyalty and fairness.\n\nWhy is this so? And do these conclusions reflect society''s true values, especially considering that a universal disdain for informants implies that loyalty is of no minor significance? In his paper, "Coercive Sentencing," Michigan law professor Steven Nemerson summarizes the utilitarian influences on our justice system and their use as justification for rewarding cooperating defendants. Nemerson argues that, in its simplest terms, "utilitarianism holds that an act is morally acceptable if it maximizes overall social well-being, measured in terms of people''s happiness" and that "the supplying of information and testimony by defendants and their use as active informants serves to detect and prevent crime," which increases social well-being (684). With this utilitarian calculus in mind it is easy to see how crime''s explicit immorality and its obvious negative effects on social happiness justify the overriding importance the legal system places on the moral principle of preventing harm, at the expense of personal loyalties.\n\nHowever, as the controversy in Unabomber case demonstrates, not all Americans agree with this ordering, and for them, the legal system fails to reflect their moral values, an extremely dangerous prospect to any society. Also, as Professor Natapoff demonstrates, there are less apparent damages that result from the practice of widespread informant use and the normative message that this practice sends by rewarding disloyalty. Not only does it run the risk of undermining Haidt''s core values of fairness and loyalty, but the communities that suffer from the practice also lose their respect for authority and law enforcement, and thus another of Haidt''s principles (authority/respect) is compromised. The practice of rewarding informants with reduced sentences may be a necessity to the prosecution of many criminals, but the dangers of undermining three out of Haidt''s five foundations for all social values cannot be ignored.\n\nThe practice of using criminal informants thus presents something of a moral paradox. Experimental psychologist and author Stephen Pinker observes that most people believe that "not only is it allowable to inflict pain on a person who has broken a moral rule; it is wrong <em>not</em> to, to ''let them get away with it''" (2). Our justice system is designed to punish those guilty of breaking the law (society''s moral rules) and, in doing so, it employs a number of different tactics, including the rewarding of informants. However, in its efforts to "inflict pain" on criminal offenders, the justice system allows cooperators to "get away with it." This type of self-defeating paradox is exactly what makes the use of informants such a dangerous practice. In attempting to defend communities from harm, the legal system undermines the interpersonal trust that those groups are based on. From a utilitarian view, it is not even clear if the crime prevented through informant testimony outweighs the informant''s own criminal activity that goes overlooked, or the aforementioned community harm. By striking deals with those criminals who are often the most culpable, the legitimacy of the justice system—which may not even reflect its constituents'' own moral values—is called into question.\n\nThe legal system is in many ways sensitive to the same forces as the economy; its power is ultimately based on citizens'' confidence that the system works. That confidence weakens when snitching undermines the essential trust that, as Fletcher said, "enables individuals to grasp the humanity of their fellow citizens" (21). If the use of informants is indeed a necessary evil, it is one that must be handled carefully so that faith in the system does not dwindle.\n\n<a href="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-admin/media.php?attachment_id=196&amp;action=edit">Legitimacy of the System: Implications of Government-Endorsed Disloyalty<span style="text-decoration: underline;">_PDF</span></a>', 'Legitimacy of the System: Implications of Government-Endorsed Disloyalty', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '214-autosave', '', '', '2012-03-23 15:24:21', '2012-03-23 15:24:21', '', 214, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?p=215', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

(216, 3, '2012-04-09 18:35:52', '2012-04-09 18:35:52', 'Performance artist John Kelly is that most elusive sort of creator: one that challenges his public and stays true to his principles while managing to sell. His work has garnered both critical and popular acclaim, despite his atypical and potentially disquieting performance style. His longest-running and most famous show (he has dubbed it his "Bolero") is "Paved Paradise," an homage to Joni Mitchell performed in a wig, dress, and full makeup (Levy). The act has been a hit since its debut at the inaugural Wigstock festival in 1985, so much so that Kelly has nearly become defined by it (Levy). People continuously pay good money to watch John Kelly "do Joni," and it''s not only the gay community in the audience: a survey of blogs and comments on Internet sites shows that heterosexuals embrace the idea of the drag show as well, at least when Kelly is the one doing the dragging (<em>John Kelly Performance</em>). It''s a little strange that this should be so. After all, many people might be profoundly perturbed if John Kelly entered their homes as Joni Mitchell or bumped into them on the street wearing lipstick and heels. Yet patrons gladly shell out for theater tickets to watch Kelly perform drag on a stage in front of hundreds of people. How can such behavior be so frowned upon in private yet cheered in public? To attempt to understand this conundrum, we must first determine why drag can both disturb and delight.\n\nIn feminist theorist Judith Butler''s book, <em>Gender Trouble</em>, she argues that our society has developed a "radical dependency" on a "very binary frame [of] thinking about gender" (xxx). We create "ostensible categories" through our system of gender norms, a system which is based on a perceived masculine/feminine dichotomy. Our "codes of purity and taboos" establish what "will and will not be intelligibly human, what will and will not be ''real''": in other words, what will be "normal" (Butler xxv). Through this process, Butler argues that questions of gender become subjected to a black-and-white discourse on "truth or falsity," where societal conventions choose who is assigned "legitimacy" (186, xxv).\n\nDrag, then, inhabits a gray area of the gender spectrum, straddling the line between true and false and even threatening to erase it altogether. When we watch a drag show, we encounter a curious challenge: how do we classify the performer based on our binary model of gender? Drag becomes an odd sort of "double inversion," setting before us two equally plausible yet opposite interpretations of the artist''s gender: the performer could be a man on the outside with a woman inside (a body with an Adam''s apple and testicles is channeling a female spirit), or (s)he could be a woman with a man inside (the feminine exterior in the form of the costume is covering up the masculine body that lies underneath) (Butler 186). These "contradict[ing]" "claims to truth" subvert the entire notion of "truth and falsity" (Butler 186-7). Drag queens blatantly buck the framework of binary gender that society has created (which Butler labels a "preemptive and violent circumscription of reality") and in doing so they expose "the tenuousness of gender" and the circumvention of actuality "performed by gender norms" (Butler xxv).\n\nJeffrey Jerome Cohen, an academic who often concerns himself with entities on the outskirts of our societal boundaries, writes in his essay, "Monster Culture," that beings with "ontological liminality" that hang between spheres of perception and appear to "question binary thinking and introduce a crisis" are (or can be called) "monsters" (6). Cohen''s "monsters" are entities that exist as "disturbing hybrids" outside of the "classificatory ''order of things''" (6). They are "form[s] suspended between forms," just as drag performers are. Given Butler''s analysis of drag as a force that threatens to subvert cultural boundaries, therefore, we may safely label John Kelly and his ilk "monstrous" (Cohen 6) in that they are "third term[s] that problematize the clash of extremes" (that is, terms that do not uphold our notion of a dichotomous and exclusive social order); they are "dangerous" beings that "threaten to smash distinctions" (6).\n\nThrough this discourse between Cohen and Butler, it becomes evident why drag agitates us so. The drag performer represents a direct refutation of all our preconceived binary assumptions about gender, and so can be viewed as a sort of monster. Both Cohen and Butler recognize that, in Cohen''s words, drag queens demand "a radical rethinking of boundary and normality" (6), what Butler calls "a radical shift in one''s notion of the possible and the real (xxiv). This realization that a major revision of "truth" is needed to accurately understand the complexities of gender breeds a cognitive "dissonance" in our logical, compartmentalized minds (Butler 187).\n\nPart of what makes us fear "monsters" is their ability to destroy (villages, cultural frameworks), but their "destructiveness" is really a "deconstructiveness" (Cohen 14). The monster dismantles our artificial categorizations, Cohen says, by showing us that "difference originates in process rather than in fact" (14). Butler comes to a similar conclusion regarding gender specifically, writing that the "naturalized knowledge of gender is, in fact, a changeable and revisable reality" (190, see also xxiv). Through the "double inversion" of drag (the ambiguity of the artist''s identity), "drag implicitly reveals the imitative nature of gender itself" (Butler 186-7). If the performer can essentially "play" a woman, or a man, and thereby become a strange hybrid between the two, it suggests not only that our two distinct gender categories can be mixed at will, but also that all gender identity can be arrived at through acting and imitation. A performance like John Kelly''s recognizes the artifice of the common gender structure even when such "configurations . . . are regularly assumed to be natural and necessary" (Butler 187). The "monster" of drag creates a "revolution in the very logic of meaning" (Cohen 7).\n\nThis revolutionary aspect of drag goes a long way towards explaining why Kelly refers to his performances as "punk" and also why audiences flock to see him partake in a "freakish" act (Levy). Our cognitive dissonance, our aversion to the "monster" (what Cohen would call a sort of fear), is no barrier to our enjoyment of the show—and on some level, it may even enhance it. While watching a drag show, our "bored and repressed" minds are treated to a temporary unshackling, we are "freed to populate the margins" (Cohen 17) of our conceptual landscape with John/Joni. Even if some in Kelly''s audience have no desire to don a dress themselves and start crooning "Big Yellow Taxi," on some level they appreciate and even admire Kelly''s ability to fearlessly challenge their most basic societal assumptions—as a punk rocker, he is sticking it to the man. Butler lends her support to this interpretation, arguing that "part of the pleasure [of drag] . . . is the recognition of a radical contingency between sex and gender" (Butler 187); that is, our love of the performance stems from Kelly''s demonstration that our assumed male/female dichotomy is <em>un</em>natural and<em>un</em>necessary. "We distrust . . . the monster at the same time we envy its freedom," Cohen says, and therein lies the core of our attraction to drag. It is not the cross-dressing itself that we "fear and desire," but the act of liberation that comes with the recognition of gender''s fluidity (Cohen 16). Some may still distrust the practice, or be perturbed by the implications drag holds for our societal codes, yet many are intrigued by the possibility that a performer like John Kelly offers.\n\nCohen provides one way to reconcile the inherent dilemma of the drag show (i.e., how a behavior can be held suspect in society yet lauded on stage): By keeping Kelly removed in a theatrical setting, we allow him a "clearly delimited" and "permanently liminal" space in which to live, just as we do for other "monsters" in Cohen''s conception (17). In this realm we are temporarily treated to escapist fantasies, but we can rest assured that the show will indeed sometime end. The fun of the performance only stops, Cohen says, when the monster threatens to leave its enclosure and obliterate the "thin walls of category and culture" (17). Thus Butler''s recognition that the "giddiness" of a drag show lies in "<em>implicitly reveal[ing] the imitative structure of gender itself</em>," and exposing our own cultural framework as artifice, is only half of the puzzle, because if the same device was used <em>offstage</em> to subvert gender norms the transvestite would be greeted with a profound wariness (187). The key to the appeal of drag to a mass audience is that such subversive, liberating behavior takes place as a "safe expression" of "monstrosity": it is relegated to the stage, where we may play and let our minds wander freely while knowing that we are watching a show.\n\nThis seems to adequately resolve our curious drag paradox, but our interpretation needs revision when John Kelly puts it to the test. Near the end of "Paved Paradise," the performer "suddenly sheds his costume," "stepping out of his role and creating a moment that is strangely profound" (Levy). The audience is "unsettled, affected" by this gesture, yet they often give Kelly a rousing standing ovation (Levy). Why should this moment provoke such an outpouring of approval? After all, every member of the crowd bought a ticket knowing they were going to watch a man do Joni, so why react so overtly when Kelly confirms what they already know? For that matter, what''s "unsettling" about Kelly revealing he''s not a woman—didn''t everyone come to see a dude in a dress? This moment (including Kelly''s gesture and the audience''s reaction to it) is a crucial key to understanding the drag mystery.\n\nBefore addressing the significance of this moment, though, we must acknowledge that John Kelly is extremely good at what he does.<em> The New York Times''</em> Ann Powers captures Kelly''s unique skill in her review of "Paved Paradise," writing "There''s drag, and then there''s transformation through spiritual osmosis," while no less a luminary than Joni Mitchell herself declared that watching John Kelly made her feel like "Huck Finn attending his own funeral . . . I didn''t expect to be so touched" (<em>John Kelly Performance</em>). The fact that Kelly can deliver such a profound out-of-body experience to Mitchell shows that Kelly is not simply putting a caricature before his audience, but rather fully embodying his subject so effectively that even the subject herself is moved. This holds its own implications. Butler might point out that because Kelly''s artificial gender is so convincing, it reveals that "the original identity after which gender fashions itself is an imitation" (188). But I would argue that Kelly''s skill in fact de-emphasizes the "drag" aspect of his show. Through his intense "channeling" of Mitchell, Kelly effectively makes us forget, at least for a time, that it is a man singing (Levy). He leads us into the Cohenian realm of "escapist delight" (Butler''s state of "giddiness") that results from communing with a "monster" in a secure context (17). Kelly becomes an actor, a person bringing life to a role, and if he stays in that mode, the piece is little more than a masculine woman performing. We can let our minds forget for a while that Kelly is a man because he so fully enters his character, and in doing so we take a little of the edge off "Paved Paradise."\n\nHowever, when Kelly removes his wig, we are jarred back out of this forgetfulness. The dramatic reveal is Kelly''s punkiest statement—this<em> is</em> drag, and don''t you forget it. Some may argue that by "revealing" he is a man, Kelly effectively restores order to our fragile system by upholding the "reality" of his masculinity, but I hold that the action is more complex than that. The "unsettled" crowd at this crucial moment is not disturbed because logical categories are being upheld—where''s the danger in that? They are unsettled because Kelly has taken his subversion one step further: through the "device" of shedding his costume (Kelly''s words), the performer can really "mess with people" (Levy).\n\nDrag is artifice, a kind of theater. By calling the act of removing this artifice a "device," Kelly says that even taking his wig off is a staged gesture, that the shedding of the costume and the ostensible restoration of order is just as "put on" as the drag show itself (Levy). The entirety of "Paved Paradise" is "gender performance" (that is, a man acting like a woman), but if becoming a man is part of the performance as well, then how do we know when the acting stops? How do we know when we''re watching something "real?" The answer is that it''s <em>all</em> real, and it''s equally all staged: the reveal in Kelly''s act takes us into the labyrinth of gender with no string to follow back home. Gender becomes, as Butler says, "an imitation without an origin," "neither true nor false" (188, 193).\n\nThis revelation challenges us, it pushes our buttons, yet at the same time its inherent liberation is exhilarating. The audience cheers the heady sense of freedom that comes with stretching the limits we have created for ourselves. In so effectively subverting gender constructs, Kelly takes us all the way to the edge of the cliff, lets our stomach get butterflies as we experience the thrill of looking down. Then he goes one step further by taking off the wig. He shoves us over, yet catches us before we drop, leading to such a rush that we have to cheer. "Paved Paradise" strains our boundaries to their extreme, yet stays <em>just</em> safe enough (as a stage show) to keep its audience from becoming too frightened. John Kelly''s drag is exciting because it is somewhat akin to cognitive bungee-jumping, with trust in the fiction of theater as the cord.\n\n&nbsp;', '"The Giddiness of the Performance": An Investigation of Disturbing, Delightful Drag', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '213-autosave', '', '', '2012-04-09 18:35:52', '2012-04-09 18:35:52', '', 213, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?p=216', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

She is featured in deep shadow at the rear of what looks to be a small corporate jet. She sits alone on the leather seat, cross-legged, and stares off into the distance past the camera, seemingly with no knowledge of its presence. I am compelled by the moment’s quiet intimacy; the photograph offers the illusion of reality, as opposed to a shot for which Fiorina struck a pose. A slight blue tint glazes the photo but there is no movement, no other living being. The focus is Fiorina and her stoic presence; deep in thought, she is neither smiling nor frowning. The image is from a series of over 200 portraits of American women published together in 1999 by photographer Annie Leibovitz. As I thumb through the large book, I am puzzled and intrigued by Leibovitz’s project: what, if anything, is she up to? Is this yet another coffee-table book of glossy photographs loosely strung together by a sweeping thesis or a retrospective with greater ambitions? What is so compelling about Fiorina’s representation?\r\n\r\nIn her essay entitled “In Our Glory: Photography and Black Life,” bell hooks explores photography and image-making as powerful means of representation. She explicitly defines “representation” as “control over images” (57). The central, primary document she uses to explore this idea is a snapshot of her father, entitled “In his glory” (53). She is surprised by the bold openness with which “he faces the camera”: this was an image of a black man in his own context. It seems to me that hooks’ definition of representation acknowledges an entire spectrum of control: first, an image’s subject and content, but also the framing of that image, control over the access of an image, the nature of its presentation and context, and so on. Hooks argues that insofar as we are able to control how others see us, photography is always subjective. This feature of constructing personal identity is linked to hooks’ conclusion that photography also reflects the community. As a black woman, she characterizes the array of photographs hung on her grandmother’s walls as empowering and a reflection of her community’s visual complexity. Significantly, these photographs, which reflected her community, were made by members of her community. Photography’s subjectivity can be understood from the perspective of the viewer of the image, but also its maker. Through hooks’ observations about representation, Leibovitz emerges as a figure with intent, with awareness of the representation of her subject. She exercises control over her images, which take on new significance.\r\n\r\nLeibovitz has said that completing the book did not change her idea of what it meant to be a woman. But from the outside looking in, she said it was the first time that women “have [had] ambition, that they mind.” Hooks speaks to this tension as the ongoing struggle between “how we see ourselves” and “how others see us” (57); for Leibovitz perhaps the distinction is between “how women see themselves” and “how society sees them.” Each case involves a subjugated community whose understanding of itself is at odds with that of an “other.” But hooks’ focus is racial oppression. She calls for an intervention in which black image production serves as a significant means of self-representation. The personal photographs on her grandmother’s wall are, for her, an important departure from white control over black images; these were images of a segregated community produced from within that community. Still, despite hooks’ claim that racist images were being countered by true-to-life images, self-representation has little to do with presenting a truer sense of reality (59). The power of self-representation is such that people can always control how others view them—no representation is any more “real” than another. In this way, the essay sheds light on Leibovitz’s work: as a woman photographing women, she uses self-representation as a means of challenging traditional depictions of women made by men, or the “others” outside her community.\r\n\r\nMidway through her investigation, hooks introduces Roger Wilkins’ theory that the power over representation allows one to “define reality ... manage perceptions and ... arrange politics and culture to reinforce those definitions” (58). This is also an appropriate definition for “authorship,” despite the fact that hooks does not use the word explicitly. Through this idea of photographer as author, hooks explores the camera as “a political instrument” (60). She asserts that much of the black liberation movement can be seen as a “struggle over images” in which society’s most prevalent representations of blacks were controlled by persons outside the black community (57). It is an argument which (when taken with Leibovitz''s portraits) also makes sense in the context of the women’s rights movement. When hooks’ theory is applied to Leibovitz’s photography, her images become a means of challenging and resisting the misrepresentation of women. While Leibovitz’s intent may be clearer through hooks’ essay, we must return to the photographs themselves in order to examine if and how she manages to achieve her objective.\r\nAs a spectator viewing the image of Carly Fiorina, I am struck by a paradox: is this a private moment of content, self-assuredness, or a solemn portrait of a person struck by the solitude of power? The tone here is neither blatantly celebratory nor somber. Visually, Fiorina is isolated and her body language could be interpreted as further signs of that solitariness: her legs are crossed, she is turned into herself, her hands rest just above her knees. The framing of the scene around the plane’s rear compartment captures a world physically closing in around her. On the other hand, that very arch of the plane, which closes her off from the outside world, also acts as a lens, which draws the viewer''s attention inward. Are we meant to be drawn towards Fiorina’s confidence and dignified comfort in this world? hooks might interpret this ambiguity as a kind of visual resistance that substitutes female archetypes with representations of individuality. Leibovitz’s representation intentionally poses questions that cannot be answered in any narrow sense. For hooks, the “dehumanization” of blacks as caricatures or cartoon-like figures on saltshakers and cookie jars could only be challenged through the presence of humanity in the photos from her childhood (59). Self-representation offered a “sense of self and identity” (63). The paradox, which I confronted in the image of Carly Fiorina, is a feature of her representation. Leibovitz challenges the archetype of “a woman in power” by framing the photo in such a way as to prevent Fiorina’s state from being singularly definable. She is more than “a woman,” more than “a powerful woman;” here, Fiorina does not fit into a mold because she is instead represented as a living, breathing individual. She has identity separate from her distinction as a woman, a sense of self.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_48" align="alignright" width="378" caption="Bene_E1_clip_image004"]<img class="size-full wp-image-48 " title="Bene_E1_clip_image004" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Bene_E1_clip_image004.jpg" alt="Bene_E1_clip_image004" width="378" height="243" />[/caption]\r\n\r\nLeibovitz’s project presents itself as a unique opportunity to challenge through representation. In denying the spectator''s ability to define in exclusive terms, Leibovitz is acutely aware of the power of representation, or the control over images. A photograph of Supreme Court Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sandra Day O’Connor appears in the latter half of the book. Their faces are familiar but their status is elevated, regal in their judicial robes. For me, this photograph involves a unique acknowledgment of traditional, archetypal representations of women: that they are presented to be looked at. They are the objects of our gaze. Here, Ginsburg and O’Connor look out at us. Leibovitz’s mise-en-scène evokes a particular openness. Contrary to the portrait of Carly Fiorina, this environment is well lit, even bright. The room is not claustrophobic but spacious and elongated, actually extending beyond the frame. The table itself has an open, reflective quality. The two women turn out to face us but their unflinching strength suggests they expect something in return. And if we have nothing to say to them, they certainly seem prepared to speak to us. They will not merely accept our passive gaze. They do, however, seem to accept the gaze of the man featured in the portrait above them. The portrait’s gold-frame is the most striking hue in the photograph. Is this looming presence related to the struggle over sexism which itself still overhangs America’s political-judicial system? Or is their disregard for the portrait’s presence more significant? Are they content or burdened or both?\r\n\r\nJust as hooks describes her father as one who “exerted control over [her family’s] images,” Leibovitz’s authorship is significant. In the first photograph she actively crafted a presentation of Carly Fiorina that challenges sexist archetypes. She composes a purposefully ambiguous tableau, promoting conflicting observations that emphasized Fiorina’s individuality. In this second image, Leibovitz’s purpose-driven composition has less to do with paradox; instead the viewer is struck by the glaring, unmistakable presence of the man in the portrait, as he stares down over the two justices. It is difficult to ignore the collision between his presence and the women below; at the very least, Leibovitz compels us to acknowledge the gender distinction. As photographer and author, Leibovitz actively selected the setting, the costumes, the lighting, and the pose. hooks remarks that the black community’s access to image-making was liberating, in part, because “subjects [could be] positioned according to individual desire” (59). Her observations suggest that the composition of this image and the specific choices related to that composition are not coincidental but reflect Leibovitz’s specific intent. She positions these two particular women below that particular portrait deliberately in order to elicit a response. Applying hooks’ ideas, it can said that Leibovitz “resist[s] misrepresentation” by producing “alternative images” (60). The man in the portrait takes on a role quite different from his traditional cultural representation. Here, through Leibovitz’s lens, he represents men, as an entire community, and the ever-present sexist subordination of women (even those who hold the country’s highest positions of power). And yet, Ginsburg and O’Connor seem undeterred by this man’s presence; they are not victims of his glance but neither are they detached from it.\r\n\r\nhooks accounts for the coexistence of these opposing possibilities (the kind that also arise in the image of Fiorina) as she comments on images from her childhood: “In opposition to colonizing socialization, internalized racism, these walls [of photographs] announced our visual complexity” (61). Again, Leibovitz embraces and calls visual attention to the complexity of the individual; her representation defies narrow definition.

She is featured in deep shadow at the rear of what looks to be a small corporate jet. She sits alone on the leather seat, cross-legged, and stares off into the distance past the camera, seemingly with no knowledge of its presence. I am compelled by the moment’s quiet intimacy; the photograph offers the illusion of reality, as opposed to a shot for which Fiorina struck a pose. A slight blue tint glazes the photo but there is no movement, no other living being. The focus is Fiorina and her stoic presence; deep in thought, she is neither smiling nor frowning. The image is from a series of over 200 portraits of American women published together in 1999 by photographer Annie Leibovitz. As I thumb through the large book, I am puzzled and intrigued by Leibovitz’s project: what, if anything, is she up to? Is this yet another coffee-table book of glossy photographs loosely strung together by a sweeping thesis or a retrospective with greater ambitions? What is so compelling about Fiorina’s representation?\n\nIn her essay entitled “In Our Glory: Photography and Black Life,” bell hooks explores photography and image-making as powerful means of representation. She explicitly defines “representation” as “control over images” (57). The central, primary document she uses to explore this idea is a snapshot of her father, entitled “In his glory” (53). She is surprised by the bold openness with which “he faces the camera”: this was an image of a black man in his own context. It seems to me that hooks’ definition of representation acknowledges an entire spectrum of control: first, an image’s subject and content, but also the framing of that image, control over the access of an image, the nature of its presentation and context, and so on. Hooks argues that insofar as we are able to control how others see us, photography is always subjective. This feature of constructing personal identity is linked to hooks’ conclusion that photography also reflects the community. As a black woman, she characterizes the array of photographs hung on her grandmother’s walls as empowering and a reflection of her community’s visual complexity. Significantly, these photographs, which reflected her community, were made by members of her community. Photography’s subjectivity can be understood from the perspective of the viewer of the image, but also its maker. Through hooks’ observations about representation, Leibovitz emerges as a figure with intent, with awareness of the representation of her subject. She exercises control over her images, which take on new significance.\n\nLeibovitz has said that completing the book did not change her idea of what it meant to be a woman. But from the outside looking in, she said it was the first time that women “have [had] ambition, that they mind.” Hooks speaks to this tension as the ongoing struggle between “how we see ourselves” and “how others see us” (57); for Leibovitz perhaps the distinction is between “how women see themselves” and “how society sees them.” Each case involves a subjugated community whose understanding of itself is at odds with that of an “other.” But hooks’ focus is racial oppression. She calls for an intervention in which black image production serves as a significant means of self-representation. The personal photographs on her grandmother’s wall are, for her, an important departure from white control over black images; these were images of a segregated community produced from within that community. Still, despite hooks’ claim that racist images were being countered by true-to-life images, self-representation has little to do with presenting a truer sense of reality (59). The power of self-representation is such that people can always control how others view them—no representation is any more “real” than another. In this way, the essay sheds light on Leibovitz’s work: as a woman photographing women, she uses self-representation as a means of challenging traditional depictions of women made by men, or the “others” outside her community.\n\nMidway through her investigation, hooks introduces Roger Wilkins’ theory that the power over representation allows one to “define reality ... manage perceptions and ... arrange politics and culture to reinforce those definitions” (58). This is also an appropriate definition for “authorship,” despite the fact that hooks does not use the word explicitly. Through this idea of photographer as author, hooks explores the camera as “a political instrument” (60). She asserts that much of the black liberation movement can be seen as a “struggle over images” in which society’s most prevalent representations of blacks were controlled by persons outside the black community (57). It is an argument which (when taken with Leibovitz''s portraits) also makes sense in the context of the women’s rights movement. When hooks’ theory is applied to Leibovitz’s photography, her images become a means of challenging and resisting the misrepresentation of women. While Leibovitz’s intent may be clearer through hooks’ essay, we must return to the photographs themselves in order to examine if and how she manages to achieve her objective.\nAs a spectator viewing the image of Carly Fiorina, I am struck by a paradox: is this a private moment of content, self-assuredness, or a solemn portrait of a person struck by the solitude of power? The tone here is neither blatantly celebratory nor somber. Visually, Fiorina is isolated and her body language could be interpreted as further signs of that solitariness: her legs are crossed, she is turned into herself, her hands rest just above her knees. The framing of the scene around the plane’s rear compartment captures a world physically closing in around her. On the other hand, that very arch of the plane, which closes her off from the outside world, also acts as a lens, which draws the viewer''s attention inward. Are we meant to be drawn towards Fiorina’s confidence and dignified comfort in this world? hooks might interpret this ambiguity as a kind of visual resistance that substitutes female archetypes with representations of individuality. Leibovitz’s representation intentionally poses questions that cannot be answered in any narrow sense. For hooks, the “dehumanization” of blacks as caricatures or cartoon-like figures on saltshakers and cookie jars could only be challenged through the presence of humanity in the photos from her childhood (59). Self-representation offered a “sense of self and identity” (63). The paradox, which I confronted in the image of Carly Fiorina, is a feature of her representation. Leibovitz challenges the archetype of “a woman in power” by framing the photo in such a way as to prevent Fiorina’s state from being singularly definable. She is more than “a woman,” more than “a powerful woman;” here, Fiorina does not fit into a mold because she is instead represented as a living, breathing individual. She has identity separate from her distinction as a woman, a sense of self.\n\n<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-48" title="Bene_E1_clip_image004" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Bene_E1_clip_image004.jpg" alt="" width="378" height="243" />\n\nLeibovitz’s project presents itself as a unique opportunity to challenge through representation. In denying the spectator''s ability to define in exclusive terms, Leibovitz is acutely aware of the power of representation, or the control over images. A photograph of Supreme Court Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sandra Day O’Connor appears in the latter half of the book. Their faces are familiar but their status is elevated, regal in their judicial robes. For me, this photograph involves a unique acknowledgment of traditional, archetypal representations of women: that they are presented to be looked at. They are the objects of our gaze. Here, Ginsburg and O’Connor look out at us. Leibovitz’s mise-en-scène evokes a particular openness. Contrary to the portrait of Carly Fiorina, this environment is well lit, even bright. The room is not claustrophobic but spacious and elongated, actually extending beyond the frame. The table itself has an open, reflective quality. The two women turn out to face us but their unflinching strength suggests they expect something in return. And if we have nothing to say to them, they certainly seem prepared to speak to us. They will not merely accept our passive gaze. They do, however, seem to accept the gaze of the man featured in the portrait above them. The portrait’s gold-frame is the most striking hue in the photograph. Is this looming presence related to the struggle over sexism which itself still overhangs America’s political-judicial system? Or is their disregard for the portrait’s presence more significant? Are they content or burdened or both?\n\nJust as hooks describes her father as one who “exerted control over [her family’s] images,” Leibovitz’s authorship is significant. In the first photograph she actively crafted a presentation of Carly Fiorina that challenges sexist archetypes. She composes a purposefully ambiguous tableau, promoting conflicting observations that emphasized Fiorina’s individuality. In this second image, Leibovitz’s purpose-driven composition has less to do with paradox; instead the viewer is struck by the glaring, unmistakable presence of the man in the portrait, as he stares down over the two justices. It is difficult to ignore the collision between his presence and the women below; at the very least, Leibovitz compels us to acknowledge the gender distinction. As photographer and author, Leibovitz actively selected the setting, the costumes, the lighting, and the pose. hooks remarks that the black community’s access to image-making was liberating, in part, because “subjects [could be] positioned according to individual desire” (59). Her observations suggest that the composition of this image and the specific choices related to that composition are not coincidental but reflect Leibovitz’s specific intent. She positions these two particular women below that particular portrait deliberately in order to elicit a response. Applying hooks’ ideas, it can said that Leibovitz “resist[s] misrepresentation” by producing “alternative images” (60). The man in the portrait takes on a role quite different from his traditional cultural representation. Here, through Leibovitz’s lens, he represents men, as an entire community, and the ever-present sexist subordination of women (even those who hold the country’s highest positions of power). And yet, Ginsburg and O’Connor seem undeterred by this man’s presence; they are not victims of his glance but neither are they detached from it.\n\nhooks accounts for the coexistence of these opposing possibilities (the kind that also arise in the image of Fiorina) as she comments on images from her childhood: “In opposition to colonizing socialization, internalized racism, these walls [of photographs] announced our visual complexity” (61). Again, Leibovitz embraces and calls visual attention to the complexity of the individual; her representation defies narrow definition. The breadth of her subject and title of her book, <em>Women</em>, is playful. As an image-maker with specific intent, her representations of women exploit the expectation that her subject is a singular, identifiable entity. Her portraits of women are multidimensional in themselves, presented in the context of hundreds of other women with diverse backgrounds and experiences.

(222, 5, '2011-12-17 05:22:25', '2011-12-17 05:22:25', '<strong>T</strong>he importance of sovereignty—the ownership of authority in one’s own domain—is a central tenet in Walker Percy’s “The Loss of the Creature,” the second chapter in his book <em>The Message in the Bottle: How Queer Man Is, How Queer Language Is, and What One Has To Do with the Other</em>. According to Percy, we have surrendered our sovereignty to any number of experts, and we “receive experience” (54) as filtered through their opinions and observations. We waive the right to see and know for ourselves, and instead use others’ stories, photographs, and experiences to formulate our own ideas, never confronting the actual thing ourselves. He describes the impossibility of truly seeing when fettered by the constraints of the “preformed symbolic complex” (47), which is, essentially, the baggage that we bring to an experience. He spends much of the essay demonstrating the extent to which we have relinquished our access to our own experiences, and offering solutions for how we might regain this primacy.\r\n\r\nOur challenge, according to Percy, is to overcome the “preformed complex” in order to recover the ability to truly see and experience. While his premise is sound, a lengthy observation in a preschool might have altered Percy’s mission. Percy overlooks young children, a huge segment of our population that is, for a time, largely untouched by this phenomenon of loss of self-determination. They often have the ability to see without the interference of prefabricated mental images, and do not easily surrender their own authority to anyone. Why does Percy not consider that if we focus on the very young, sovereignty might be protected and fostered from the start rather than restored only after its destruction?\r\n\r\nIn the preschool, the individual’s sovereignty enjoys an unfettered reign. This is evident on a very basic level when a child asks me, her teacher,“Did Sam go out?”  When I answer that her friend is still inside, I am initially surprised to feel her push past me to look for him herself. Then, I remember where I am. As the little girl returns, she announces, “You’re right. He isn’t out there.” Among the four and under set, neither my advanced age, nor elevated stature, nor superior status in our classroom is particularly important. While she trusts me, this child must still see for herself that her friend is not where she believes him to be. Moreover, she clearly sees her agreement as something that increases my credibility in this exchange! There is no evidence of this non-expert surrendering her right to do her own “seeing.”\r\n\r\nPreschoolers are that rare segment of the population in which deference to “a privileged knower’s” (54) expertise at the expense of one’s own is an abomination rather than the norm. In this window of time in early childhood, each opinion, or certainly one’s own opinion, is critical in determining the correct solution to a given problem. It is not, in this case, redundant to refer to a “correct solution.” While only one answer satisfies the question, “How many...?” the confident, young child is as apt to question an adult’s counting as her own. There is always room for interpretation, and the most meaningful and truest response is one’s own. What another has determined may or may not be useful to him, or may be stored away for proving or refuting at another time.\r\n\r\nOften the small child plainly notices what we do not. A three-year-old, for example, having heard an unfamiliar word, asks her mother, “What is a louse?” Her parent, a scientist, gives a textbook definition of the creature, and we are all stunned when her child (who does not wash or comb her own hair) brightly replies, “I know that kind of thing. Actually, I think I have a louse!” She is correct, but having no prior knowledge of the reputation of the parasite, she experiences delight rather than alarm about this fact. As Percy might predict, the mother has a clear grasp of what the specimen called “a louse” is but does not seem to have a practical use for this information, as it does not help her to see the vermin before her very eyes. Conversely, the child actively discovers that she knows what an actual louse is, even if she is only now learning the word. Her ability to see has not yet been compromised—it is certainly not lost.\r\n\r\nAccording to Percy, an adult can regain the ability to see. Percy identifies a dialectical tension between access and planning that, he claims, makes seeing virtually impossible when any template is followed. The thing is packaged for consumption—in the case of a lesson, a tourist site or a specimen—and the non-expert becomes a consumer of that pre-packaged knowledge. When someone’s theory supplants a thing for us rather than supplementing our understanding of it, we surrender our sovereignty and defer to a “privileged knower” (54). The meaningful experience garnered by actual confrontation with an object—“penetration of the thing itself” (47)—is lost, and we become consumers of others’ ideas. In the event that we recognize our loss, recovering sovereignty is possible by forging altogether new paths, by delving deeply into a familiar one, or by experiencing a misfortune that disrupts one’s intended means of access. By Percy’s logic, this mother will forevermore be able to identify a louse! Yet, the young child who has not yet succumbed to inevitable consumerism has immediate access.\r\n\r\nThe child becomes the authority on her own surroundings and interests by observation rather than by acceptance of others’ ideas. When motivated by curiosity and guided by their own eyes and ears, children often make accurate inferences based upon their own interpretations of their experiences. They seem to assume the role of ultimate authority with far less effort than their adult counterparts; eavesdrop on a small child and you will find that many ideas are prefaced by exclamations like “Here’s a great idea!” or “I know!”  or the loud command “LET ME SEE!” How might we foster and maintain this exuberance in preschoolers so that it remains beyond the earliest years? Must this sense of the unassailable validity of one’s own opinions, interpretations and accomplishments be lost?\r\n\r\nThe answer is that some amount of this childlike quality must indeed be lost: what is a perfectly acceptable degree of narcissism in a young child is a character defect in an adult. The goal then would be to bring these enviable qualities—confidence, originality and fidelity to one’s own ideas—into balance with the ability to appreciate the contributions of others. The aim would be for the child to weigh and synthesize another’s input without completely subordinating his own. The empathy and discernment ideally exemplified in an adult might be elicited without bringing the small child down a notch, or by “teaching” in a manner that inspires self-doubt. Watching and listening to children reveal how much they comprehend and cobble together without our intervention. What if we allowed them to formulate the questions before we offered up the answers? In a perfect world, there would be a fusion of the child’s own sovereign impressions and the carefully weighed viewpoints of others, none considered to be the expert, as the emphasis would be placed squarely upon the interconnectedness of the knower and the facts of what is known.\r\n\r\nThe loss of sovereignty gradually occurs as a child is increasingly allied with conventional viewpoints, but for the first five years or so most children are content to march to their own internal rhythms. Only after years of observing the ways of the world does the child begin to alter himself to suit established tastes: tantrums are abandoned in favor of “appropriate” behavior, self-consciousness and modesty develop, the awareness that sometimes there is only one correct answer becomes indelibly imprinted on the mind, we stop trying things that might look foolish. The child’s sense of sovereignty is undone bit by bit on a daily basis: we correct pronunciation rather than merely modeling the real words, reject mismatched clothing choices, “teach” them things they will almost certainly learn again later rather than engaging them in subjects that are relevant to their current daily lives. We use “big girl” and “big boy” as forms of the highest praise, we boast of their precociousness and label normal behavior the “terrible twos.” We applaud their ability to mimic and recreate symbols—representations of letters, numbers and objects—but are hardly as enthusiastic in our praise of originality, color choice or vigor. I am suddenly especially cognizant of this tendency during my own gut-wrenching art classes.\r\n\r\nI recently began taking a basic drawing class. My classmates run the gamut from first-year students fulfilling requirements to older professionals with an interest in learning new skills. I do not think that any one of us would identify him- or herself as an artist. Our first assignment was to “do some scribbling” in order to loosen up our hands. There was a pervasive sense of discomfort in the room. I saw others steal furtive glances at my sketchpad, as I silently wondered if I was even doing it correctly. I relate this discomfort to the most prevalent lapse in sovereignty witnessed among preschoolers: the loss of authority over their own creative efforts.\r\n\r\nWhile three- and four-year-olds are usually overwhelmingly comfortable with their own opinions about a multitude of topics, there is one very common exception: many relinquish that autonomy in regard to their drawings and paintings. In preschool, “scribble” or “scribble-scrabble” is a double-edged description of someone’s artwork. While sometimes it is used to indicate a fact—that the drawing is random and non-representational—it is more often a condemnation that the maker cannot yet draw a realistic approximation of a three-dimensional object. As soon as they are able, many children give up the practice of daring, free-form self-expression in favor of rote representations of universally appreciated hearts, rainbows and bright yellow suns with distinctive rays.\r\n\r\nMany of us—children and adults—have traded our unique modes of self-expression for the praise of cherished experts—friends, teachers, siblings and parents. The child who abruptly abandons scribbling in favor of praise-garnering rainbows resembles Percy’s sightseer. The artist no longer experiences the pleasure of discovery, but merely experiences the satisfaction of having the representation conform to the ideal, or, in the case of non-conformity, displeasure at it not being “what it is supposed to be” (47). Some of us give up, dubbing ourselves “bad artists.” Over time, this type of criticism of one’s own expertise and deference to others’ begins to bleed into an increasing number of situations. Soon we are not unlike Percy’s tourists upon arrival at an anticipated site: unhappy at the perceived limitations of our abilities, dissatisfied on account of the disparity between actuality and our expectations (47). Is there any way to avoid this outcome? How might we adapt our way of relating to children that might inure them to the seemingly inevitable loss of self-determination? And what could be gained by encouraging children to maintain this sense of sovereignty?\r\n\r\nPercy ultimately exhorts the educator “to help the student to come to himself not as a consumer of experience but as a sovereign individual” (63). Yet, does this not sound suspiciously similar to that about which Percy warns us? Entrusting teachers with the duty of restoring the student’s sovereignty is akin to the foxes guarding the henhouse—in effect, leaving the deprogramming of the students to one faction of brainwashers. Is this not exactly what Percy describes as “the surrender of the horizon to those experts within whose competence a particular segment of the horizon is thought to lie” (55)? What if we took it on as a societal responsibility rather than giving the authority to any one group of individuals?\r\n\r\nIf we all were to commend the complexity and ingenuity of the thought process as much as we do the correct answer, if we all were to explore and dissect failed attempts with the same fervor as successful ventures, if we all were to truly appreciate the labor and processes involved in learning, would the sheer numbers of innovative solutions to the world’s woes increase exponentially? What if the next time a child starts playing alone, we watch her as intently as she watches us, and give the undivided attention she craves without overshadowing her efforts? It is, perhaps, impractical to think of indulging each child’s every intellectual whim, or even to follow most interesting ideas to fruition or to the point of fizzling out, but it is also bound to be unnecessary. Given proper encouragement and consistent interest, children would be motivated to pursue their own paths independently, just as an adult is motivated to do work that is worthwhile. What if it were the norm to think “outside the box” because no box had been established? Rather than a handful of innovators, perhaps we would have multitudes!

As bombs fell on Iraq, killing thousands of civilians, the survival of one woman rose above all death counts to symbolize glory, hope, and freedom. People across America held their breaths during her captivity and rejoiced when she came home. Our reaction to Private Jessica Lynch’s story speaks volumes about our voracious appetite for sentimentality, as well as the ubiquitous influences of the media and war propaganda. The treatment of this case reflects the tendencies towards sentimentality and symbolization described by Joan Didion in her essay “Sentimental Journeys”; it also exemplifies ideas about war propaganda voiced by H. Bruce Franklin in his piece “From Realism to Virtual Reality: Images of America’s Wars.” Didion and Franklin both discuss the way in which reality can be spun, or downright ignored, to mislead the public. The two authors criticize the extreme power of the media and other institutions to shape our perceptions, both through altering truths and g outright lies.\n\nIn April 2003, the Pentagon stated that Jessica Lynch had been rescued from an Iraqi hospital in a daring display of American military valor. The media then ran with that heroic story to turn Lynch’s tale into one of the most sentimental episodes of the war. An article in the New York Post, for example, was shamelessly headlined “How Daring Midnight Ballet Brought Back Pfc. Jessica From The Enemy''s Evil Clutches” and went on to describe Lynch’s rescue as something out of a Tom Clancy novel (Latham and Sujo). It was not surprising that both the government and the media made an exceedingly big deal out of such an incident. It is not uncommon for a disproportionate amount of attention to be paid to a figure in current events who stands out by being young, attractive, and female. This treatment of Lynch’s story evokes memories of a similar event that was also tremendously sentimentalized: the Central Park Jogger case. Like the story of the Jogger, in which a young woman was brutally attacked in the park in 1989, Jessica Lynch’s story ballooned, thanks to a number of factors, from the wealth of article titles that played off Saving Private Ryan and Kissing Jessica Stein, to the iconic photo of a smiling Jessica in her fatigues against a backdrop of the American flag.\n\nIn her essay “Sentimental Journeys,” which examines the Jogger incident, Joan Didion writes, “Crimes are universally understood to be news to the extent that they offer, however erroneously, a story, a lesson, a higher concept” (255-256). The Jessica Lynch incident was a story better than fiction, and the media was determined to tell that story for maximum effect. It tugged heartstrings by voyaging beyond Lynch’s capture and rescue, delving into the heart and soul of the petite blonde who wanted to be an elementary school teacher, just as fourteen years earlier the media had highlighted the jogger’s “top-notch work” and her fun-loving personality (Didion 253). The two women, both undue victims and miraculous survivors, were turned into symbols—the jogger of what was right with New York, and Lynch of what was right with America. The story of Jessica Lynch’s ordeal, replete with teary-eyed mothers and picture-perfect reunion, ranks right up there with the Central Park Jogger’s story as one of the most sentimental narratives in recent memory.\n\nIn “Sentimental Journeys,” Didion claims, “cases are widely regarded by the American reporters as windows on the city or culture in which they take place” (308). Jayson Blair, the New York Times reporter who was later accused of plagiarism, used Lynch’s story as a window into Appalachia. In an article that he claimed was based on interviews witly, Blair wrote:\n\nMr. Lynch seemed distracted as he stood on the porch of his hilltop home here looking into the tobacco fields and pastures. He talked about the satellite television service that brought CNN and other cable news networks into his home, his family''s long history of military service and the poor condition of the local economy ("Relatives”).\n\nIts promise of giving Americans insight into a region of the country few people knew much about was one of the reasons why Jessica Lynch’s story was a media goldmine. Reporters edged their way into the tight-knit Lynch family, invading their home in an attempt to show the rest of the country about the environment from which Jessica hailed. The “opportunity to enter not only households but parts of the culture normally closed” was another factor that made the Lynch case so susceptible to becoming a sentimental, overexposed narrative (Didion 308).\n\nBut Lynch’s story has another aspect to it, besides being an archetypal tale about the trials and tribulations of a young white female and a window into a relatively unseen culture: it’s a war story. Lynch was fashioned into the type of propagandist symbol that has long characterized American military conflicts. In “From Realism to Virtual Reality: Images of America’s Wars,” H. Bruce Franklin discusses the historical use of these propaganda techniques, which have proven to be especially potent in controversial wars such as those in Vietnam and Iraq. Lynch’s ordeal not only helped garner support for US involvement in Iraq, but it embedded in the minds of Americans a concrete image of the people who had been deployed there. Lynch was an example of how the government wanted all soldiers to be seen: as kind and caring, patriotic and passionate.\n\nFurthermore, Lynch helped show that the military was not a selfish institution that sent young people towards danger or death without giving them something in return. The military had done great things for Jessica Lynch: it had provided her with a means of escape from stifling, rural West Virginia; it had allowed her to travel the world; and it would fund a college education that would enable her better to serve society. She was the perfect symbol of all that could be gained from joining the military. The US army could not have picked a better poster girl.\n\nWhen the celebration over Lynch’s rescue died down, it became evident that many of the “facts” in the story were closer to fiction. For example, injuries that the Pentagon claimed Lynch sustained by fighting against Iraqi soldiers turned out to be the result of a Hummer crash. Furthermore, Lynch had been “imprisoned” in a hospital devoid of Iraqi military personnel, where she was assigned the only specialist bed in the hospital and one of only two nurses on the floor (Kampfner). Confronted with public distrust in both itself and the Pentagon, the media were driven to reexamine what had occurred.\n\nRevisiting the details of this incident allowed the media to prove its commitment to the truth. <em>The New York Times</em> tackled the alteration of Lynch’s story in an article correcting the untruths propagated by Jayson Blair. In the correction, Jessica Lynch’s sister Brandi said that Blair’s assertion that tobacco fields and cattle pastures were visible from the porch of the Lynch home was completely false (“Correcting the Record”). By drawing attention to such inaccuracies, the <em>New York Times</em> convinced its readers that it was concerned with the truth, and that all the propaganda machines and corrupt journalists in the world would not stop it from continuing to serve the reader; the newspaper came off as honorable, despite the fact that it had misled the public in the first place.\n\nOther media outlets criticized not themselves but their peers in their attempt to gain the public’s trust. When CBS was criticized for pitching a massive multimedia deal to Lynch’s family while she was still hospitalized, the network defended itself by saying, “Unlike the <em>New York Times</em>'' own ethical problems, there is no question about the accuracy or integrity of CBS News'' reporting” (Haberman). Some of the proposed ideas that made CBS so desperate for the rights to tell Lynch’s story included a TV movie through it’s “movie division, which specializes in inspirational stories of courage" (Haberman) and an MTV concert in Lynch’s honor, to be aired from her hometown. While CBS might not have committed outright plagiarism, their aggression, their shameless pursuit of the story’s rights, and their apparent determination to make a profit from the incident were far from innocent. But through the use of statements that insulted the <em>New York Times</em>, CBS helped detract the blame from itself and disguise the fact that it was just as eager as Blair to sentimentalize and sensationalize Lynch''s story.\n\nNewpapers and networks are not the only ones to have twisted the truth about Lynch’s rescue. By having a hidden camera film the Navy SEALS operation that released Lynch from the Iraqi hospital, the military did just as much to make Lynch’s rescue into an exciting story as any network. As one writer put it, “"It was like a Hollywood film. [The soliders] cried, ''Go, go, go'', with guns and blanks and the sound of explosions. They made a show--an action movie like Sylvester Stallone or Jackie Chan, with jumping and shouting, breaking down doors. All the time with the camera rolling” (Kampfner). Many people were angered by the excessive importance placed on taping the rescue, as Franklin argues, reflecting their disapproval of the role of photographers and videographers in the midst of war. He describes a comic book published after the Vietnam War that depicted photojournalists as villains screaming “Keep shooting, keep shooting!” (Franklin 61). This double entendre criticizes the emphasis placed on getting good images, a goal that can overshadow the true purpose of a mission. The Pentagon’s determination to videotape Lynch’s rescue, and its similar resolve to acquire high-quality photos and videos of the conflict in Vietnam, suggest that the military’s priorities lay not so much in the actual conduct of war but in its portrayal. The military is just as much at fault as the networks for turning war into a sometimes heartwarming, sometimes horrific narrative.\n\nJessica Lynch’s story will be retold in November 2003, when NBC’s made-for-TV movie “Saving Private Lynch” is broadcast into homes across America. Movies have long been used to change our ideas of historical events, and, as Franklin notes, such movies and stories are “an effective vehicle for romanticizing and popularizing war” (53). Many movies about the Vietnam War, for example, sought to “reverse the roles of victim and victimizer” (Franklin 59) and to “radically [reimagine] the war” (Franklin 57). The pervasive feeling surrounding “Saving Private Lynch,” as expressed in an abundance of news articles in the Fall of 2003, is that the movie will likely veer from reality.\n\nTo defend itself, the media has directly addressed this negative publicity. The writer of the script said in an interview:\n\nI had to give the network attorneys the information in every scene as to what exact magazine, what exact article, what page I got the content from. That went to the legal department with a photocopy of the articles. They then would double- and triple-check what version could be O.K. to use ("Saving Private Lynch").\n\nFasano’s disclaimer-filled comments, in which he goes so far as to say “Please . . . Don’t shoot the messenger,” seek to defend the media’s versions of events (“Saving Private Lynch”). But while this version may claim to be painstakingly researched, when the movie airs we will likely be presented with a sensationalized, twisted story. No one is going to make a movie about an America POW in no imminent danger, being given TLC by Iraqi nurses, which is the plotline that the facts about Lynch’s capture actually point to. The history of war movies, as Franklin says, is a history of skewed reality, and “Saving Private Lynch”is not expected to be any different.\n\nCriticizing the truth-twisting tactics employed by the government gave both the public and the media an opportunity to make opinionated statements about the conflict in Iraq. In a time when the Dixie Chicks were vilified for one anti-Bush comment, attacking the Lynch incident was safer than attacking the country, government, or president in general. Analyzing the holes in the story was a way of expressing disapproval of the war. Just as Jessica Lynch was a positive symbol for the war and the military, the skewing of her story became a negative symbol for the lies surrounding the war. Throughout the course of the war, numerous statements of arguable legitimacy had been thrown at the American public, mainly concerning Iraq’s possession of chemical and biological weapons. Many people expressed their general outrage at these widespread lies by focusing on the Lynch case as a specific example of this deception.\n\nIn a <em>New York Times</em> editorial, Nicholas Kristoff wrote that the public had been “misled” by reports that Lynch had fired at her captors, that she had been seriously injured, etc., commenting that, “As a citizen, I deeply resent my government trying to spin me like a Ping-Pong ball” (“Saving Private Jessica”). The resentment of this one event, as expressed in the numerous editorials and letters like Kristoff’s, allowed people to vocalize their overall resentment of the war. Lynch’s ordeal became a sounding board for those who felt the war itself was unjust.\n\nAs new facts come to light, and Jessica Lynch’s story is retold in new ways, the media’s portrayal of the story has been challenged. Perhaps the greatest power to retell the story belongs to Lynch herself. Lynch, who recently was honorably discharged from the army, has already signed a book deal. The Central Park Jogger, who came forth and identified herself as a woman named Trisha Meili, told her story in last year’s memoir,<em> I Am The Central Park Jogger</em>. We cannot know in advance whether Lynch’s account of her ordeal will veer towards sentimentality or hard cold facts, whether it will exalt or denounce the US military. But a story is a multi-dimensional object, a confluence of many sources of information. The stories of Lynch and Meili are already engraved in our minds in ways that their own words may be powerless to alter. When the media presents us with a packaged story that is complete with excitement and closure, then a woman suffering from amnesia (like both Lynch and Meili), despite her position as the story’s heroine, is almost powerless to unwrap that package and shine her on what’s inside.\n\nJessica Lynch has been called many things: an icon, a heroine, a “wholesome West Virginia country girl” (Linda Davies, qtd. in Jehl and Blair). In the years to come her story will no doubt be told and retold, made into legend and attacked with fervor. But what will not change, regardless of the books published and movies made, is the power the incident had over the American public in 2003, as our country engaged in a conflict that promised to end quickly but instead dragged on mercilessly. As both a propaganda tool and a sentimental narrative, Lynch demonstrated just how capable the government and media are of selling us an alternative version of the truth. Cases like hers might harm our trust in reported news, but considering our insatiable appetite for great stories, we cannot expect the news to cut back on how much fiction it reports as fact. The next time we go to war, or the next time a young woman survives a harrowing ordeal, the truth will no doubt continue to be molded and manipulated to our liking. That is how it has been for hundred of years, and how it will continue to be.', 'Spins, Sentiment, and Sensationalism: The Jessica Lynch Story', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '302-autosave', '', '', '2012-02-27 14:58:49', '2012-02-27 14:58:49', '', 302, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?p=427', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The portion of his face not obscured by his thin arm looks almost peaceful—eyes closed, blemish-free. He is not a victim of physical violence or torture; instead, his body is slowly, meticulously, shutting itself down. He is starving to death. One could mistake his big toe for a pebble. Dust clings to his skin. I fear that he might soon dissolve into the ground. But he is resting. The caption of Australian photographer Daniel Berehulak’s photograph taken during the 2005 famine in Niger, titled “Let Me Rest A Little, Brother,” informs the viewer that the young boy is resting, not dead, and that the even smaller boy standing above him, gazing into the camera with desperate, piercing eyes imploring help, is his brother. Legs dangling from a broken-down wagon with just one wheel is all we see of a third figure in the photo. I saw this image in an online photo essay and felt shock, sadness, anger. The onlookers in the photograph somehow, perhaps counterintuitively, augment the helplessness of the prostrate child, asking “What can we do?” The immobility of the wagon asks, “Where can we go?” The child’s small, dusty, naked body implies, “It is too late.”\r\n\r\nThe anger I felt at the injustice shown—at the inability of the boy’s family to help him, to feed him—followed by my longing to help him myself corresponds to sociomedical scientist Robert Sember’s idea that “the power of images lies in their capacity both to convey information and to evoke reaction, often in the form of a feeling or an impulse” (1626). Most would agree that photographs, especially those of suffering, almost necessarily evoke reaction. They are intrinsically shocking and saddening due to the nature of what they depict. A person’s reaction to a photo, however, can be many things—shallow, misinformed, under-informed, personal, biased. Sometimes there is knowing recognition. Sometimes the image is totally alien, unfamiliar. Either way, the viewer’s understanding of the photo directly influences his or her reaction.\r\n\r\nWriter and activist Susan Sontag offers one perspective on the way people view images of suffering. She contends that “harrowing photographs do not inevitably lose their power to shock, but they do not help us much to understand. Narratives can make us understand. Photographs do something else: they haunt us” (94-5). The viewer feels shock and sadness, but does not “get it.” This produces what can be called a “shallow” reaction, wherein the photograph simply does not reveal enough for the viewer to have a contextual understanding of the events portrayed. The image requires a narrative; perhaps a textual explanation of the economic, political, social, and environmental factors surrounding the food crisis in Niger must be examined before the full impact of Berehulak’s photo can set in.\r\n\r\nSontag’s view contrasts with Sember’s understanding of images as “a way of knowing, not in the narrow sense of containing information but in the more profound sense of making information meaningful” (1627). In his article, “Images in Public Health,” Sember supports the addition of pictures to the pages of the <em>American Journal of Public Health</em>. He asserts that the photographs themselves underscore and strengthen the content of public health scholarship because they provide added depth to the issues. According to this argument, a photograph provides the context that a narrative lacks. These views are paradoxical when considered together, but neither one is necessarily wrong. Whether the viewer derives context and a greater understanding from a photograph or from a narrative is irrelevant. Highly relevant and important, however, is that the viewer does obtain a deep (i.e. “non-shallow”) understanding of what he views, as contextual understanding may be considered an essential prerequisite for effective action, which is the next logical “feeling or impulse” (Sember 1626).\r\n\r\nBerehulak’s “Let Me Rest A Little, Brother” likely arouses in many viewers a desire to take action and alleviate the children’s suffering. Those who saw the photograph immediately after publication were confronted with an image of urgent famine—the awareness that two hundred, two thousand, or ten thousand miles away, at any given moment, a child was starving to death. Those who see the photograph today know that the effects of a four-year-old famine have not vanished. Sontag acknowledges that the desire to take action against an atrocity is strongest when something can be readily done about the situation at hand. In discussing the photos of the My Lai massacre released in March 1968, she writes, “we could feel an obligation to look at these pictures, gruesome as they were, because there was something to be done, right now, about what they depicted” (95). This logic is compelling. After all, what of the adage “Don’t cry over spilled milk”—things that can be helped are the things worth acting on. Surely this expression is far too caustic and insensitive—dismissing the importance of memorialization—but it does not fit for another reason as well.\r\n\r\nBefore discussing this reason, though, the concept of memorialization requires further explanation. In her piece “Surviving Images: Holocaust Photographs and the Work of Postmemory,” Marianne Hirsch uses the term “postmemory” to describe “the relationship of children of survivors of cultural or collective trauma to the experiences of their parents, experiences that they ‘remember’ only as the narratives and images with which they grew up, but that are so powerful, so monumental, as to constitute memories in their own right” (9). She develops her concept of “postmemory” specifically with respect to the Holocaust. Hirsch espouses a different kind of photography-induced action—one as important to the discussion of humanely and productively viewing images as intervention-oriented action. The action of the postmemorial generation is to cope. In Hirsch’s words, “the postmemorial generation—in displacing and recontextualizing these well known images—has been able to make the repetition [of the same Holocaust images] a mostly helpful vehicle of working through a traumatic past” (8). The two forms of action—let us say, “interventionist” and “memorialist”— seem radically dissimilar, but really only differ in the sentiment with which the actor in each situation views a given image. In Sontag’s interventionism, action is taken to change a current atrocity from the outside. In Hirsch’s memorialism, action is taken to reconcile oneself with a past atrocity from the inside.\r\n\r\nBut these two forms of action can be reconciled. Images of suffering, whether of wars past, of current famines, or of violence, represent and depict events that are happening now or will most likely happen again. Truly singular events may seem like exceptions—the bombing of Nagasaki, the firebombing of Dresden, the effects of apartheid in South Africa. The systematic mass slaughter of European Jews in Nazi concentration camps during the Second World War put an indefinite moratorium on the use of the word “holocaust” in almost all discourse for a reason. But all of these atrocities had similar human effects. The Holocaust is unparalleled for many different reasons while, say, famine in Ethiopia has occurred at least four times in the past century and may very well happen another four times in the next, but their effects are alike (Kiros 16-19). Those affected by any aforementioned event dealt with heart-wrenching injustice, intense pain, and disabling sorrow. They all faced death. Berehulak’s subject felt the same hunger in Douloukou in 2005 that a boy his age in a 1941 Warsaw ghetto felt. Because of this, the date of a given photo becomes tangential to our processing of its meaning.\r\n\r\nOur reaction to Berehulak’s photo ought not be necessarily more profound than our reaction to images of famine in India in the 1960s, for example, though the latter happened “in the past.” Our intervention will be more conventionally fruitful in Niger, affecting change in an ongoing situation, but the mere fact that images of famine exist, past and present, makes the matter continually pressing. This is not to say that all atrocities depicted by images of suffering are the same; it is enormously important to recognize the different contexts of suffering, to obtain understanding. But distinguishing events only to establish temporality of suffering is harmful. Events are temporal, but suffering is tragically mired in perpetuity. As such, images should not be looked upon solely to work through trauma of the past, or to understand why events happened, but instead should always be regarded with the consciousness that events that produce the same or similar images are recurring or could recur. This explains why the aforementioned adage fails to apply—the milk is never spilled, <em>it is always spilling</em>, so long as there is war, violence, hunger, hatred.\r\n\r\nInterventionist action, addressed by Sontag, works because it provides concrete results. But a certain limitation almost always comes with interventionism. People are compelled to act on what they see from the “outside.” The sympathetic viewer of an image of suffering wants to do something, but approaches his intervention the first way he can think of, as an outsider. “He” will help “them.” This incurs certain dangers. Arthur and Joan Kleinman write in their essay, “The Appeal of Experience; The Dismay of Images: Cultural Appropriations of Suffering in Our Times,” that famine (and for our purposes we can add other sufferings—violence, war, etc.) is culturally presented in a way that misrepresents the affected populations (7). They find that the portrayal of famine as “the experience of a lone individual” leads to labeling localities as “irrational” or “self-destructive,” which finally results in the local world being “deemed incompetent, or worse” (7-8). Their solution is to “humanize intervention,” but crafting the humane responses Kleinman and Kleinman seek requires a different approach to images.\r\n\r\nHirsch, through her discussion of the postmemorial generation, provides this new approach. Members of the postmemorial generation, because they are the children of victims, find more significance in photos of their parents’ suffering than do others. The bond between the two generations bears enough strength that members of the second generation do not view images with an outsider’s eye, but in fact work through trauma themselves. In essence, postmemorial viewers look at images of suffering with empathy. They feel a real, visceral sorrow for the victims they are seeing, a sorrow with which they <em>identify</em>. They are on the “inside”—not because they suffered themselves, but because their empathy with their parents’ suffering is so profound. This is different from the feelings of other viewers, of Sontag’s interventionists, who feel a profound sympathy for those suffering before the lens, but who can truly only feel <em>for</em> them. As Sontag puts it, “‘We’—this ‘we’ is everyone who has never experienced anything like what they went through—don’t understand. We don’t get it” (98).\r\n\r\nTherefore, the danger in “outsider” intervention can be eliminated if people conscientiously place themselves in the role of a member of the postmemorial generation without actually having family members who have experienced the situations they are viewing, and yet still maintain their gut reaction to intervene. A person attempting to view images of suffering in the most humane and productive way possible, in the “right” way (as in rectitude), must go much further than simply to react sympathetically to photographs of victims. He must make the decision to intervene according to his means—through contributions or even on-site humanitarian work, of course, but as importantly, through advocacy and support, education, political participation, basic discourse. And most of all, he must make the effort to intervene as if he has a personal stake in the results—because he understands that he actually <em>does</em> have a personal stake in the results. He puts himself as close as possible to the people he is trying to help: in sentiment, in thought. He has no prideful sense of philanthropy because he feels that he is on the inside. He is generationally connected—not by blood, but by the bond of humanity.\r\n\r\nAchieving this perspective is not necessarily easy, though Susan Sontag provides one method of accomplishing this by an example from her own life. In 1993, Sontag lived in Sarajevo during the siege, where she directed Samuel Beckett’s <em>Waiting for Godot</em>. After the opening performance, Sarajevo’s mayor declared her an honorary citizen, conceivably for taking such a profound interest in the people of the city when much of the world remained indifferent. In a 2004 interview, Sontag said that “it’s hard to make that effort to think how the other person feels. But that’s really what a moral life is, and ethical life is” (Bill Moyers Jounal Transcripts). With these ideas of “honorary citizenship” and “ethical life,” Sontag shows a method by which one can achieve a postmemorialist perspective on the suffering of peoples everywhere. Empathy can be achieved by acknowledging the necessity of “putting yourself in someone else’s shoes.”\r\n\r\nThe most productive and humane result will come of viewing images of suffering when we attain this position, either how Sontag did it or in some other way. Better yet, Kleinman and Kleinman’s idea, cited by Sember—that “images will be used for sentimental effect, a form of privileged catharsis in which a swell of sympathy for those who are less fortunate than ourselves is an end in itself” (1628)— becomes very unlikely if people place themselves in a hybrid interventionist-memorialist position. Combining elements of both, the viewer can intervene in atrocities while respecting “the interpersonal space of suffering, the local, ethnographic context of action,” effectively from the “inside,” because the atrocities are so shocking to him that they eradicate any haughty, or even modest, conceptions of “us” and “them” (Kleinman and Kleinman 18). Shock translates to sharply perceptive empathy, not tidy sympathy, because the viewer of photography of war, famine or violence feels more than an obligation to help the people suffering. He feels that, in a way, he too is suffering. This hybrid position, albeit idealistic to expect of all, can provide a greater sense of humanity to the conscientious viewer—one that ties him or her to every other individual in the world in memorial sentiment and in obligation—so that Sontag’s notion, of the“breathtaking provinciality” of speaking of reality as spectacle, becomes unthinkable (97).\r\n\r\nDaniel Berehulak photographed a starving child in Niger and titled his piece “Let Me Rest a Little, Brother.” It almost makes me cry.

In essence, postmemorial viewers look at images of suffering with empathy. They feel a real, visceral sorrow for the victims they are seeing, a sorrow with which they <em>identify</em>. They are on the “inside”—not because they suffered themselves, but because their empathy with their parents’ suffering is so profound. This is different from the feelings of other viewers, of Sontag’s interventionists, who feel a profound sympathy for those suffering before the lens, but who can truly only feel <em>for</em> them. As Sontag puts it, “‘We’—this ‘we’ is everyone who has never experienced anything like what they went through—don’t understand. We don’t get it” (98).\n\nTherefore, the danger in “outsider” intervention can be eliminated if people conscientiously place themselves in the role of a member of the postmemorial generation without actually having family members who have experienced the situations they are viewing, and yet still maintain their gut reaction to intervene. A person attempting to view images of suffering in the most humane and productive way possible, in the “right” way (as in rectitude), must go much further than simply to react sympathetically to photographs of victims. He must make the decision to intervene according to his means—through contributions or even on-site humanitarian work, of course, but as importantly, through advocacy and support, education, political participation, basic discourse. And most of all, he must make the effort to intervene as if he has a personal stake in the results—because he understands that he actually <em>does</em> have a personal stake in the results. He puts himself as close as possible to the people he is trying to help: in sentiment, in thought. He has no prideful sense of philanthropy because he feels that he is on the inside. He is generationally connected—not by blood, but by the bond of humanity.\n\nAchieving this perspective is not necessarily easy, though Susan Sontag provides one method of accomplishing this by an example from her own life. In 1993, Sontag lived in Sarajevo during the siege, where she directed Samuel Beckett’s <em>Waiting for Godot</em>. After the opening performance, Sarajevo’s mayor declared her an honorary citizen, conceivably for taking such a profound interest in the people of the city when much of the world remained indifferent. In a 2004 interview, Sontag said that “it’s hard to make that effort to think how the other person feels. But that’s really what a moral life is, and ethical life is” (Bill Moyers Jounal Transcripts). With these ideas of “honorary citizenship” and “ethical life,” Sontag shows a method by which one can achieve a postmemorialist perspective on the suffering of peoples everywhere. Empathy can be achieved by acknowledging the necessity of “putting yourself in someone else’s shoes.”\n\nThe most productive and humane result will come of viewing images of suffering when we attain this position, either how Sontag did it or in some other way. Better yet, Kleinman and Kleinman’s idea, cited by Sember—that “images will be used for sentimental effect, a form of privileged catharsis in which a swell of sympathy for those who are less fortunate than ourselves is an end in itself” (1628)— becomes very unlikely if people place themselves in a hybrid interventionist-memorialist position. Combining elements of both, the viewer can intervene in atrocities while respecting “the interpersonal space of suffering, the local, ethnographic context of action,” effectively from the “inside,” because the atrocities are so shocking to him that they eradicate any haughty, or even modest, conceptions of “us” and “them” (Kleinman and Kleinman 18). Shock translates to sharply perceptive empathy, not tidy sympathy, because the viewer of photography of war, famine or violence feels more than an obligation to help the people suffering. He feels that, in a way, he too is suffering. This hybrid position, albeit idealistic to expect of all, can provide a greater sense of humanity to the conscientious viewer—one that ties him or her to every other individual in the world in memorial sentiment and in obligation—so that Sontag’s notion, of the“breathtaking provinciality” of speaking of reality as spectacle, becomes unthinkable (97).\n\nDaniel Berehulak photographed a starving child in Niger and titled his piece “Let Me Rest a Little, Brother.” It almost makes me cry. I feel a little ill. I want to help him because I can, and because I must. Because that “Brother” is me.\n\n[caption id="attachment_47" align="alignright" width="496" caption="Girma_E2_clip_image002"]<img class="size-full wp-image-47 " title="Girma_E2_clip_image002" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Girma_E2_clip_image002.jpg" alt="Girma_E2_clip_image002" width="496" height="336" />[/caption]', 'Let Me Rest a Little, Humankind', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '223-autosave', '', '', '2012-03-23 15:25:46', '2012-03-23 15:25:46', '', 223, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?p=224', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
(225, 5, '2011-12-17 05:26:56', '2011-12-17 05:26:56', '<em>Saturday Night Live</em> is infamous for its humor, which walks the line between social commentary and pure amusement. While its performers and characters have been able to use the show as a platform for future successes in comedy, few have had as great success and notoriety as the Lonely Island. Perhaps better known for their front man, Andy Samberg, the Lonely Island is a group of three friends: Samberg, Akiva Schaffer, and Jorma Taccone. The three produce, direct, and star in a series of digital shorts, or music videos, that appear on the show. In 2009 they released their first album of songs, which has been labeled by providers as comedy.\r\n\r\nTheir success is likely due to the forward nature of their work. Their songs, delivered as parodies of hip-hop, R&amp;B, and rap, range from love poems to Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to tales of premature ejaculation. “Lazy Sunday,” the group’s breakout video from 2005 featuring Samberg and SNL cast member Chris Parnell, is surprising. The loud, threatening backbeat brings to mind rattling chains. Their words are shouted at the camera, which hides the message at first. No, the two are not rapping about the ills of the South Bronx or Brooklyn, but the leisures of Manhattan life delivered as “gangsta rap.” The song has been heralded as “poking fun” or parodying rap music. Parody is more than a humorous rendering of a subject. Seymour Chatman, an American film and literary critic, has defined parody as a form of word play that “imitates an original by substituting as little as possible” (28). He identifies the importance of parody by its ability to imitate the original work’s style while using it as a “vehicle for baser, more vulgar, or other inappropriate content” (30).\r\n\r\nApplying the term “inappropriate” to “Lazy Sunday” seems unsuitable. “Inappropriate” degrades the new content in comparison to the original. While it is possible to view humorous shorts by the Lonely Island such as “Lazy Sunday” as parodies, the idea that their content is “inappropriate,” or of lesser value, than traditional rap songs is problematic. Instead, the shorts should be viewed as using rap for its traditional purpose to expose and critique the creator’s environment.\r\n\r\nRap is more than just a musical genre of spoken rhyme over a beat. In order to understand the musical and cultural importance of rap music, it is necessary to visualize its history. William Eric Perkins, editor of<em>Droppin’ Science: Critical Essays on Rap Music and Hip Hop Culture</em>, describes the evolution of rap in his essay, “The Rap Attack.” Some trace its development back to Africa, where oral communication and ritual chanting, such as call-and-response, were important and revered traditions. Others compare it to slave work songs, improvisational jazz and blues from the early 20th century, and poetry of the Black Arts Movement. All agree that the creation of rap is inextricably linked to African-American culture. It wasn’t until the late ’70s, as the technology for deejaying and mixing records developed, that rap exploded as a new genre with artists like Afrika Bambaataa and the Sugar Hill Gang. The constant beat created by those new technologies has remained one of the most important parts of the music.\r\n\r\nThe lyrics sung over the beat, like the lyrics of many other genres, have overcome the music to represent the work. Rap’s lyrics have a strong narrative element that lends itself to storytelling and oratory. Combined with its connection to African tradition and heritage, rap has emerged as the genre used by marginalized African-Americans to call attention to their status in society. There has always been a critical aspect of rap, whether in competitions between deejays who use their songs to highlight their accomplishments and their opponents’ shortcomings or simple boasting and displays of masculinity. Yet when combined with growing dissatisfaction with second-class citizenship and poor living standards, rap became a form of socio-economic expression. As the raps produced by these circumstances became successful, they were embraced by youth of all races, which caused a mainstream backlash. Today, it is hard to separate the cultural importance of rap from the musical one.\r\n\r\nTricia Rose, author of <em>Black Noise: Rap Music and Black Culture in Contemporary America</em>, broadly defines the genre as “a black cultural expression that prioritizes black voices from the margins of urban America” (2). Furthermore, she identifies rap’s primary thematic concerns as identity and location. Different varieties of rap address these concerns in different ways. “Gangsta” rap, based on experiences with gang violence, police run-ins, and general discontent in urban areas, especially Los Angeles, uses location to determine identity. The tone of these songs is aggressive and the words are charged. The songs attempt to bring critical attention to the inequality experienced by blacks in urban areas.\r\n\r\nAccording to Chatman, the tension between the original style (what is being copied) and new content (how it appears) determines the sense of inappropriateness necessary for a parody. Such a tension exists in “Lazy Sunday.” “Lazy Sunday” is the story of two white men, young and middle class, wasting their Sunday with a quest to see the newly released <em>Chronicles of Narnia</em>. The Lonely Island is describing a stereotypical American experience; however, they do so in an atypical style: gangsta rap. This contrast between the content and its description is the most striking part of the song and evident within the portrayal, themes, and word choice of the song.\r\n\r\nThe video is immediately misleading. It hides its content behind a stereotypical opening for a gangsta rap video: images of city streets, old buildings, and cars, typical views of the neighborhood. It isn’t until the camera cuts to Andy Samberg in a clean studio apartment that the video, and the audience’s perception of it, veers from a traditional path and becomes a farce. Yet the song continues to keep its focus on the neighborhood with references to notable destinations, such as Magnolia Bakery, and scenes walking down the street and in an abandoned park. This matches one of the primary themes of gangsta rap previously defined: location. Tricia Rose explains:\r\n\r\nNothing is more central to rap’s music video narrative than situating the rapper in his or her milieu and among one’s crew or posse. Unlike heavy metal music videos, for example, which often use dramatic live concert footage and the concert stage as the core location, rap music videos are set on buses, subways, in abandoned buildings, and almost always in black urban inner-city locations (10).\r\n\r\nThis focus on location in turn emphasizes rap’s other thematic concern, identity, as the songs are often ways to validate the home of the rapper: “Rappers’ emphasis on posses and neighborhoods has brought the ghetto back into the public consciousness. It satisfies poor young black people’s profound need to have their territories acknowledged, recognized, and celebrated” (11).  The Lonely Island is doing the same thing; they are situating themselves in their neighborhood in order to acknowledge and celebrate it. Why, then, is “Lazy Sunday” considered a parody and not a rap song?\r\n\r\nThe nuances of parody should be considered. Chatman refines his definition of parody to explain that stylistic parody depends on the audience’s familiarity with both the original author’s style and new subject matter’s inappropriateness. “The audience must not only recognize the original, but sense that the style is being used to express a content which the targeted author could or would not contemplate,” Chatman explains (36-7). A comparison between the notable gangsta rap group N.W.A. and the Lonely Island illuminates this tension. N.W.A., comprised of MCs Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, Ice Cube, MC Ren, and Ice-T, was one of the most controversial gangsta rap groups as well as one of the groups that gave the genre its direction.  Drawing from their experiences in Compton, a city in South Los Angeles County, N.W.A. brutally described the injustices of their community, especially those caused by the police. Ahmir “?uestlove” Thompson writes for <em>Rolling Stone’s</em> series “The Immortals: The 100 Greatest Artists of all Time”: “Even if you’ve never lived through all the gangbanging and police harassment they were talking about, you could tell there was truth there.”\r\n\r\nWhile N.W.A. clearly draws upon their neighborhood for inspiration and setting, their work transcends the specific location to rage out against the system at large. In their song, “F*** the Police,” they imitate a court trial of “N.W.A. versus the police department.” With guns going off in the background, Ice Cube sings, “Just cuz I’m from the CPT, punk police are afraid of me.” CPT, an abbreviation for Compton, becomes a charged word; it assumes that the listener will be familiar with its place and its story. In another song, “Straight Outta Compton,” the rappers pass the narrative of the song with a call-and-response: the call “Tell ’em where you from!” is answered with the line, “Straight outta Compton!” The video is more explicit in its commentary with its images of cops strapping on guns while looking at maps of Compton paired with the rappers sitting around burning trashcans and running from the police. Their work created the infamous image of Compton, which is now synonymous with gang-related crime and police violence.\r\n\r\nThe Upper West Side is the polar opposite of Compton. Yet the Lonely Island uses its reputation in the same way rappers now use Compton: to acknowledge a neighborhood, to establish identity, and to evoke an image. They exhibit their own street knowledge by knowing where to purchase the best cupcakes, “No doubt that bakery’s got all da bomb frostins,” and sneaking their own food into the movie theater, “The theater’s over-priced./You’ve got the backpack?/Gonna pack it up nice.” They recall aspects of New York City that are universally known, such as Magnolia and “Friends.” The images their “streets” invoke and the way they portray themselves are trivial in comparison to Compton and the attitudes of N.W.A.’s members. Samberg and Parnell need a search engine to find their way to the movie theater, and then end up in the back seat of a taxicab. While they may act tough by having a “snack attack” and sneaking food into a theater, they also consider the risks: “don’t want security to get suspicious.” Eazy-E, on the other hand, flaunts his actually toughness in “Straight Outta Compton”: “I see a motherf***** cop, I don’t dodge him.”  Finally, the gun shots heard in the background as the duo eats their cupcakes adds the coup de grâce. The probability of hearing guns shots on the Upper West Side is next to none. The Lonely Island is trying to transform their neighborhood into a “‘hood,” but is only making themselves seem like “posers.”\r\nWhile the Lonely Island convincingly copies the musical style of gangsta rap, their word choice and figures of speech accentuate the inappropriateness of their new content. Describing frosting as “da bomb” or the directions to the theater as the “dopest route” may be appropriate speech in rap, but when applied to locations in the stereotypical “intellectual” neighborhood of the Upper West Side, it comes out ridiculous. Even more ridiculous are the references the pair makes. They constantly refer to classic chick-flicks, “I love those cupcakes more than McAdams loves Gosling,” and they use the line “Girl actin’ like she never see a $10 before/ It’s all about the Hamiltons, baby.” This is a clear reference to the slang term for hundred dollar bills, “Benjamins.” Songs like Puff Daddy’s “It’s All About the Benjamins” focus solely on spending money, with lines like “I’m only here/For that green paper with the eagle.” Parnell and Samberg take these references to money even further though, with an easy-to-miss historical reference: “You can call us Aaron Burr/From the way we’re droppin’ Hamiltons.”  “Gangstas” quoting American history hardly seems appropriate and yet for once the duo does something that isn’t out of place for their neighborhood.\r\n\r\nThrough these dedications to the original form and incongruities consistent with their personal identities and backgrounds, the Lonely Island creates a humorous song that could be considered a parody. However, that interpretation is complicated by Chatman’s inclusion of another component of parody: a parody must “utilize the original writer’s diction and style, but follow a train of thought precisely along the lines that he would have pursued from the given premise” (36). It is hard to imagine a group like N.W.A. singing about a lazy Sunday spent in bed followed by neighborhood shenanigans. The comfortable bourgeois lifestyle that allows for a Sunday spent in such a manner is not one that typically can be found in the ’hood or ghetto. In fact, the forced aggressive tone of “Lazy Sunday” violates one of the central attractions of rap for youth, especially middle-class white youth: authenticity. Perkins writes about the appeal of gangsta rap:\r\n“In an age of mass overconsumption and media hype, gangsta rap no doubt represents a religion and ideology of authenticity . . . These abstract slogans of ‘bein’ and stayin’ real’ summon up romantic notions of ghetto authenticity . . . Hip hop speaks to youth’s desire for identity, for a sense of self-definition and purpose, no matter how lawless or pointless” (20).\r\n\r\nPerhaps this is what attracted Andy Samberg and his fellow Lonely Island members to rap in the first place. In an interview conducted with Jason Gay from <em>Rolling Stone</em> for the release of their album, Samberg speaks to his youth in California where he was surrounded by “standard Bay Area hippie shit” (Gay). As their interest grew, music and musical creation became their dream: “Growing up, we never talked about ‘We should all work at Saturday Night Live!’ We were like, ‘Someday, we should make an album. That would be awesome.’” Jonathan Lethem describes this conversion through imitation as typical in his essay “The Ecstasy of Influence”: “Most artists are brought to their vocation when their own nascent gifts are awakened by the work of a master. That is to say, most artists are converted to art by art itself. Finding one’s voice isn’t just an emptying and purifying oneself of the words of others but an adopting and embracing of filiations, communities, and discourses” (3).\r\n\r\nChatman would have to agree because he sees parody as “at once ridicule and <em>homage</em>” (33). The Lonely Island’s respect for the art seems genuine; the <em>New York Times</em> hails another Lonely Island song, “Natalie Raps,” which is a blatant copy of Eazy-E’s song “No More ?’s,” by saying, “It isn’t parody; it is a love letter” (Caramancia). Yet the group blatantly ignores the authentic aspect of the genre, and in doing so, questions the authenticity of the original songs. When Akiva Shaffer was asked why they created an album, he answered “Suffice it to say, the streets wanted it,” referring to the neighborhood fascination and validation of much of gangsta rap. However, Samberg counters with the question, “Are you talking about the British rapper guy The Streets?” (Gay). Clearly, nothing is serious for the trio, which makes their songs funny, but hard to imagine as “authentic” parodies.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the answer lies in the idea that the Lonely Island isn’t actually making a parody, but a new form of rap. Rap may have begun as a way to bring the marginalization of black society to public attention, but with “Lazy Sunday,” the Lonely Island is reversing the flow, bringing public attention to the sterility of what is considered mainstream. They are able to accomplish this through “enframing,” philosopher Martin Heidegger’s idea, which encourages people to see the objects in their world “only in terms of how they can serve [them] or be used by [them]” (Lethem, 4). This is not foreign to traditional rap’s creation, as rap is a musical genre based on appropriations of other genres for the purpose of meeting the rapper’s needs. Parody does this, but in order to comment on the original form, not the new content. The Lonely Island combines the two to serve their own purpose that could be construed as a way to safely comment on their own culture while remaining safely behind the humor of the surface-level parody.\r\n\r\nEnframing does not apply just to art; it is a part of human nature. In many ways the diffusion of rap and hip hop into all facets of mainstream culture can be attributed to this phenomenon. “White youth are not simply consuming pop culture messages wholesale, any more than Black kids are,” writes Bakari Kitwana, a former executive editor of The Source, one of the first publications devoted to rap music, and author of Why White Kids Like Hip-Hop.  “Most hip-hop kids … are taking from popular culture what they find useful, fashioning it to local needs, claiming it as their own and in the process placing their own stamp on it” (3). “Lazy Sunday” may appear to be a parody in its imitation of rap; however, it is the lifestyle, not the method of expressing it, that is the parody. It is the gangsta bravado that is the inappropriate content, not the song describing it. The Lonely Island is not criticizing the embrace of rap by white audiences. Instead, their depiction seems to be more critical of the adoption of a false behavior due to the sterility of mainstream society.\r\n\r\nBy sticking too closely to the form of parody, is the Lonely Island at risk of completely hiding their message? Not according to rap, where parody can be worked into the genre and remain a valid component of that genre. 2 Live Crew, a group of “booty rappers” (rap focused on sex and eroticism), spawned controversy in the ’90s for both their explicit content and appropriation. They were sued for copyright violation for their parody of Roy Orbison’s 1964 hit, “Oh, Pretty Woman.” While a lower court found the group guilty, the Supreme Court found the song to be protected as an original parody under the doctrine of “fair use.” Justice David Souter explained that the song provided “social benefit … as a comment on the naiveté of the original of an earlier day, as a rejection of its sentiment that ignores the ugliness of street life and the debasement that it signifies” (Chatman, 27). Even outside of their parody, the “meaning hiding beneath the surface of the obvious meaning of the lyrics” in 2 Live Crew’s work has been considered beneficial social commentary. In a lawsuit over obscenity and pornography, witness Professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. concluded, “Well they represent the stereotype over and over again, in such a graphic way, namely to exploit it. You can have no reaction but to bust out laughing. You realize how ridiculous this all is” (Perkins, 25). While it is unlikely that 2 Live Crew originally wrote their works to be funny, or even to exploit stereotypes in a critical way, it is clear that their work is able to provide criticism, parody, and authenticity, thus successfully being rap while remaining humorous.\r\n\r\n“I think the goal of most comedy, just like most movies or television, is an escape from the mundane stuff in our life, and I’ve always found it worthwhile to make something completely stupid just to prove that you can,” said Andy Samberg in an online interview with <em>Esquire</em> about his work. His words highlight the dualism in his comedy—humor and criticism combined. When viewed within that context and not as parody, “Lazy Sunday” can offer the viewer more than a prescription for an amusing weekend agenda. It can offer a way to laugh at yourself, no matter your race, class, or musical tastes.

(226, 5, '2011-12-17 05:28:03', '2011-12-17 05:28:03', 'Walking into the exhibit “Material for a Film” by Emily Jacir, the first thing that meets the viewer’s eye is a repetitive panoply of bullet holes in the pages of a book. This larger-than-life book has nothing threatening about it; at first it leaves the viewer confused as to its purpose. One wanders further into the exhibit and notices more pictures of books, filling the wall. Some titles are in English and are recognizable: great classics, <em>Crime and Punishment</em>, <em>The Odyssey</em>. These were the books on Wael Zuaiter’s bookshelf the night he died. There are more pictures: a photograph of a coin Zuaiter used for the lift, a snapshot from a trip to Venice, pictures from dinner outings with his friends. There is even a film clip from his tiny role in <em>The Pink Panther</em>.  There are photos of the city he lived in, notes he wrote, and shots of his apartment. We see the exact rooms in which a man once lived. Accompanying the photographs are descriptions and anecdotes from Zuaiter’s life. Proceeding through the exhibit, one feels as if he or she is walking through someone’s life. The collection of photographs provides details that inspire curiosity. Exiting the exhibit, one notices a photograph so unobtrusive that it could have been overlooked upon entrance. It is a small black and white snapshot, inconspicuous next to the larger depictions of Zuaiter’s life. Entitled simply “Roma 16 ottobre 1972,” the photograph shows Zuaiter gunned down and bleeding in a building in Rome.\r\n\r\nThe exhibit, which won the Hugo Boss Prize for contemporary art, addresses the murder of Palestinian intellectual Wael Zuatier by Israeli secret service agents after the 1972 Munich Olympic attacks.  In retaliation for the Munich massacre, the Israeli government carried out assassinations of many Palestinians suspected in planning the attacks. One of the first Palestinians killed was translator Wael Zuatier, although he was never proven to have any ties with terrorists. Through “Material for a Film,” which can be seen as a mix of biography, politics and art, Jacir makes a more effective political point through narration than through the exploitation of violent images.\r\n\r\nThe appropriate presentation of violence in media and art is a topic that has been investigated thoroughly by many writers. One of the foremost scholars on the subject is Susan Sontag.  In her essay, “Looking at War,” Sontag casts doubts on the effectiveness of war photography in creating any kind of political change. She claims that basing assumptions on violent images “is to dismiss politics” (Sontag 83). Sontag believes that the context of any photograph is very important for its interpretation. Without context, a violent image becomes nothing more than a “spectacle” for people to enjoy (Sontag 94). She notes that “the appetite for pictures showing bodies in pain is almost as keen as the desire for ones that show bodies naked,” (Sontag 82) and calls those of us who view images of suffering but cannot alleviate that suffering “voyeurs” (Sontag 83). In her conclusion, Sontag writes: “Harrowing photographs do not inevitably lose their power to shock. But they don’t help us much to understand. Narratives can make us understand” (94).\r\nJacir’s exhibit deftly avoids the “spectacle” aspect of photography. Almost all of the photographs that Jacir puts on display are not shocking. A photograph of a book does not grab your attention the same way the Abu Ghraib torture photographs compel you to look. Jacir does not demand that her viewer look at the images. Moreover, she offers adequate context so that the violent situations can be understood. Her one image that could be described as “shocking”—the small black and white photograph—is deemphasized in the exhibition. Rather than shocking viewers, Jacir requests their attention. This gives viewers the luxury to peruse the exhibit as they please—without the feeling of horror associated with traumatic images.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, news companies often rely on the “shock-value” of their images in order to garner viewers’ attention. This negative phenomenon of exploitation is outlined by Arthur Kleinman and Joan Kleinman in their essay “The Appeal of Experience; The Dismay of Images: Cultural Appropriations of Suffering in Our Times.” Like Sontag, the authors analyze the moral dilemmas faced by professional photojournalists. Sontag observes that in order to make images more “shocking” and therefore commercial, photojournalists are often tempted to compromise the “moral authority” of their pictures (Sontag 92). She supports this idea with examples of many famous war photographs that were “posed.” In one Civil War photograph of Gettysburg, Sontag explains that the recently dead were moved “to a more photogenic site” to make the picture more dramatic (92). Kleinman and Kleinman observe this same phenomenon of moral exploitation as recently as 1994. In a famous Pulitzer Prize-winning photo by Kevin Carter, a starving girl is huddled on the ground in front of a vulture. While the photograph is very powerful in evoking a viewer response, Kleinman and Kleinman explain that the creation of the photograph raises ethical questions. Carter later revealed that he had waited “20 minutes, hoping the vulture would spread its wings,” before taking the photograph (Kleinman and Kleinman 5). This kind of inaction caused other journalists and Kleinman and Kleinman to question Carter’s morals. In their article, Kleinman and Kleinman wonder if he was “complicit” in the starvation when he took the time, “minutes that may have been critical at this point when she is near death, to compose an effective picture rather than save the child…” (Kleinman and Kleinman 5). However, the article acknowledges that the role of a professional photojournalist is to create images that “[provide] political testimony and [drive] people to act” (Kleinman and Kleinman 6). This gets at the crux of the dilemma faced by professional photojournalists. Commercially, photographs must exploit—ethically, they cannot. Kleinman and Kleinman note that the images that receive the most fame in the media are often those that depict the greatest horror.\r\n\r\nGiven the intense demand for images of suffering, it is interesting that Jacir has succeeded professionally without relying on photographs of violence. In contrast to Carter, Jacir did not need to involve herself in any sort of complicity when creating her images. Her approach to photography avoids the negative connotation of “exploitation” that results from violent imagery and her treatment of the material does not inspire the need for posing. Her photographs—of books, apartments, and letters—come across as honest representations of a man’s life. Instead of exploiting, Jacir uses the truthful material at hand to create her work.\r\nNonetheless, Jacir does not fail to make her political purpose clear. Kleinman and Kleinman define inspiring political change as the intended purpose of violent images. Sontag also believes that images are political, but violent images should only be observed by those with the power to create change. With the images in “Material for a Film,” Jacir wishes to create sympathy for a murder victim in a topical war. Her exhibit lends support to the Palestinian plight in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. More than this, it outlines a problem that this and all wars create: the death of innocent intellectuals. However, her art is more moving than reading an article about Zuaiter’s life, or watching a film. Her format inspires interaction and connection with the narrative. One can walk through the exhibit without being overwhelmed with horror. It does not cause sensory overload and the violence is contextualized. Instead of a nameless victim, bloodied on the streets—you can barely see Zuaiter’s face in the picture—we know who this man is and his role in world politics. The viewer fully understands the tragic loss of an intellectual mind because of the Israel-Palestinian conflict.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the voyeuristic and exploitative problems associated with violent photographs, Sontag proposes that too much exposure to violent imagery can be “desensitizing” (Sontag 97). Flooded with shocking images, Sontag argues that “we are losing our capacity to react” (Sontag 97). Kleinman and Kleinman further note the highly disturbing problem of how the media often unintentionally perpetuates the horrors they are trying to prevent. They cite the example of a news article using a picture of a child prostitute that “appeals…to a prurient sensibility” (Kleinman and Kleinman 11). In making this photograph marketable, the media is appealing to the same love of violence and sexuality that caused the photograph to be made.\r\n\r\nJacir goes out of her way to contextualize the violence she presents. With only one violent image, Jacir does not desensitize her viewer, nor does she perpetuate the violence she is condemning. By not relying on shock value and by accompanying her violent image with others that offer insight into the situation, Jacir inspires sympathy and understanding—until one does condemn the violence that is presented. Though Sontag might cite all the problems associated with violent imagery as reasons to discredit the use of violent photography, Kleinman and Kleinman are quick to point out that this does not imply that the documentation of violence should be avoided. They write that “the possibility of moral appeal through images of human misery,” means that their absence causes “existential dismay” (Kleinman and Kleinman 16). To them, there is a fine line between documentation and exploitation. There should be no doubt that violent images are necessary in our society. These images show the ugly truth of things we might not wish to contemplate.  The fact that violence exists should not be suppressed, but such imagery should not be used as pornography for the masses. Citizens should neither be encouraged nor forced to look at images that are nothing more than a series of horrors with little context. Jacir’s model walks this line admirably.\r\n\r\nWhile not relying on the seduction of violent imagery, Jacir’s exhibit is nevertheless very successful in conveying its political message. The effectiveness of Jacir’s exhibit can be seen as a result of its narrative form. Just as Sontag predicts that “a narrative seems more likely to be effective than an image” (98), Jacir’s narrative is more effective than any multitude of violent images. In contemporary representations of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, viewers are often presented with scenes of soldiers marching through towns, or the aftermath of a suicide bombing. Instead of brief, shocking images, Jacir gives us deeper understanding of the results of such conflict.  What is inspiring is that the exhibit contradicts Sontag’s argument that “No photograph, or portfolio of photographs” (Sontag 98) can go further than a moving film about the horrors of war. Though Sontag believes that photographs cannot create understanding, the main medium of Jacir’s exhibit is photography. And her photographs do create empathy.\r\n\r\nThe conductors of the experiment “Chinese Village Women as Visual Anthropologists: A Participatory Approach to Reaching Policymakers” would not be surprised at the ability of photographs to convey narrative meaning. Caroline Wang, Mary Ann Burris, and Xiang Yue Ping demonstrates the power of the photo “novella” form within politics. Their anthropological experiment gave rural Chinese women cameras in order to document the women’s health issues and spur change in a male- dominated society. The format of the “photo novella” in this experiment was chosen because “The essence of photo novella is to avoid the voyeuristic quality that often characterizes professional photojournalists’ work” (Wang 1393).  When the photos went on public display, the experimenters noticed that common people, officials, and the media were all interested in viewing the work.  They wrote: “The ‘human interest’ strength of photo novella fires the attention of the media, too, as demonstrated by the attendance of national and local press at the Chengjiang County opening” (Wang 1394). Their novella format aroused interest and curiosity within the larger population, especially because it dealt with daily life. As a result of the photographs, policy changes were enacted in the village to provide more health care for women and better daycare services. Like the experiment, Jacir uses a type of novella to “put a human face on the data” (Wang 1395). Her photographs become narratives as they take us through Zuaiter’s day-to-day life.  Their human qualities draw the viewer in and allow him or her to better connect to the information being presented.\r\n\r\nThe mainstream media, so often plagued with the problems inherent in violent imagery, could perhaps benefit from looking at Jacir’s model of presentation. To sell, the media does not always need to shock us. It does not need to perpetuate the brief looks at violence that result in voyeurism instead of effecting change. Instead, the media needs to do as thorough a job as Jacir has done with her work. Finding personal stories and presenting the spectrum of lives of others is a more lasting means of communication. While the creation of violent imagery should not be suppressed and nothing should prevent documentation, we must remember the reason for this imagery in the first place. To prevent violence, and to make political change, violent imagery should give us a profound and comprehensive understanding of world events.\r\n\r\nIn the caption to photographs of the pages of the bullet-ridden book, we learn that this was Zuaiter’s copy of <em>One Thousand and One Arabian Nights</em>. Zuaiter, who was fluent in English, Arabic, Italian and French, wished to translate this book from Arabic to Italian. He was working on the project when he was assassinated. One of the bullets lodged into the spine of the book that he was carrying that night. To this day, a direct translation from Arabic to Italian of <em>One Thousand and One Arabian Nights</em> does not exist. No violent photograph could depict intelligence gunned down as effectively as a simple picture of a bullet in a book.', 'Emily Jacir: A Model to Effect Positive Change through Photography', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'emily-jacir-a-model-to-effect-positive-change-through-photography', '', '', '2012-03-23 15:12:18', '2012-03-23 15:12:18', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=226', 0, 'essay', '', 0),
(227, 8, '2012-03-01 15:53:17', '2012-03-01 15:53:17', 'Walking into the exhibit “Material for a Film” by Emily Jacir, the first thing that meets the viewer’s eye is a repetitive panoply of bullet holes in the pages of a book. This larger-than-life book has nothing threatening about it; at first it leaves the viewer confused as to its purpose. One wanders further into the exhibit and notices more pictures of books, filling the wall. Some titles are in English and are recognizable: great classics, <em>Crime and Punishment</em>, <em>The Odyssey</em>. These were the books on Wael Zuaiter’s bookshelf the night he died. There are more pictures: a photograph of a coin Zuaiter used for the lift, a snapshot from a trip to Venice, pictures from dinner outings with his friends. There is even a film clip from his tiny role in <em>The Pink Panther</em>.  There are photos of the city he lived in, notes he wrote, and shots of his apartment. We see the exact rooms in which a man once lived. Accompanying the photographs are descriptions and anecdotes from Zuaiter’s life. Proceeding through the exhibit, one feels as if he or she is walking through someone’s life. The collection of photographs provides details that inspire curiosity. Exiting the exhibit, one notices a photograph so unobtrusive that it could have been overlooked upon entrance. It is a small black and white snapshot, inconspicuous next to the larger depictions of Zuaiter’s life. Entitled simply “Roma 16 ottobre 1972,” the photograph shows Zuaiter gunned down and bleeding in a building in Rome.\r\n\r\nThe exhibit, which won the Hugo Boss Prize for contemporary art, addresses the murder of Palestinian intellectual Wael Zuatier by Israeli secret service agents after the 1972 Munich Olympic attacks.  In retaliation for the Munich massacre, the Israeli government carried out assassinations of many Palestinians suspected in planning the attacks. One of the first Palestinians killed was translator Wael Zuatier, although he was never proven to have any ties with terrorists. Through “Material for a Film,” which can be seen as a mix of biography, politics and art, Jacir makes a more effective political point through narration than through the exploitation of violent images.\r\n\r\nThe appropriate presentation of violence in media and art is a topic that has been investigated thoroughly by many writers. One of the foremost scholars on the subject is Susan Sontag.  In her essay, “Looking at War,” Sontag casts doubts on the effectiveness of war photography in creating any kind of political change. She claims that basing assumptions on violent images “is to dismiss politics” (Sontag 83). Sontag believes that the context of any photograph is very important for its interpretation. Without context, a violent image becomes nothing more than a “spectacle” for people to enjoy (Sontag 94). She notes that “the appetite for pictures showing bodies in pain is almost as keen as the desire for ones that show bodies naked,” (Sontag 82) and calls those of us who view images of suffering but cannot alleviate that suffering “voyeurs” (Sontag 83). In her conclusion, Sontag writes: “Harrowing photographs do not inevitably lose their power to shock. But they don’t help us much to understand. Narratives can make us understand” (94).\r\nJacir’s exhibit deftly avoids the “spectacle” aspect of photography. Almost all of the photographs that Jacir puts on display are not shocking. A photograph of a book does not grab your attention the same way the Abu Ghraib torture photographs compel you to look. Jacir does not demand that her viewer look at the images. Moreover, she offers adequate context so that the violent situations can be understood. Her one image that could be described as “shocking”—the small black and white photograph—is deemphasized in the exhibition. Rather than shocking viewers, Jacir requests their attention. This gives viewers the luxury to peruse the exhibit as they please—without the feeling of horror associated with traumatic images.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, news companies often rely on the “shock-value” of their images in order to garner viewers’ attention. This negative phenomenon of exploitation is outlined by Arthur Kleinman and Joan Kleinman in their essay “The Appeal of Experience; The Dismay of Images: Cultural Appropriations of Suffering in Our Times.” Like Sontag, the authors analyze the moral dilemmas faced by professional photojournalists. Sontag observes that in order to make images more “shocking” and therefore commercial, photojournalists are often tempted to compromise the “moral authority” of their pictures (Sontag 92). She supports this idea with examples of many famous war photographs that were “posed.” In one Civil War photograph of Gettysburg, Sontag explains that the recently dead were moved “to a more photogenic site” to make the picture more dramatic (92). Kleinman and Kleinman observe this same phenomenon of moral exploitation as recently as 1994. In a famous Pulitzer Prize-winning photo by Kevin Carter, a starving girl is huddled on the ground in front of a vulture. While the photograph is very powerful in evoking a viewer response, Kleinman and Kleinman explain that the creation of the photograph raises ethical questions. Carter later revealed that he had waited “20 minutes, hoping the vulture would spread its wings,” before taking the photograph (Kleinman and Kleinman 5). This kind of inaction caused other journalists and Kleinman and Kleinman to question Carter’s morals. In their article, Kleinman and Kleinman wonder if he was “complicit” in the starvation when he took the time, “minutes that may have been critical at this point when she is near death, to compose an effective picture rather than save the child…” (Kleinman and Kleinman 5). However, the article acknowledges that the role of a professional photojournalist is to create images that “[provide] political testimony and [drive] people to act” (Kleinman and Kleinman 6). This gets at the crux of the dilemma faced by professional photojournalists. Commercially, photographs must exploit—ethically, they cannot. Kleinman and Kleinman note that the images that receive the most fame in the media are often those that depict the greatest horror.\r\n\r\nGiven the intense demand for images of suffering, it is interesting that Jacir has succeeded professionally without relying on photographs of violence. In contrast to Carter, Jacir did not need to involve herself in any sort of complicity when creating her images. Her approach to photography avoids the negative connotation of “exploitation” that results from violent imagery and her treatment of the material does not inspire the need for posing. Her photographs—of books, apartments, and letters—come across as honest representations of a man’s life. Instead of exploiting, Jacir uses the truthful material at hand to create her work.\r\nNonetheless, Jacir does not fail to make her political purpose clear. Kleinman and Kleinman define inspiring political change as the intended purpose of violent images. Sontag also believes that images are political, but violent images should only be observed by those with the power to create change. With the images in “Material for a Film,” Jacir wishes to create sympathy for a murder victim in a topical war. Her exhibit lends support to the Palestinian plight in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. More than this, it outlines a problem that this and all wars create: the death of innocent intellectuals. However, her art is more moving than reading an article about Zuaiter’s life, or watching a film. Her format inspires interaction and connection with the narrative. One can walk through the exhibit without being overwhelmed with horror. It does not cause sensory overload and the violence is contextualized. Instead of a nameless victim, bloodied on the streets—you can barely see Zuaiter’s face in the picture—we know who this man is and his role in world politics. The viewer fully understands the tragic loss of an intellectual mind because of the Israel-Palestinian conflict.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the voyeuristic and exploitative problems associated with violent photographs, Sontag proposes that too much exposure to violent imagery can be “desensitizing” (Sontag 97). Flooded with shocking images, Sontag argues that “we are losing our capacity to react” (Sontag 97). Kleinman and Kleinman further note the highly disturbing problem of how the media often unintentionally perpetuates the horrors they are trying to prevent. They cite the example of a news article using a picture of a child prostitute that “appeals…to a prurient sensibility” (Kleinman and Kleinman 11). In making this photograph marketable, the media is appealing to the same love of violence and sexuality that caused the photograph to be made.\r\n\r\nJacir goes out of her way to contextualize the violence she presents. With only one violent image, Jacir does not desensitize her viewer, nor does she perpetuate the violence she is condemning. By not relying on shock value and by accompanying her violent image with others that offer insight into the situation, Jacir inspires sympathy and understanding—until one does condemn the violence that is presented.

(403, 8, '2012-03-23 15:13:28', '2012-03-23 15:13:28', 'Accelerating globalization over the last half century has granted developing countries steadily increasing access to the medicines and healthcare practices of the first world. As the market for medications has expanded, however, so too has the pool of prospective subjects for clinical trials—and pharmaceutical researchers have leapt to take advantage of them (Glickman 816). The resulting surge in human-subject trials taking place in developing countries (especially those of Eastern Europe and Africa) has generated considerable concern among ethicists, medical professionals, and social commentators. They warn of the potential of first-world medical researchers to exploit the rights of vulnerable participants given the wide disparities that exist in education and healthcare between these countries and those of the developed world (Killen et al. 214). In particular, controversy has centered on the ethics of using a placebo control-group in which one group of participants receives a placebo (pharmaceutically inert substance) for their illness despite the existence of a medication shown to be therapeutically successful (Lau 192). In other words, researchers deny a group of subjects access to the best known treatment. Recent revisions to the Declaration of Helsinki, published by the World Medical Association and widely regarded as the governing document for research involving human subjects (Angell, "Ethics of Clinical Research" 847), have fueled a debate (that is poorly publicized outside of the medical community) on the role of the placebo in clinical trials in developing countries.\n\nIn this debate, as in all debates of medical ethics, we lay people have what Robert M. Veatch, Professor of Medical Ethics at Georgetown University, describes as a "critical role." It is we who must select and revise "an ethical theory and other components of an evaluative framework" (4) to apply to clinical research. By examining some of the complex issues involved in discussions of globalized clinical trials, we can develop an informed perspective on which to base such important decisions. This essay first outlines the main issues in this particular debate (the use of the placebo, and the concept of the standard of care), and then focuses on one series of clinical trials in particular, which will enable us to draw out the main ethical conflicts around which the debate centers. In that critical role of the lay person, I ultimately argue that placebo use is unethical when alternative trial methods exist that do not breach a harmonized code of ethics for international clinical research.\n\nThe placebo, a pharmaceutically inert substance (typically a sugar pill), is the clinical researcher''s analogue to the scientist''s control experiment. To prove a new treatment effective above and beyond the psychological results of a simple belief in the drug''s ability to cure, a researcher will compare the experimental treatment''s results for an illness with those obtained from the placebo. The placebo-controlled trial "is widely regarded as the gold standard for testing the efficacy of new treatments" (Miller 707) and its use is based on the ethical concept of <em>equipoise</em>. Equipoise is "a genuine state of uncertainty about which of the two treatments of a clinical trial has a better efficacy" (Lau 194), and is considered a necessary condition if a clinical trial will use placebos. When there is no known effective treatment, a new drug might produce better, worse, or the same results as no treatment (the placebo) and so there is no ethical conflict in trials where this equipoise is present. If, on the other hand, a therapeutic treatment already exists, then equipoise is no longer present and the trial becomes subject to conflicting ethical standpoints. Whilst "regulatory standards and codes of ethics differ in their guidance concerning placebo-controlled trials when standard, effective treatments exist" (Miller 708), the current (2008) revision of the Declaration of Helsinki states in Provision 32 that "effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested against those of the best current proven intervention" (World Medical Association 2008).\n\nThe Declaration of Helsinki argues that all research participants should be entitled to a "standard of care," a term which the medical community borrows from tort law, and is defined as the "degree of attentiveness, caution, and prudence that a reasonable person in the circumstances would exercise" (USLegal). In medical practice, achieving the standard of care has come to mean that physicians must prescribe their patients the best available treatment in fulfilling their obligation to provide the best possible care for that patients. As new drugs are proven more effective for any given illness, the standard of care for that illness increases accordingly. When physicians acting as clinical researchers fail to offer the standard of care by offering a placebo instead, they break their commitment to their patients by denying them the right to proven treatment (Miller 709); in deceiving them about what their treatment actually is (or rather, isn''t) they fail to uphold their patients'' right to be fully informed.\n\nAn example of research that has highlighted the ethical tension between the use of the placebo and the standard of care is the series of clinical trials that took place in Africa, predominantly in the later 1990s, that examined interventions designed to prevent perinatal (mother-child) transmission of HIV. These trials occurred after the landmark 1994 publication of the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) Study 076, a randomized, controlled trial that showed that the antiretroviral drug zidovudine "reduced mother-to-infant transmission [of HIV] by approximately two-thirds, with minimal short-term toxic effects" (National Institutes for Health). In developed countries, the zidovudine treatment thus became (and remains today) the minimum standard of care for HIV-positive pregnant women (Buckley 250). Crucially, however, the potential of the drug in developing countries and especially in sub-Saharan Africa remains unrealized "primarily because of the drug''s exorbitant cost" (Laurie 853). The controversial trials, involving over 17,000 women, were all attempting to develop an equally efficient and yet cheaper substitute for zidovudine, so that a more universally available treatment might be found. It is not the worthiness of this goal, but rather the method by which these trials determined the relative efficacy of different treatments that has stimulated debate: as placebo-controlled trials, they necessarily incorporated control groups of mothers deliberately given no effective treatment <em>despite the existence of therapeutically proven treatment</em>.\n\nAlthough it may be true that these women would not have received any treatment had they not been involved in the trial, it is equally true that "investigators assume broad responsibility for the welfare of the subjects they enroll in their studies" (Angell, "Investigators'' Responsibilities" 969) and, from a lay person''s perspective, the apparent disregard on the part of the researchers for the best interests of <em>all</em> their human subjects seems unethical. Investigators, however, have upheld the view that research in developing countries should be held to different standards from those which govern research in the developed world. In defending their research, their arguments necessarily center around the problem for which a universal notion of the standard of care presents. Many have asserted that investigators have no obligation to provide better care for human subjects than that which "is generally available in the community from which the subjects are drawn" (Angell, "Investigators'' Responsibilities" 967). This distinction, given that "hospital and clinic infrastructure, treatment choices, and quality of care vary widely from country to country" (Glickman 819) implies that the standard of care is different in every country and legitimizes placebo-controlled trials in developing countries on the grounds that the standard of care in these countries is typically no better than a placebo. In support of this view, Dr. Nicholas Meda, an epidemiologist from Burkina Faso, stated at a conference of European medical ethicists in 2002 that "in communities where there is no access to treatment of any sort, the concept of best available treatment (as defined by rich countries) is meaningless" (Richards 796).\n\nThis idea of a varying standard of care is further justified when one takes into account not only the different availability of treatment in the developing world, but also the vastly different interests these regions have in ongoing clinical research. Thus it is argued that "health research in poor countries should be designed and conducted pragmatically, taking into account local health needs and priorities" (Richards 796). This argument follows the same logic as the World Health Organization panel that approved the controversial zidovudine trials, stating "placebo-controlled trials offer the best option for a rapid and scientifically valid assessment of alternative antiretroviral drug regimens" (World Health Organization), and emphasizing the need for a rapid solution for the HIV epidemic. Strict interpretation of the Declaration of Helsinki could potentially make research too expensive to carry out, and thus stifle efforts to improve treatment options for devastating illnesses such as HIV/AIDS or tuberculosis. In the broader interest of society, therefore, placebo control groups are ethically acceptable, particularly given the huge potential benefits that research may bring for the developing world.\n\nWhat these rationalizations reveal, as doctors Peter Lurie and Sidney Wolfe of the Public Citizen''s Health Research Group (a political lobby group based in Washington) have pointed out, is a "fundamental misunderstanding of the concept of the standard of care" (Lurie 854). The concept of a standard of care is based on the most advanced medicine available to benefit humanity, not on the economic ability or inability of those in developing countries to afford the prices set by drug manufacturers. If the standard of care is accepted to vary between the developed and the developing world, or between one country and another, then why should they not also vary within a country or even a single city? The acceptance of an inconsistent standard of care inevitably leads to inconsistent standards for research. As the regulatory environment surrounding the use of human subjects in clinical trials becomes increasingly bureaucratic and expensive (Glickman 817), the incentive to use as research subjects those with the least access to health care increases. Just as weak labor laws encourage a "race to the bottom" by prompting firms to seek to outsource production to countries with the lowest wages, weak ethical oversight of clinical trials lead to a "race to the bottom" by rewarding drug companies for exploiting human subjects in developing countries with cheap research. What follows is that "the abominable state of health care in [developing] countries can be used to justify studies that could never pass ethical muster" in the developed world (Lurie 855).\n\nHere, the perspective of the lay person―independent of any particular vested interest in medical research―becomes vitally important. The most pressing issue should not be one of medical technicality, but one of Veatch''s "ethical frameworks": how valuable does the lay person find an irreducible ethical code for clinical research, and how strongly does the lay person believe in a universal standard of care? If we apply a standard of ethics that is based on the economic circumstances of a region, then we might accept that those in a poor neighborhood are less entitled to treatment than those in a richer neighborhood. An ethical framework that rejects this relativism must also uphold a universal standard of care. Indeed, one of the primary reasons why ethical codes for medicine (such as that which requires physicians to treat their patients to the best of their ability) place such a strong emphasis on the universality of their application is to combat the temptation for medical researchers to subordinate their subjects'' welfare to that of medical progress. With the most altruistic of intentions (e.g. reducing the expense of HIV/AIDS medication), researchers might "find themselves slipping across a line that prohibits treating human subjects as a means to an end" (Angell, "Ethics of Clinical Research" 847).\n\nYet one could ask why the use of human subjects as a means to an end is ethically prohibited. Who gets to defines the boundaries of what is (and is not) ethical for clinical research on humans? Currently, ethicists of the developed world in organizations such as the WHO and the WMA have the most influence, leading at least one, Dr. Ruth Macklin, a professor of bioethics at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, to use the term "ethical imperialism" (188) to criticize developed countries for imposing their ethical frameworks on developing nations. Whilst first-world nations might be justified in setting guidelines for trials and scientists in their own "developed" world, research originating in, and carried out by, scientists from Africa, Latin America, of Eastern Europe should be guided by the universal "principle of justice that says: ''Treat like cases alike and different cases differently''" (210).\n\nThe idea here is that those working in the developing world should have greater flexibility to define ethical frameworks relative to their own cultural and healthcare needs. The problem with this method, a problem which undermines the framework insisting on a universal standard of care, is in distinguishing how two cases are alike or different. Proponents of the zidovudine trials believed that they were different from similar trials in developed countries because they were founded on inherently different risk-benefit opportunities (i.e. the potential to stem an epidemic such as HIV) and cultural motives on behalf of the researchers. Opponents believed that regardless of who was carrying out the research, the trials were like any other trial involving human subjects and thus governed by the Declaration of Helsinki''s ethical requirements. Ultimately, we must recognize that "to get beyond relativism is not to embrace ethical imperialism" (Macklin 273). Upholding the sanctity of the human being, as acknowledged in the ethical and medical precepts of the developed world and embodied in the concept of a universal standard of care, means that research should accommodate the cultural and healthcare needs of the developing world.\n\nFinally, those who attempt to skirt around the fundamental ethical quandary of placebo-controlled trials by suggesting that the greater responsibility of researchers is not for their individual human subjects but for the greater needs of society ignore the existence of viable alternatives. Research need not be stifled simply because placebo-controlled groups are deemed unethical in cases where effective treatment exists. Indeed, from a scientific perspective, active-controlled trials (in which a new medication is compared to the existing standard of care)―provided that reasonable doubt exists amongst researchers as to the relative efficacy of the two drugs―avoid the ethical problems of a placebo and enable research that meets the requirements of equipoise. As zidovudine and other drugs with high retail value are "usually made available free of charge by the manufacturer for use in clinical trials" (Lurie and Wolfe 854), excessive cost is not a compelling objection. Active-controlled trials therefore have the advantage of being both ethically acceptable and, for the multi-billion dollar pharmaceutical industry in which each of the largest twenty companies alone invested over one billion dollars into research in 2007 (Med Ad), economically feasible. Furthermore, there is a growing consensus within the sphere of clinical research that active-controlled trials are "scientifically preferable" (Weijer 306) to placebo-controlled studies. Instead of seeking to determine whether the experimental treatment is "better than nothing," clinical trials should test whether it is superior to or equivalent in efficacy to standard treatment which already has been proven effective (Rothman and Michels 849).\n\nThe active-controlled trial emerges as a solution compatible with both the need for trials with massive potential benefits for society to be carried out in developing countries, and the ethical framework that we as lay persons must impose on medical research wherever that research might take place. Ultimately the greatest problem is summed up by Dr. Peter Piot, former Executive Director of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, in a letter to the editor of the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>: "The real double standard lies not in the way trials are being conducted, but in the inequity in access to medicines in different countries." Whilst there is little lay persons can do to solve that particular issue in the immediate future, a continued discussion about implementation and enforcement of an appropriate ethical framework governing clinical trials in developing countries lies entirely within our grasp.', 'Ethics of Placebo-Controlled Trials in Developing Countries: The Search for Standards and Solutions', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '203-autosave', '', '', '2012-03-23 15:13:28', '2012-03-23 15:13:28', '', 203, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?p=403', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Perhaps most intriguing, though, is W.H. Auden, who sought not only to publish his poems but to control them. Toward the end of his life, Auden constantly reconsidered his poems in an attempt to impose order and decide for himself which pieces would appear in his ultimate canon. While working on his <em>Collected Poems</em>later in life, Auden radically rewrote and even threw away some of his best known poems, arguing that they were boring and dishonest. As a highly intellectual and methodical poet, Auden clearly thought through each of these exclusions, even revealing his rationale, yet this thought process cannot defuse the controversy of removing published work from the public sphere.\r\n\r\nIn his early years as a poet, Auden experimented with different political stances and poetic styles—something expected of developing writers. He later revolted against these political agendas, however, attempting to erase such poems from his past and, therefore, his future legacy. According to Auden’s hand-picked literary executor, Edward Mendelson, in his essay “Revision and Power: The Example of W. H. Auden,” Auden deemed these poems deeply revolting and revised an estimated three quarters of his canon. The current events and the needs of the political climate in which he wrote clearly influenced Auden, but he later expressed anxiety that such politically infused poems did not represent his own voice.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Auden theorized that the skills required to craft works of art are the same skills that pose danger in politics, leading to campaigns for beautification and sterilization. Thus, Auden felt compelled to revise his political poetry. In “Squares and Oblongs,” his essay on revisionism, Auden writes that the “Orpheus who moved stones is the archetype, not of the poet, but of Goebbels,” and poets should refrain from exercising control over their readers (180). This explains why he refused to include “Spain” and “September 1, 1939,” two of his most famous poems, in his 1965 publication, <em>Collected Shorter Poems 192</em><em>7–1957. </em>According to Mendelson in his aforementioned essay, Auden “did not drop these poems because he disagreed with their politics… but because he distrusted their power to convince his readers that he and they were on the right side in the great struggles of the age” (105). He did not want his poems to be “deceptive” or “flattering” and thus refused to include “September 1, 1939” precisely because he refused to leave open the possibility that his poems would be misused as propaganda (106). Thus, he preferred to destroy some of his most highly regarded poems rather than leave them to misinterpretation.\r\n\r\nThis problem of misinterpretation and misuse becomes especially interesting in light of the critical theories of Roland Barthes. In the 1960s and 70s, literary criticism underwent a radical transformation; until then, writing had been viewed as the output of a definite author, who shaped the text with his personal experiences and theories; however, this perspective disappeared with the so-called “Death of the Author,” Barthes’ essay on how the reader’s interpretation of a text matters most. In order to establish this reader, however, Barthes proclaims that the author must die and explains that society should not aggrandize the importance of the author because “To give a text an Author is to impose a limit on that text, to furnish it with a final signified [meaning], to close the writing” (147). In Barthes’ theories, the author and the work come into being together, and the author does not impose any secret meaning or intent on his text; rather, all meaning lies within the text itself, and “The reader is the space on which all the quotations that make up a writing are inscribed without any of them being lost; a text’s unity lies not in its origin but in its destination” (148). Barthes might argue that Auden’s wishes should stay disconnected from his poetry, and that the ultimate meaning of poems like “September 1, 1939” should be derived from their own content. The reader, whose birth Barthes calls for, presents his own troubles, however, since he too may impose questionable theories on the text.\r\n\r\nBarthes seems to argue that a text stands alone, rendering all interpretations valid, yet anyone who has been through a high school English class knows that this cannot possibly be true. For instance, after reading Nathaniel Hawthorne’s <em>The Scarlet Letter,</em> a student could argue that Dimmesdale really loves Hester’s daughter, Pearl, or that the scarlet letter itself is a gang sign, or any other number of absurdities. The student could probably even find a few quotations that, taken out of context, support his ridiculous theory. Ultimately, though, any astute reader knows that these interpretations are not and cannot ever be valid. While Auden probably was not thinking about misinterpretations of <em>The Scarlet Letter, </em>his fears followed a similar pattern. He refused to include “September 1, 1939” because he feared that politicians would misinterpret it as glorifying their personal goals and use it for propaganda. In fact, as Mendelson notes, President Lyndon B. Johnson used the poem in a 1964 campaign speech, and, in the 1980s, President George H.W. Bush adapted a few lines to one of his “most deceptive speeches” (110). Thus, with the death of the author, Barthes forgets that there remains the equally frustrating problem of the birth of the reader. Without a definite author who can reshape his work, misuse and misinterpretation become an imminent threat.\r\n\r\nYet, poetry is not a commodity to be owned, and, thus, author and owner can never exist together either. According to Barthes, the idea of the author and of writing as ownership emerged after the humanist movement of the Renaissance, yet Barthes urges critics to abandon these notions and view writing as an event that takes place in a “negative where all identity is lost” (142), so that it does not matter who specifically is speaking. Since a definite distance emerges between text and writer, readers need not seek a final, attempted theme or goal in a work.\r\n\r\nIn his 1970 essay “What Is an Author?,” Michel Foucault responds to Barthes’ theories and poses his own questions about the idea of the author. Foucault challenges Barthes: “It is not enough, however, to repeat the empty affirmation that the author has disappeared” (105). He demonstrates the importance of the author’s name, which changes in accordance with his work; to explain this, Foucault argues that Shakespeare’s name would take on completely different connotations if historians discovered that he wrote Bacon’s scientific works in addition to his plays and poems. Foucault elaborates, “The author function is therefore characteristic of the mode of existence, circulation, and functioning of certain discourses within a society” (108). Thus, the public’s conception of an author depends on the writings of his that they read. Foucault then addresses the difficulty in defining an author’s “work.” Barthes calls for the death of the author in order to transfer all meaning to the work itself, but Foucault complicates the issue, wondering how to define an author’s “work” and asking “What if, within a workbook filled with aphorisms, one finds a reference, the notation of a meeting or of an address, or a laundry list: Is it a work, or not… How can one define a work amid the millions of traces left by someone after his death?” (103-4). This raises fascinating concerns about Auden’s canon, since, even though he has been dead for thirty-six years, no <em>Complete Poems </em>exists—only Auden’s personally arranged<em>Collected Poems </em>and the more recent <em>Selected Poems</em>.\r\n\r\nIn the new <em>Selected Poems</em>—released for Auden’s would-be centennial last year—Mendelson included many of the poems that Auden tried to erase. Mendelson has also edited Auden’s <em>Collected Poems, </em>the controversial publication from which Auden excluded “Spain” and “September 1, 1939.” In his introduction to <em>Selected Poems, </em>Mendelson explains:\r\n\r\nThe present selection ... [reprints] the texts of Auden’s early editions and [includes] poems that he later rejected. A historical edition of this kind, one that reflects the author’s work as it first appeared in public rather than his final version of it, is not intended as an argument that Auden’s revisions or rejections were arbitrary or misguided; he had strong literary and ethical motives for choosing them. (xv)\r\n\r\nThus, it seems that Auden failed in his quest to permanently reshape his body of work. Currently, his fans and readers may understand his wishes to erase, but they will probably read “September 1, 1939” and “Spain” regardless. If Auden’s very name and reputation depend on the extent of his work, then he would seem to deserve the power that he tries to exert over his poetry. Foucault might argue that “Since literary anonymity is not tolerable,” Barthes’ ideas on the tyranny of the author are invalid, and Auden should be able to claim his own work (109). Foucault seems to support this notion when he includes St. Jerome’s criteria for imposing unity on a number of different works; however, Foucault ultimately concludes his essay by asking “What difference does it make who is speaking?” (120). But if it does not matter who is speaking, it certainly matters that someone is speaking and, consequently, poetry requires a blend between the critical theories of Barthes and Foucault. As Barthes observes, the author should remain distanced from the work, but, as in Foucault, instead of dying completely, the author should remain as a “function.” As the coldness of the term suggests, however, the author function should not rely on any personal or autobiographical characteristics of the author; rather, it should depend on the complex division between author and text. Thus, Auden’s motivations become irrelevant, but his insistence on revision serves to deepen the tension between crafter and craft. Perhaps William Butler Yeats, an important influence on Auden’s work, best captures this relationship when he asks, “How can we know the dancer from the dance?” (“Among School Children,” line 64).\r\n\r\nPoet and poems clearly remain divided somehow, though. Whereas Auden’s<em>Collected Poems </em>appeared exactly as he wished during his lifetime, the current status of his canon rests in the hands of his literary executor, who has restored some of Auden’s prized poems now that he is dead. Yet, this raises the question of completeness, because exclusion seems to suggest a body of work that has not yet obtained its final shape. One must wonder which is the more complete: Auden’s certified <em>Collected Poems </em>or the newly expanded <em>Selected Poems. </em>This distinction re-engages Barthes and Foucault, because Auden’s revisionism surpassed the simple editing of words and line breaks and drastically altered the presentation of his theories to the world.\r\n\r\nBarthes and Foucault address the question of whether the text exists as a separate entity from its author and, if so, whether Auden’s re-ordering and discarding constitute valid processes. In “What Is an Author?,” Foucault challenges the notion of possession, questioning the distinction between author and owner. In this essay, Foucault also details that “Once a system of ownership for texts came into being… the possibility of transgression attached to the act of writing took on, more and more, the form of an imperative peculiar to literature… thereby restoring danger to a writing which now guaranteed the benefits of ownership” (108-9). As Foucault suggests, the sole ownership of a piece of writing by its writer poses a danger; in Auden’s case this danger is evident in the suppression of key poems. If Auden owns his poems, then he possesses the ability to decide when his canon is complete—or, more accurately, what constitutes his complete canon. Adding another level to the question of ownership, however, Barthes cites Mallarmé, who, he claims, foresaw “the necessity to substitute language itself for the person who until then had been supposed to be its owner” (143). Thus, Barthes might argue that the poems themselves stand alone, and their language fulfills their purpose, which Auden does not own and cannot alter.\r\nAuden tried to change the intent—or possible uses—of poems such as “September 1, 1939” when he tried to radically change his canon by removing already-published poems from the public sphere. Barthes and Foucault address this idea of text existing in a space as well. In “The Death of the Author,” Barthes explains that “Writing is that neutral, composite, oblique space where our subject slips away, the negative of all identity is lost” (142). For Barthes, the stanza is a room where the door is locked, and as soon as writing begins, a disconnect emerges between poet and poem. Although Barthes only speaks of an individual reader, this disconnect would logically increase when a text enters the public sphere (<em>id est</em>,through publication). Once a poem has reached the public, can it be retracted? It certainly cannot be forgotten. In his introduction to Auden’s <em>Selected Poems,</em>Mendelson himself suggests a duality:\r\n\r\nProbably the best way to experience Auden’s work is to read the early versions first for their greater immediate impact, and the revised versions afterward for their greater subtlety and depth. For most readers this book [<em>Selected Poems</em>] will be a First Auden, and the edition of his “Collected Poems” that was published posthumously according to his final intentions may be recommended as a Second. (xv)\r\n\r\nEven though the <em>Collected </em>appeared far earlier than the <em>Selected, </em>Mendelson labels it “a Second.” This would seem to suggest that Auden becomes two authors: the poet who produced the political works of the <em>Selected </em>and the poet who compiled the more thematically unified <em>Collected</em>. Interestingly, Foucault defines the author as “a particular source of expression that, in more or less completed forms, is manifested equally well, and with similar validity, in works, sketches, letters, fragments, and so on” (111). Since Auden appears very differently in the two editions of his poetry, he seems to obtain two separate but related canons and, therefore, legacies. Foucault goes even further, claiming that the author function “does not refer purely and simply to a real individual, since it can give rise simultaneously to several selves” (113). Thus, the texts can stand without the true identity of the author who wrote them, and instead each can represent a new “self” for the author function. With the emergence of these selves, however, Foucault seems to represent an occurence more akin to a birth than a death. Yet, even in this new birth of selves, Barthes’ “death” remains as well, because the texts alone represent these identities, allowing for the existence of multiple Audens. There is, of course, Auden the man, who dies within the poems, which themselves represent the Auden of the <em>Collected </em>and the Auden of the<em>Selected</em>—two very different authors. Thus, Auden’s exclusions failed to alter his canon; they merely forged a new body of work, which remains in conversation with his older poems. v', 'Political Poetry and the Shaping of Auden’s Canon', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'political-poetry-and-the-shaping-of-audens-canon', '', '', '2012-03-23 15:38:46', '2012-03-23 15:38:46', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=228', 0, 'essay', '', 0),
(380, 3, '2012-04-10 15:30:49', '2012-04-10 15:30:49', 'Performance is at once an artist’s sanctuary and most dangerous territory. It is where performers coax precious pieces of their own sentiments to fit the shape of their art and present the finished product for all to appreciate, judge, or criticize. Musicians, actors, and dancers gamble their skills against time, betting that the quality of their presentation can keep up with the passage of every irreversible second and praying to be fortunate while they walk the line separating expression from exposure. Having invested half my lifetime of eighteen years into violin performance, I know music to be a source of solace, thrill, and embarrassment. If all goes well, performance is exhilarating. If mishaps occur, performance is merciless because anything that goes down cannot be taken back. Time cannot be manipulated.\n\nIn her essay “Forty-One False Starts,” when writing about the random and spontaneous nature of the artwork created by modern painter David Salle, Janet Malcolm draws a comparison between Salle’s art and the process of performance. She writes, “Every brushstroke is irrevocable. He doesn’t correct or repaint, ever. He works under the dire conditions of performance. Everything counts, nothing may be taken back, everything must always go relentlessly forward, and a mistake may be fatal” (507). The first thought this passage evoked in my mind concerned the undeniable what’s-done-is-done nature of performance. The second questioned why anyone would subject an art where erasers, new sheets of canvas, and repainting exist to the conditions of an art where each stroke is forever lost in time. I’d had enough experience in performance to believe that modern visual artists’ playing peek-a-boo with their blessed second chances was a stupid, ungrateful game.\n\nIf I rewind my memory back to the audition for my first major violin competition, playback begins with my ascent onto stage from behind heavy black curtains of dusty velvet. A hardwood stage floor illuminated in yellow light resonates pointedly upon each step of my high-heeled feet, and shadowed mezzanine seats stretch far into corners where light won’t reach them. There are three people sitting somewhere in the audience—three judges who will determine whether my performance is the best, the one worthy of a solo concerto concert and a good sum of money.\n\nAs I played that day, I created a rendition of Edouard Lalo’s Symphonie Espagnole that hit the notes and brought out the colors of desperado, gypsy fervor. It was beautiful and the music engulfed me entirely, but in my enthusiasm I neglected to check my own power. I sliced a three-string chord near the end of the piece with the passion it deserved—too much—and heard the discordant bang of broken violin strings as the bridge on my instrument snapped in half, killing the music right then and there. The silence that followed stunned me and my listeners as a disturbance that could not be forgiven. Needless to say, I did not win the competition. It had been a fatal mistake.\n\nIn an attempt to reconcile myself with David Salle’s desire to embrace this dangerous spontaneity of performance, I tried to imagine what my performance would have looked like if it had been in the form of a painting. I pictured fat brush strokes of colorful oil paint, in the center depicting a lovely gypsy woman dancing to Lalo’s Spanish music, caught in the picture mid-spin with her brilliant red dress twirling about her legs. Swirls of bright colors would surround her, the way the music engulfed me that day. She would be wearing noisy heels on a hardwood stage floor, and she would be dancing her heart out. Of course there would also be a gash of black paint splattered diagonally across the painting’s focal point, to symbolize that fatal chord. The gash would stick out like a sore thumb, confusing and upsetting viewers of the artwork; they would wonder in hesitant horror why the beauty of the painting had to be defaced by such a ghastly-looking mistake.\n\nThese are exactly the emotions David Salle’s art evokes. His paintings consist of broken, obscene images that don’t seem to belong together—“like an ugly mood,” according to Malcolm (505). He borrows images from previous artwork, takes nudity to the level of disturbance, and combines these items in an unnatural amalgamation. Malcolm, in describing her impression of his work, says “It was an abstracted sensation of dislocation, yearning, and loss that started resonating with my sense of what both art and life are like here in the late twentieth century. Suddenly Salle’s harsh artifice seemed heroic, an earnest of authenticity—without ceasing to seem perverse, against the grain” (517). His crude, jarring pictures communicate to their observers the same emotions as those of their creator. They capture the passion of the artist interminably, preserving the moments of mishap and admitting the realness of imperfection and awkwardness.\n\nAlthough the artist seems to imitate performance, I do not believe he actually strives to replicate it. The precarious nature of performance is only a lens into the fragility of something much more universal. Mistakes made in life and mistakes made in performance are analogously irrevocable. In imitation of this perception, Malcolm’s writing is organized into forty-one versions of a potential introductory passage. The scope of the entire work never goes beyond introduction; instead, forty-one separate attempts encompass a general conception of both Salle the artist and Salle the man. The concluding “false start,” as her title calls them, quotes Salle saying, “Have you ever thought that your real life hasn’t begun yet?” (530). If Malcolm’s discontinued false starts also subscribe to this yet-to-begin approach to life, the analogy she makes between her writing and her subject’s painting also comes to embrace Salle’s hopelessly expectant outlook. It is an attitude that is at once depressing and appealing; the success of Salle’s art professes to Malcolm’s observation that the coarseness of his art is the authenticity that makes it beautiful.\n\nThe unconventional form of Malcolm’s writing is, quite poetically, an illustration of three things at once: David Salle’s art, his approach to life, and the beauty of false starts in every sense of the phrase. I have taken Malcolm’s realization and used it as a model to understand my love for performance. If beauty in art and beauty in life can be linked via the espousal of mistakes, performance has one up on visual art. Though Salle never erases or repaints, he does exercise another option that visual artists have which is unavailable to performers—the option to destroy. Malcolm describes one painting of Salle’s that he botched: it depicted two ballet dancers. Once he deemed it a failure, Salle decided to obliterate the image in gray paint. “It’s a reject, a failed painting. It’s going to be cut up,” the artist said of the painting (513). Admitting how wonderful something was only accentuates the frustration with the mistake that killed it. The knowledge of what could have been is what drives a person to regret. In my life, neither that killer chord nor my memory of it is destructible, depriving me of the visual artist’s use of destruction as a means for denial, and his use of denial as a comforting pretense that conceals what happened.\n\nWithout the security of destruction, performance nurtures a rebellious kind of motivation. After I recovered from the stinging silence that followed that fatal chord, I took a dazed bow and heel-clicked my way back off stage, all the while biting down cries of astonishment and despair. At home a couple of days later, I found camaraderie in the experience of my favorite celebrity performer. I stared at the television, mouth agape, as figure skater Michelle Kwan took a fall in the 1998 Winter Olympics that cost her the Gold Medal and landed her in second place instead. However, as much as Kwan’s memory of that fall had to have served as a torturing reminder of the medal she could have deserved, it also had to play a part in her determination to keep trying. In the end, Michelle Kwan was the only skater of the three Olympic medalists that year who continued competitive skating.\n\nFollowing the tragedy of my first competition I went on to play in, and win, two others with the same piece. But even success will not erase failures in performance; they remain indestructible, preserved in memory. Here is where the connection that Malcolm delineates between art, performance, and life brings to the table a need to appreciate the imperfect. Beauty in art, performance, and life is the congregation of many parts of a whole, a series of imperfections that complement each other in the big picture. In this way, I realized that the fatal quality of performance actually translates into an economy by which mistakes raise the value of success. It is incredible how empowering the experience of a successful performance is. The immortality of mistakes is a threat intimidating enough to render each success absolutely priceless; the danger provides the thrill. Life is of the same economy. Mistakes make us human at the same time that they make us invincible, because they provide the motivation and inspiration to continue living. Such is a truth in the life of the artist, the performer, and the human being.\n\n&nbsp;', 'A Fatal Mistake', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '278-autosave', '', '', '2012-04-10 15:30:49', '2012-04-10 15:30:49', '', 278, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?p=380', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The choir director’s husband insisted that I talk to the interviewer, although the fellowship hour was almost over and the photographer had already left. I was hesitant, but I spoke to him honestly. When I read what I had said in the next Sunday’s Metro Section, I was half excited that my name was in The New York Times and half embarrassed at my lack of eloquence. But my candid answer served as a valuable looking glass into my opinion on the genocide and preserving its memory. In order for the genocide to be “recognized,” Turkey needs to admit that it occurred, but this can only happen if there is solid evidence supporting it. Every year, 1915 becomes more remote and genocide survivors more scarce. I am thus anxious for the genocide to be recognized by Turkey so that Armenians can “move on.” This article made me notice the extent to which I operate as a preservationist in many areas of my life, including my writing. But how does my writing relate to discovering better methods of persuading Turkey to recognize the genocide?\n\nThe theme of preservation is prominent in all three of my essays for this course. Each essay brought me closer to identifying the best way to preserve the past, even as I encountered and explored new problems of preserving memories. In my first essay, “New York City Apricots,” I focused on why immigrants retell their pasts instead of focusing on the present. I suggested that an exile is compelled to preserve and retell the past because it “continues to influence an exile’s life in the present” and because exiles often need to “prove [their] constancy and tame [their] fear of death” (6). In the case of my grandmother, she needed to continue retelling and reminding herself of the past because it brought her closer to it, so that the past, however difficult, seemed less remote, and death seemed more remote. When I realized in this essay that exiles must continue to remember the past, I was also reflecting on the importance of the Armenian Genocide in my life. In the New York Times quotation, I even stated that Armenians might “define” themselves by the genocide to keep that memory alive and to remind ourselves that our culture was not eliminated or allowed to die, but survived (Tirella). In my second essay, I explored how to record history to make it memorable. This concern stemmed from my desire to convince Turkey that the genocide occurred by making the history of the genocide vivid, relatable, and believable for the reader. As I discovered by the end of my second essay, making history more appealing also risks distorting reality. In my third essay, it made sense to investigate why certain writers would distort history. My culminating idea was that humans create distorted stories because they cannot handle failure, and those stories protect their idealized creations. In my three essays, I was subconsciously moving closer to answering the question of how to present a history of the Armenian Genocide so that it would be relatable and memorable, yet believable.\n\nLooking back, I notice that during all three progressions I often chose obscure quotations to propel me toward this goal. In my lens essay, I not only picked the source essay that nobody else in the class chose, but I also quoted the less prominent material from André Aciman’s “Shadow Cities,” such as his experiences in Rome. When trying to prove that an exile views all objects in the “key of loss,” I used Aciman’s description of old pictures of Rome, covered in “a series of colored transparencies,” which, when lifted, reveal “today’s ruins” (Aciman 47). Aciman invariably connects this image to his own internal state, allowing me to conclude that Aciman is looking at himself in his photos; Aciman’s current life is a ruin compared to his past. This roundabout analysis could have been simplified by quoting Aciman’s statement a few sentences earlier. He says that looking at the photographs or at any shadow city helps any exile, “like Narcissus leaning over a pool of water, find [himself] at every bend” (47). My unusual choice to draw out my claim with obscure quotations may reflect my fear of overlooking possible insights by excluding important but unnoticed examples. Perhaps I assumed that the more obvious quotes would be readily analyzed and emptied of insight and advice by others. My goal was to find what modern historians or genocide activists were doing wrong, and for that I drew insight from the less obvious. My care for often-ignored quotes may also reflect my concern with the way the Armenian Genocide has often been forgotten. In aspiring to remedy this problem of ignorance about the genocide, I chose to include quotes that I felt other readers would ignore.\n\nI also unwittingly made sure I quoted from each segment of my source essays. A curious instance occurred in my second essay, when I cited Georges Perec’s thoughts about noticing “not the exotic any more, but the endotic” (206). I felt compelled to quote from Perec’s third essay in the collection, even though I had not previously included it and was not planning to include it because it did not seem to contribute directly to my argument. This thoroughness demonstrated once more my subconscious fear of excluding an important detail that might hold the key to convincing Turkey and other governments to recognize the Armenian Genocide. All my choices as a writer mirror my treatment of the genocide. I was afraid time would erase the memory of the genocide, and that fear motivated my meticulous and thorough analyses. Perhaps I subconsciously thought that by being more thorough, I could learn how better to preserve the past and even shape a new approach to the genocide issue.\n\nAs I look back at the themes and conclusions I drew from each essay, I see that my main concerns when I finished each essay also share something surprising. Each time, I felt uncomfortable because I did not have enough space to address the full scope of issues I had intended to address. In my lens essay, I said I had “limited space” and that if “I had had more space, I would also have liked to explore my grandma’s use of ‘figments’ in her life in New York.” I longed to explore how my grandma preserved her past and how her techniques compared to Aciman’s methods. I wanted to learn how to incorporate methods of preservation into my own life in order to apply them to the genocide, so I regretted not being able to delve further into this inquiry. In my third essay, I did not have enough space or time to add “more about other aspects of [Jonathan] Lethem’s life.” I seemed to have an underlying anxiety about including everything, as if I could attempt to preserve every aspect of the genocide or as if I needed more information to better solve this problem.\n\nGenocides, battles, and mindless killings fill the pages of history and the newspapers of our modern day, but the Armenian Genocide is unique in that it has never been recognized or officially declared a genocide by its perpetrators. Figures such as Hitler have exploited this lack of attention to the Armenian Genocide. Hitler believed that the Holocaust would be forgotten, since “Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?” My underlying explorations, quoting tendencies, and anxieties reflected in these three essays are directly related to this lack of recognition. My anxiety to preserve the memory of the genocide produced a corresponding anxiety about writing my essays that drove me to explore problems in peculiar ways, quote material that did not seem obviously relevant, and worry even more than usual about making editorial comments. I wanted to be meticulous and thorough and to be a new kind of historian because I saw the failure of attempts to convince Turkey of the genocide’s reality. However, I cannot solve the problem of genocide recognition, no matter how many essays I write to explore it. This type of idealistic aspiration for perfect preservation by one person is impossible. But I can continue to develop and explore my own methods of preservation, so that anyone who comes in contact with me or my writing will remember. ', 'Me, a Historian?', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '245-autosave', '', '', '2012-02-29 23:30:13', '2012-02-29 23:30:13', '', 245, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?p=379', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Then a voice rose above the muffled sounds of the crowd, followed by another, and then another: Martin Luther King, Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech, interlaced with words by Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali. The three men’s tones resonated with the rhythm of the African djembe beating in the backdrop. Soon, Christian McBride’s anticipated bass riff joined the refrain. The great speeches faded along with the drum line, and the jazz took hold, as was permissible since the foundation had been laid: Jazz is a music, a history, a culture. That is, African-American culture is intrinsic to jazz.\r\n\r\nThe music has its roots in post-Reconstruction New Orleans, at a time when Jim Crow laws lumped Creoles and blacks into one marginalized subgroup. Jazz evolved as a synthesis of “African-derived rhythmic, tonal, and improvisational senses” and French-inspired Creole string ensembles (Hall 36). The word “jazz,” in fact, derives from the Creole jass, a slang term for sex. Granted, Creoles are light-skinned and hardly black in the usual sense of the word. To that Perry Hall, director of African American studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, adds, “Creole participation in jazz came directly as a result of the discovery by Creole musicians of their Blackness” (47). In other words, Creoles began to play jazz after relocation to and degradation in the United States made them party to the black experience. Yet when jazz gained mainstream popularity in 1917, its face was neither black nor Creole. The first jazz record released to the masses was that of the self-proclaimed “Original Dixieland Jazz Band,” a group of five white musicians (Hall 38). In the years that followed, a white musician by the name of Paul Whiteman enjoyed great success performing “symphonic jazz,” a style that tamed the “primitive rhythms” of original jazz and therein became “more acceptable to white audiences” (Hall 38). In uprooting jazz from its African-American culture, Whiteman grossed one million dollars in a single year in the 1920s and was dubbed the “King of Jazz” (Hall 39).\r\n<h2><strong>Hail to the Thief </strong></h2>\r\nPaul Whiteman’s success arguably lacked merit, but it was hardly unique. Since Whiteman, white men have perpetually sat atop the thrones of black music. For example, in the 1930s, Benny Goodman, a white man, became the “King of Swing” (Hall 31). Decades later, Elvis Presley was crowned the “King of Rock ‘N’ Roll.” In 2003, Rolling Stone declared Justin Timberlake the “King of R&amp;B” (Kitwana 156). And of course there’s Eminem, who continues to be revered as “the Elvis of hip-hop” (Kitwana 139). How can a white man be the face of black music?\r\n\r\nTo answer this question, we must examine the long-standing tradition of mainstream absorption of black musical forms (Hall 32). Beginning with jazz and leading up to hip-hop, white America has appropriated black music as its own. When whites cannot stake claims to black music—as in the case of hip-hop—the nature of the relationship between mainstream society and African-American culture is simply exploitative. This essay will examine the ethics of cross-cultural musical appropriation in an attempt to discover why the Elvises and Eminems are able to reap the glory of African-American cultural innovation.\r\n<h2><strong>Gillespie, Gifts-Giving, and Genocide</strong></h2>\r\n“You can’t steal a gift. Bird gave the world his music, and if you can hear it you can have it,” Dizzy Gillespie declared in defense of Phil Woods, a white saxophonist who had been accused of poaching Charlie “the Bird” Parker’s style (Lethem 70). Jonathan Lethem, in his essay “The Ecstasy of Influence: A Plagiarism,” draws inspiration from Gillespie in criticizing copyrights and exploring the concept of a “gift economy” (65). According to Lethem, works of art exist in such an economy, which is rooted in the poignancy of the product (65-66). This gift economy is independent of the market economy in which art and music are commoditized because “a gift conveys an uncommodifiable surplus of inspiration” (Lethem 66). No doubt black musical forms—as is true of all art—function in such an economy both in giving and receiving. To a greater extent, rock ‘n’ roll connoisseur Theodore Gracyk questions whether there was ever an African-American musical form “that wasn’t already the result of miscegenation and hybridization” (86). For example, as noted earlier, the first jazz musicians drew inspiration from both “the French tradition of military marching bands” and the European-style string orchestra (Hall 36). As Lethem would argue for any art, the making of music is a continual process of borrowing and sharing. Thus, Gillespie and Gracyk are right to say that black artists cannot claim exclusivity to black music. But what, then, distinguishes the use of black music by white musicians from the continual borrowing and sharing of musical property upon which black music is built?\r\n\r\nIn truth, the gift analogy is oversimplified. You certainly cannot “steal” a gift if it has been given to you, but you can misuse it. When appropriating black musical forms, white artists such as Paul Whiteman often reshape and redefine the styles to “minimize their association with ‘Blackness’” (Hall 32).  This type of cultural appropriation is less an exchange of gifts than “a virtual stripping of Black musical genius and aesthetic innovation” (Hall 33). To Gracyk, the very process of reshaping is what grants “those engaged in appropriation … some right to claim ownership of the music they perform” (107). Thus, symphonic jazz can be appreciated independently of the black musical style from which it is derived, and its creation gives whites some cultural ownership of jazz. Yet Gracyk fails to recognize the effect of appropriation on the original musical form, which distinguishes unethical appropriation from the harmless inspiration that Lethem supports. In the most basic sense, a gift can be considered “misused” when it is damaged through usage. As is often the case when mainstream America whitewashes black cultural property and then claims it as its own, the result is what philosopher Amiri Baraka, one of the greatest voices of “spoken word” jazz, describes as a “cultural genocide” (quoted in Gracyk 110).\r\n\r\nGracyk rejects this notion of cultural genocide. According to Gracyk, “the analogy with genocide hinges on the thesis that, were it not for the nonreciprocal behavior of the cultural imperialist, the ‘dominated’ culture would not have changed” (110). Because African-American culture would have evolved independently of white influence, white America’s reshaping of black musical forms, he claims, simply gives rise to a “legitimate transformation” (110). Gracyk depicts this instance of cultural appropriation as natural, yet black musical forms have tended to evolve unwillingly. New forms emerge in hopes of reestablishing “the distinctiveness of Black music in a given sociohistorical context” (Hall 32). What is particularly unnatural is the continual need for African Americans to reassert their cultural autonomy. For example, when rock music became more closely associated with Elvis than Chuck Berry, black musicians such as Ray Charles and Sam Cooke fused rhythm and blues with “gospel-inflected harmonies” to create what became known in the 1960s as “soul” (Hall 44). Such innovation is less the result of dynamism than of marginalization. Cultural genocide arises when the art is separated from the people (Hall 31). The heavily-consumed, appropriated forms are “ineffective as expressions and affirmations of the unique cultural experiences from which they arise” (Hall 32). Cultural meanings are thereby often erased (Hall 35), as happened when whites appropriated soul music—which spoke to black emotion and struggle during the Civil Rights Movement—and called it “disco” (Hall 45). When whites appropriate black music, the art is stripped not only of its cultural identity but also of its ability to function in the gift economy. Although Lethem agrees that one cannot steal a gift, he argues that one can destroy it: “Where there is no gift there is no art, [thus] it may be possible to destroy a work of art by converting it into a pure commodity” (66). When black musical forms are completely dissociated from their emotional foundation—as in the case of soul’s devolution into disco—the result is no longer a work of art but a mere commodity, which Lethem defines by its inability to create a genuine emotional connection (66). However, the mainstream need not appropriate black music in order to commoditize it. We see this in the case of hip-hop. Though rap has been reinterpreted by a myriad of races, including whites, it is nevertheless identified with African-American culture—a culture that is now bought and sold.\r\n<h2><strong>Back Yard DJs to NWA: Origins of Hip Hop</strong></h2>\r\n<blockquote>Rap in general dates all the way back to the motherland, where tribes would use call-and-response chants. In the 1930s and 1940s you had Cab Calloway pioneering his style of jazz rhyming. The sixties you had the love style of rapping, with Isaac Hayes, Barry White, and the poetry style of rapping with the Last Poets, the Watts poets and the militant style of rapping with brothers like Malcolm X and Minister Louis Farrakhan.\r\n–Afrika Bambaata, 1993\r\n(quoted in Perkins 2)</blockquote>\r\nRap is revolutionary as a black musical form because every path traces its lineage back to an element of African-American culture. Granted, today there are countless cultural varieties of hip-hop from Asian to Hispanic rap; still, all of these styles are indisputably derived from black music. So far, hip-hop has inspired imitations but it has nevertheless resisted cultural genocide. That is not to say, however, that it has escaped exploitation.\r\n\r\nHip-hop was born in the South Bronx in the mid 1970s as the product of the yard culture of West Kingston brought to New York by Jamaican immigrants in the late ’60s: “Yard DJs brought huge speakers and turntables to the slums, where they rapped over the simple bass lines of the ska and reggae beats … The DJ ruled during hip hop’s early days, and it was the DJ who established the foundations for the lyricist (MC)” (Perkins 6). In the 1980s, black middle-class rappers L.L. Cool J and the group Run DMC, both from suburban Queens, were representative of the first wave of hip hop artists to achieve mainstream success (Perkins 15)—that is, until\r\ntheir minimalist style gave way to controversial “gangsta” rap in the 1990s (Perkins 18). “The gangsta was epitomized by the now defunct group NWA (Niggas with Attitude), which consisted of the MCs Dr. Dre, Ezy-E, Ice Cube, MC Ren ... and Ice-T” (Perkins 18). Then came the “message rap” of artists such as Long Island’s Public Enemy, which was followed by the much less political “booty rap” of groups like 2 Live Crew (Perkins 19-20). Rap’s decades-long transformation exemplifies the natural cultural dynamics about which Gracyk theorizes. Its cultural autonomy remained intact at this point. Then, in the late 1990s, a white rapper from Detroit emerged on the scene and started down the path to becoming hip-hop’s Elvis.\r\n<h2> <strong>The Blue-Eyed Baller</strong></h2>\r\n<blockquote>“If I have a cup of coffee that is too strong for me because it is too black, I weaken it by pouring cream into it.”(2)\r\n–Malcolm X, 1963</blockquote>\r\nIn 2003, a well-established hip-hop magazine, The Source, acted on a personal vendetta against the industry’s most successful artist of the time, white rapper Eminem. In an attempt to derail the rapper’s career, The Source published lyrics from unreleased tracks by Eminem that featured blatantly racist attacks on black women: “Girls I like have big butts / no they don’t, ’cause I don’t like that nigga shit … Black and whites they sometimes mix / But black girls only want your money / cause they be dumb chicks” (quoted in Kitwana 136). After a public apology in which Eminem attributed his racist remarks to teenage angst and bitter resentment toward an African-American ex-girlfriend, Eminem’s success and popularity were unaffected (Kitwana 141). But The Source’s crusade against the white rapper did not end there; the magazine’s greatest concern was not that rap’s most successful artist was racist, but that he was white and that hip-hop rightly belonged to a black youth subculture (Kitwana 136). Granted, Eminem was not the first white rapper to enjoy mainstream success. In fact, the first No. 1 hip-hop album was the all white hip-hop group The Beastie Boys’ 1986 License to Ill (White 201). Similarly, the first hip-hop single to top the charts was Vanilla Ice’s “Ice, Ice Baby” in 1991 (Perkins 37). But the most successful white rappers often parodied the genre, which led some listeners to write them off as “wiggers.” Eminem’s music was revered as genuine hip-hop, and The Source feared the familiarity of his success. Countless times, owners of The Source declared that Eminem was on “the fast track to becoming hip-hop’s Elvis” (Kitwana 136). That is, as had happened with Elvis, yet another black musical form would be more closely identified with an iconic white artist than with black artists.\r\n\r\nIn the early 1950s, Sam Phillips—the Sun Records executive who helped Elvis rise to stardom—proclaimed, “If I could find a white man who had the Negro sound and the Negro feel, I could make a billion dollars” (quoted in Perkins 38). Unlike his wannabe predecessors, Eminem can produce rap with that very “Negro feel.” His lyrics have thematic similarities to some black rap because Eminem grew up in the marginalized class of impoverished white Americans. Hence, his music preserves the emotional aspect of the hip-hop gift. Perhaps Eminem’s music exemplifies hip-hop’s ability to function as a gift economy. After all, whereas Elvis’ stardom catalyzed rock ‘n’ roll to become the predominately white musical form it is today, Eminem’s success has not given hip-hop a white face. Has the music industry evolved beyond racial exploitation, or is the mainstream interested in keeping hip-hop black?\r\n<h2><strong>Mr. Ambassador at the Minstrel Show</strong></h2>\r\nIn late 2002, the New York Times Magazine ran a cover story on hip-hop’s cultural bandit, Marshall Mathers, a.k.a. Eminem, and titled it “Mr. Ambassador” (Kitwana 160). The astute title was fitting for the rap superstar who had previously been labeled the “king” of hip-hop, for Eminem is just that: the envoy of white America to the hip-hop nation. Eminem has attracted many mainstream listeners to hip-hop essentially because he looks like they do. Before Eminem, true hip-hop—which excludes the whitewashed works of Vanilla Ice and the Beastie Boys—was exclusively black and therefore incomprehensible to most white audiences. It does not follow, however, that Enimem is the white man’s rapper. Quite the contrary: “although rap is still proportionately more popular among blacks, its primary audience is white and lives in the suburbs” (Samuels, quoted in Kitwana 82). In February 2004, Forbes reported that of an estimated 45 million hip-hop consumers between the ages of 13 and 34, eighty percent are white (Kitwana 82). This begs the question: Why do white people love hip-hop, that is, hip-hop in its true form? According to pop journalist Arnold White, “Rap flourished into corporate-sponsored hip hop because of the symbiosis that held whites enthralled to Blacks and kept Blacks indentured” (183). White America’s embrace of hip-hop culture is hardly a move toward racial acceptance and cultural understanding. Rather, it is the product of “white supremacy (i.e. black kids selling black images of black criminality and inferiority and white kids buying them to reinforce their superiority)” (Kitwana 103). Hip-hop perpetuates the American tradition of minstrelsy, except that rather than whites painting their faces black, black artists have succumbed to stereotypes of themselves. In the case of hip-hop, white supremacy is enforced not through imitation but consumption of the “minstrel portrait” of black “dehumanization” (Baraka 328). In the eyes of the mainstream, hip-hop reinforces conventions and stereotypes of blackness that foster white power.\r\n\r\nThough Eminem may honor hip-hop as a gift, the mainstream renders it a commodity. A commodity fails to establish an emotional connection between two people (Lethem 66). Though rap music showcases black suffering, mainstream America receives it not with compassion but with mockery—white supremacy prevents an emotional connection. Previous musical generations saw white artists destroying the gift of black music by failing to recreate its poignancy; the hip-hop generation sees poignancy destroyed through direct commoditization. In the case of hip-hop, whites are able to reap the power and profits of black culture not by marginalizing black ingenuity but by exploiting it. Simply put: whites couldn’t do it better themselves.\r\n<h2><strong>Why Deny the Obvious, Child?</strong></h2>\r\nHip-hop may have broken the appropriative trend between mainstream America and black music, but it has done little to end the marginalization of African Americas. It seems that the key issue is not so much the act of appropriation as the driving force behind it. Incidentally, when discussing mainstream absorption of black music, few scholars aside from Theodore Gracyk acknowledge its contributions. We cannot deny that “rock would not exist without  propriation” (Gracyk 97), nor can we blame individual artists for acts of appropriation.\r\n\r\nTake, for example, Paul Simon’s Graceland, which is often criticized for Simon’s arguably exploitative use of a group of South African folk singers to enhance the tone of the album and, ultimately, his own success. The accusation runs: “Visually and aurally, Simon appears as the white master who exerts a benign rule over his black subjects” (Mitchell, quoted in Gracyk 91). Yet to suggest that Simon’s work with the South African choir had imperialistic motives is excessive. In truth, he was motivated by “a genuine love of South African music” (Gracyk 98); we cannot criticize him for that. Concomitantly, the South African tribal leader Joseph Shabalala praised Simon for “the opportunity to disclose [their] music all over the world” (quoted in Gracyk 105). Though not Simon’s fault, Graceland failed to inspire interest in South African music. Most people I know who own the album admit to skipping the only track that features the South African choir almost exclusively. The only music Graceland successfully promoted was that of Paul Simon—just as when Keith Richards and Mick Jagger started the Rolling Stones, in Richards’ words, “to turn other people on to” African-American blues artist Muddy Waters (quoted in Gracyk 15), they really only turned people on to the Rolling Stones.\r\n\r\nThe crime, then, is not the use of black musical gifts but the bigotry that often leads to their commoditization. The success of Graceland and the Rolling Stones speaks to whites’ lack of interest in the black experience and their desire not simply to steal black music, but more basically to de-contextualize it—that is, to avoid establishing emotional connections. Appreciation of black music goes hand in hand with appreciation of black people, except in the case of hip-hop through which blacks have allowed themselves to be dehumanized. That is not to say that non-hip-hop black musicians enjoy no mainstream success—we know that to be untrue. Rather, mainstream America tends to depreciate black music, for connecting emotionally with such works of art might bring about an understanding of black suffering that would undermine white supremacy. Moreover, the commoditization of black music continues to foster white power by granting financial success to those who control the music industry: whites. The power disparity between whites and blacks in the music industry suggests that music is another tool the mainstream uses to perpetuate black marginalization. As Amiri Baraka has observed, “The laws once openly stated blacks inferior. Now it is the relationship these laws uphold that maintain the de facto oppression” (329). In the shift from de jure to de facto racism, mainstream America reshaped bigotry in much the same way it did black music—through the simple process of whitewashing.\r\n<h2>Note</h2>\r\n1.

How should I add my own? How does one begin to choose the words with which to begin, with so many words to begin with? After twenty eight years, having written hundreds of songs, shoeboxes of letters, binders of essays, a novel, comedy sketches, research papers, short stories, a handful of bad poems, chapters of never-to-be-completed books, notes to girls, chapter summaries, thousands of emails, text messages and IM’s, blogs, applications, two-week-notices, and scenes for screenplays, I am still intimidated by beginnings. That blank page, that blinking cursor—especially that blinking cursor. It flashes like dots on a digital clock that wants to be set: I will keep time for you, those dots say; just tell me to begin. If only beginning were a matter like time. But writing is not as one-dimensional and unidirectional. There are 1,440 minutes to set a clock to, and from that point there is only forward movement, and only one right time of day. But when I write I can begin in medias res; I can begin in the past and move forward, or in the future and move backward. There are infinite ideas, innumerable reasons, limitless tones, fathomless times and interminable ways to begin a piece of writing. The question is, and always will be: With so many possibilities, how to begin?\r\n\r\nI have learned from experience to trust my experience, and I recommend you do the same. Recall the past you have to draw from, all the sources you have at your disposal. Remember your first memory, your own beginning: you, gasping for life-breath, staring up through soapy water at your dad’s calm face as he washes out the baby shampoo. Remember that he is a songwriter and your mother is a nurse. Remember 101 Gilette Drive and the woods out back. Remember your grandfather who was buried on your eighteenth birthday, your sisters who live in other states. Who else remembers them exactly like you? Who else’s wisdom has been shaped like yours? Consider how Thoreau made everything seem so simple and beautiful when life was in fact the opposite, and how Tom Robbins shocked you by placing Jesus’ corpse in the pantry. Reflect on the awe you felt reading Toni Morrison’s terrifying eidetic images, and how Emerson inspired you to rely on yourself, whoever that was. You have read Einstein, Kundera, Buddha, and Tolstoy. You saw an old lady spilled out of her wheelchair on Burbank Boulevard covered in blood and urine. An intoxicated Bobby Brown offered to buy your song in a studio in Hollywood at 3:00 a.m. These are the sources you bring to your beginning, and they are unique. Your past contains volumes.\r\n\r\nAt the same instant, remember to forget your past and to approach the beginning like a beginner. When we write about subjects that are new to us, as we are often assigned to do in school, beginning like a beginner should be natural. However, as students, we inevitably consider ignorance our weakness, and even when it is to the detriment of our intellectual growth (and it always is) we hide that ignorance behind large words and false revelations rather than engage the unknown, the unexperienced. This is unfortunate, because inexperience is as valuable as experience. For example, I knew little about art when I was assigned an essay on the topic. Yet because of my past success as a writer of essays and my desire to get an ‘A,’ I walked into the Metropolitan Museum of Art with cockiness, thinking that by the end of my visit I would have something profound to say about art. It might have led to a phony paper about a museum experience, had I not remembered my professor’s explicit instruction: “Don’t try to be profound; just see what happens between you and the art.” This did not immediately make sense, as my fear of my own ignorance was so menacing. As I walked around the exhibits, however, wanting as usual to use intellectual tricks to veil my ignorance, I discovered a way to use my ignorance as an intellectual trick. Instead of being afraid of looking at art, I asked: Why am I afraid of looking at art? When I felt unmoved by Chinese sculpture, or drawn to one dark painting amongst many bright others, I asked: Why do I think Chinese sculpture is boring? And out of all the paintings in the room, why am I drawn to the darkest one? What I found by turning my ignorance into intellectual curiosity is a connection with my subject that I had always considered a disconnection; that the fear I have of art connected me strongly to art; that the boredom I felt connected me directly to the Chinese sculpture, and that the darkness I was attracted to was not really in the painting, but in the way I saw it as an inexperienced viewer. Remember yourself as a child, beginning with no experience at all, asking why this, why that, and see how it led you to so many conclusions. Inexperience breeds questions, and questions are beginnings. Begin as a beginner.\r\n\r\nTake some time to forget about yourself too, acknowledging the many thinkers who thought before you. For instance, if you are asked to write about nostalgia like I was, and you do not know how to begin, go to the library and begin as someone else. Put on a suit tailored in Vienna, scratch your coiffed white beard, light your pipe and explain to the work-study student at the circulation desk that his nostalgia is merely a manifestation of a repressed urge to sleep with his mother. Build yourself a small house in back of Ralph Waldo Emerson’s shelf and live there for two years. Reflect on the pond between the past and future. Think about the plantation you escaped, the daughter you murdered, and wonder why you cannot stop thinking about where you come from. Invariably, when you become someone else, when you really crawl into another’s psyche and speak with his or her authority, you will feel your own thoughts rise up and demand attention. They may be disagreements, agreements, arguments, discomforts, or elaborations. Whatever they are, write them down, and you have begun.\r\n\r\nStill, be careful in the library. Research your topic thoroughly, become many authors in turn, but remember at once that while all of the authors you refer to are right, all of them are also wrong. Newton explains that laws are constant and universal, and he is right. However, Foucault shows that laws shift according to local circumstance and he is also right. Albert Camus says he in not an existentialist, but critics say he is: Both are right. Richard Dawkins proves God does not exist and he is wrong. Descartes proves God does exist, and he is wrong, too. The library exists not for you to read and adopt someone else’s thoughts, for if this were the case there would be no use beginning a new work at all. The library keeps records of where great thoughts have ended: It is full of conclusions. Begin at those conclusions.\r\n\r\nWhen I sit down to write, I remember that I can say anything and nothing. I remember that I have been delivered to this moment via a unique and circuitous lifetime, and that my past is indistinguishable from millions of other pasts. I remember that what I am about to write will be momentously important and ultimately meaningless. I am a theist and a nihilist.\r\n\r\nYou may be frustrated by all of my advice, which, summarily, recommends that you trust your past while dismissing your past; to trust others’ thoughts while simultaneously discounting them. It all seems so contradictory, but in fact it is as methodical as time. For consider your experience and the recorded experience of others as a sort of intellectual past, which you can no more visit than you can return to being a child submerged in soapy water. Then think of your own inexperience as a reflection of a vast blank future. Though we naturally toe the line in the middle—in the intellectual present—as students and self-conscious beings we pretend otherwise. To save face, we might hide in some truth we learned in the past or jump to conclusions which our experience cannot possibly substantiate. Conclusions are for the future. Begin by fearlessly acknowledging the reality of the intellectual present and the possibility it contains, which is conveniently marked for us by that blinking cursor at the top of a blank page.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'How to Begin', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'how-to-begin', '', '', '2012-03-23 15:21:05', '2012-03-23 15:21:05', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=233', 0, 'essay', '', 0),

That blank page, that blinking cursor—especially that blinking cursor. It flashes like dots on a digital clock that wants to be set: I will keep time for you, those dots say; just tell me to begin. If only beginning were a matter like time. But writing is not as one-dimensional and unidirectional. There are 1,440 minutes to set a clock to, and from that point there is only forward movement, and only one right time of day. But when I write I can begin in medias res; I can begin in the past and move forward, or in the future and move backward. There are infinite ideas, innumerable reasons, limitless tones, fathomless times and interminable ways to begin a piece of writing. The question is, and always will be: With so many possibilities, how to begin?\r\n\r\nI have learned from experience to trust my experience, and I recommend you do the same. Recall the past you have to draw from, all the sources you have at your disposal. Remember your first memory, your own beginning: you, gasping for life-breath, staring up through soapy water at your dad’s calm face as he washes out the baby shampoo. Remember that he is a songwriter and your mother is a nurse. Remember 101 Gilette Drive and the woods out back. Remember your grandfather who was buried on your eighteenth birthday, your sisters who live in other states. Who else remembers them exactly like you? Who else’s wisdom has been shaped like yours? Consider how Thoreau made everything seem so simple and beautiful when life was in fact the opposite, and how Tom Robbins shocked you by placing Jesus’ corpse in the pantry. Reflect on the awe you felt reading Toni Morrison’s terrifying eidetic images, and how Emerson inspired you to rely on yourself, whoever that was. You have read Einstein, Kundera, Buddha, and Tolstoy. You saw an old lady spilled out of her wheelchair on Burbank Boulevard covered in blood and urine. An intoxicated Bobby Brown offered to buy your song in a studio in Hollywood at 3:00 a.m. These are the sources you bring to your beginning, and they are unique. Your past contains volumes.\r\n\r\nAt the same instant, remember to forget your past and to approach the beginning like a beginner. When we write about subjects that are new to us, as we are often assigned to do in school, beginning like a beginner should be natural. However, as students, we inevitably consider ignorance our weakness, and even when it is to the detriment of our intellectual growth (and it always is) we hide that ignorance behind large words and false revelations rather than engage the unknown, the unexperienced. This is unfortunate, because inexperience is as valuable as experience. For example, I knew little about art when I was assigned an essay on the topic. Yet because of my past success as a writer of essays and my desire to get an ‘A,’ I walked into the Metropolitan Museum of Art with cockiness, thinking that by the end of my visit I would have something profound to say about art. It might have led to a phony paper about a museum experience, had I not remembered my professor’s explicit instruction: “Don’t try to be profound; just see what happens between you and the art.” This did not immediately make sense, as my fear of my own ignorance was so menacing. As I walked around the exhibits, however, wanting as usual to use intellectual tricks to veil my ignorance, I discovered a way to use my ignorance as an intellectual trick. Instead of being afraid of looking at art, I asked: Why am I afraid of looking at art? When I felt unmoved by Chinese sculpture, or drawn to one dark painting amongst many bright others, I asked: Why do I think Chinese sculpture is boring? And out of all the paintings in the room, why am I drawn to the darkest one? What I found by turning my ignorance into intellectual curiosity is a connection with my subject that I had always considered a disconnection; that the fear I have of art connected me strongly to art; that the boredom I felt connected me directly to the Chinese sculpture, and that the darkness I was attracted to was not really in the painting, but in the way I saw it as an inexperienced viewer. Remember yourself as a child, beginning with no experience at all, asking why this, why that, and see how it led you to so many conclusions. Inexperience breeds questions, and questions are beginnings. Begin as a beginner.\r\n\r\nTake some time to forget about yourself too, acknowledging the many thinkers who thought before you. For instance, if you are asked to write about nostalgia like I was, and you do not know how to begin, go to the library and begin as someone else. Put on a suit tailored in Vienna, scratch your coiffed white beard, light your pipe and explain to the work-study student at the circulation desk that his nostalgia is merely a manifestation of a repressed urge to sleep with his mother. Build yourself a small house in back of Ralph Waldo Emerson’s shelf and live there for two years. Reflect on the pond between the past and future. Think about the plantation you escaped, the daughter you murdered, and wonder why you cannot stop thinking about where you come from. Invariably, when you become someone else, when you really crawl into another’s psyche and speak with his or her authority, you will feel your own thoughts rise up and demand attention. They may be disagreements, agreements, arguments, discomforts, or elaborations. Whatever they are, write them down, and you have begun.\r\n\r\nStill, be careful in the library. Research your topic thoroughly, become many authors in turn, but remember at once that while all of the authors you refer to are right, all of them are also wrong. Newton explains that laws are constant and universal, and he is right. However, Foucault shows that laws shift according to local circumstance and he is also right. Albert Camus says he in not an existentialist, but critics say he is: Both are right. Richard Dawkins proves God does not exist and he is wrong. Descartes proves God does exist, and he is wrong, too. The library exists not for you to read and adopt someone else’s thoughts, for if this were the case there would be no use beginning a new work at all. The library keeps records of where great thoughts have ended: It is full of conclusions. Begin at those conclusions.\r\n\r\nWhen I sit down to write, I remember that I can say anything and nothing. I remember that I have been delivered to this moment via a unique and circuitous lifetime, and that my past is indistinguishable from millions of other pasts. I remember that what I am about to write will be momentously important and ultimately meaningless. I am a theist and a nihilist.\r\n\r\nYou may be frustrated by all of my advice, which, summarily, recommends that you trust your past while dismissing your past; to trust others’ thoughts while simultaneously discounting them. It all seems so contradictory, but in fact it is as methodical as time. For consider your experience and the recorded experience of others as a sort of intellectual past, which you can no more visit than you can return to being a child submerged in soapy water. Then think of your own inexperience as a reflection of a vast blank future. Though we naturally toe the line in the middle—in the intellectual present—as students and self-conscious beings we pretend otherwise. To save face, we might hide in some truth we learned in the past or jump to conclusions which our experience cannot possibly substantiate. Conclusions are for the future. Begin by fearlessly acknowledging the reality of the intellectual present and the possibility it contains, which is conveniently marked for us by that blinking cursor at the top of a blank page.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'How to Begin', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '233-autosave', '', '', '2012-02-27 07:39:16', '2012-02-27 07:39:16', '', 233, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?p=234', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The first one starts with a B. I proceed to the second stack. Fast forward as I move up and down the stacks, collecting an ever-larger pile of books. Come back to real time. I set the pile down by a computer and check some subject lines again to make sure I don’t miss anything. Sure enough, many more promising titles pop up. I write them down. Cut. The pile has doubled in size. I begin the process of whittling them down, opening each and glancing through to see if it’s actually relevant. Cut. Three books have been discarded. I pick up the pile and take it to the circulation desk. There’s a woman in front of me trying to find something on reserve. She’s taking a really long time. My arms are going to fall off. It turns out the book she needs is in another library, and she leaves. The girl behind the desk apologizes. I drop the books on the counter. When she’s done checking them out, I spend several minutes trying to stuff them all into my bag. The last one goes in, though the bag won’t close. I exit the main doors.\r\n\r\nTalking head shot: Me. That was the third paper I had to do for this class. I’d hoped\r\nwriting it would be a perfected process that I had arrived at through writing the first two. But it definitely wasn’t. It was actually more like going over the edge of a cliff. All the bad habits and the guilty pleasures that made the first two papers difficult manifested themselves more than ever in this third and greatest paper. There was just so much potential for taking the topic anywhere I wanted. I guess I took it everywhere I wanted.\r\n\r\n<em>New scene: small classroom at El Dorado Community College. The desks are filled\r\nwith college students, both right out of high school and much older. The professor\r\nannounces the guest speaker Mas Hatano, a victim of the Japanese concentration\r\ncamps during World War II. An old, white-haired man begins to tell his tale. At the back of the classroom, an eight-year-old girl sits with her legs dangling from the chair, an open Lisa Frank notebook in front of her, her pencil at the ready. Narration: When I was little, my mom used to take me out of school on occasion to come to her history classes at the local college. Sometimes it was for guest speakers like Japanese internment camp survivor Mas Hatano, or feminist historian Sally Roesch Wagner; sometimes it was simply for her lectures, when they were particularly interesting. I reveled in taking notes on the various discourses, and prided myself on remembering what I’d learned. I was particularly happy when I knew something that the rest of the class didn’t, like that the “Three Sisters” of the Iroquois was the tribe’s term for their sacred trio of staple crops—corn, beans, and squash.</em>\r\n\r\nThe girl has filled up a page with notes, and turns it over. Cut to the Central Library in Sacramento. The same girl, perhaps a year older, has covered a table on the third floor with books on coral reefs. She sits in the chair and pours over a particularly large and colorful book. Others open to reveal pictures and descriptions of clown fish, anemones, the bleaching phenomenon, and small sharks. Her notebook, upgraded now to a red Five-Star, is open to a page half-filled with notes. Narration continues: While other children avoided homework, preferring to play outside or, when we reached the fourth grade, to listen to the Spice Girls and read Nickelodeon magazine, I expanded my homework time, even creating assignments of my own. I loved researching and writing up reports, whether it was on marine biology or paleontology or the Big Bang. I would create PowerPoint presentations to showcase what I had learned and share it with my family. Not that my papers and presentations were amazing pieces of polished research; in fact, they were quite\r\nsimplistic and generally included as many colorful pictures as possible. But the fact was that I truly loved learning. I loved, and still love, being able to explore the reaches of modern knowledge and expand my own horizons through research and reading.\r\n\r\n<em>Scene shift: a four-year-old girl, clearly the younger version of the earlier girl,\r\nstands near a sunny preschool playground with two other girls.\r\nGirl 1: What would you wish for if you found a genie?\r\nGirl 2: I’d wish I was a princess. Then I’d wish for all the ice cream in the world.\r\nThen I’d wish for more wishes!\r\nGirl 1: What would you wish for?\r\nMe: I would wish I knew everything.\r\nNarration: Then came high school.</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Scene shift: a high school classroom. Fluorescent lighting, window blinds shut,\r\nlinoleum floor, synthetic desks filled with sleepy sixteen-year-olds. The white board\r\nreads, “Welcome to the SAT I.” The proctor pulls out a stopwatch. “You have 25\r\nminutes to write your essay. Begin.”</em>\r\n\r\nNarration: My days of long, spontaneous research projects ended when I no longer\r\nhad time for them. High school meant hours of assigned homework every day, as\r\nwell as hours of “to-do”s that were not homework, such as practicing for orchestra,\r\npreparing for Mock Trial, or dealing with college applications. As time allowed only for learning what was being taught in class, the luxury of intellectual exploration disappeared. Even when writing papers, we focused not on preparing a body of research but on being able to write a reasonably coherent piece in a restricted period of time.\r\n\r\n<em>New Scene: 412 Pupin. No windows, only blackboards, the sounds of construction in\r\nthe background. Eleven Columbia freshmen, several wearing sweatshirts bearing the\r\nname of their new alma mater, sit in a semicircle of black desks.

The village traces the\r\ncurve of the water going off toward a large river; mountains covered in evergreens\r\nstretch up on all sides, their peaks capped with snow. An eagle passes over the many\r\nsmall fishing boats docked for the night. Zoom in on the cliff face by the cruise\r\nship—it’s covered in graffiti. Scene fades back. I start to write.</em>\r\n\r\nTalking head shot: Me. What was going through my head when we did that first free write? Something along the lines of, “Wow! Here I had expected this class to just be tedious work, but it’s actually like creative writing! This is so cool! I’m actually going to enjoy this!” When the real assignments started, the research-loving child within me was awakened. I think I had forgotten just how much there was to learn that wasn’t taught in the classroom. Unfortunately, I was a little out of control. So many doors had been opened that I couldn’t resist trying to walk through all of them—whether that meant trying to fit in an analysis of every president’s use of public and hidden transcripts since Teddy Roosevelt in a paper on the 2004 Kerry-Bush election or wanting to discuss all the details of women’s roles in and attitudes toward society from World War II through the modern feminist movement, not to mention an analysis of the dichotomy of the treasured and admired and the reviled and feared in Othello, in a paper on the vilification of women in the 1950s; or [laughs] attempting to fit an analysis of all of modern alternative medicine techniques, a dissection of the medical-industrial complex, a discussion of the spiritual basis for the effectiveness of meditation, a chronicle of the evolution of spiritual healing practices, and an evaluation of plausible links between transcendent abilities and quantum physics, into a single research paper. Yeah, I know.\r\n\r\n<em>Scene shift: still 412 Pupin. The same students look decidedly more worn; they now\r\nsport winter coats and boots. The professor explains that they are to discuss their\r\nindividual writing processes with their partner —what works, what doesn’t work,\r\nwhat the constant trends are. Cut to close-up, Sara and me.</em>\r\n\r\n<em> Sara: And I pretty much always write my papers the night before they’re due. It’s\r\nlike I can’t possibly start before that. I’m not really sure why. I mean, some people\r\ndo that and they’re okay with it because it works for them. But it just makes me so\r\nstressed out, you know?</em>\r\n\r\nMe: I guess mine’s pretty similar. I definitely can’t write anything prior to the night\r\nbefore either. I think part of it might be perfectionism, you know, like if I wait until the last minute then it’ll be okay if I don’t do really well because, hey, I did it at the last minute. But if I start early, then I have to do well because I have plenty of time. I think another part of it is just my indecision. When we have these broad topics, and especially since we can choose whatever we’re interested in, I always find myself choosing something I’m very interested in, which makes it nearly impossible to choose just which tiny aspect of that I’ll turn into a paper, until the night-before  pressure kicks in. As for my writing process once I start the paper … I guess it’s pretty similar to what it was before we started having to do all those timed essays in high school. Yeah, it’s just like what you said, “I don’t write drafts; I write papers.” Somehow, when I know the work I’m doing is supposed to turn into a nice, organized paper, I just can’t write exploratorily. Whether I have a written outline or just one in my head, the things I write next have to come in a logical sequence or it doesn’t even occur to me to write them. By the time I’m two-thirds through, the little editor in me is preparing to link everything back to the beginning, tie up loose ends, and conclude.\r\n\r\n<em> New scene: Milstein reading room, Butler Library. The clock reads 4:00 a.m. A few\r\nstudents, their coffees in front of them, are still up working. One sleeps in an\r\narmchair with his sweatshirt hood pulled over his face. Zoom in on my desk, spread\r\nwith books on complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and faith-based\r\nhealing. A stack of highlighted articles are strewn about on the left of an open\r\nGateway notebook computer. I check a quotation, and continue writing.</em>\r\n\r\n<em></em>\r\nNarration: What I found in doing revisions of my first two papers, and in essentially rewriting my research paper, was that more information did not mean a better paper. Not only was it difficult to tie everything together, but some of the supplementary\r\ndiscussions detracted from my main argument. In the midst of a Butler all-nighter, I finally achieved the ability to cast aside what wasn’t needed and narrow my focus. Perhaps it was just because I was tired and couldn’t care anymore about all the extra things that had seemed so interesting, or perhaps I had truly mastered a skill; either way, it worked.\r\n<em>\r\nNew scene: I’m hiking in the mountains above Lake Tahoe, California. The sky is\r\ncloudless, the sun hasn’t yet quite reached its zenith. No cars can be heard, only the\r\ncrunch of gravel under my hiking boots, a creek off in the distance, and birds amidst\r\nthe pine and fir trees that shade the path. I reach a fork with four options. Signs\r\nindicate various lakes and reservoirs to be found in each direction. </em>\r\n\r\nNarration: When I began this college writing class, I discovered a world of endless\r\nopportunities. I could learn about anything, write about anything, and analyze in\r\nways that high school had never allowed. The vast library stacks from 114th to 171st\r\nwere mine for the conquering. But over the course of the semester, I had to learn\r\nsomething that had never been a problem when I was a little girl making PowerPoint presentations. I had to learn to prioritize—to pick an argument and write what was applicable—nothing more, nothing less. I found that while my well-sourced dissertations on everything under the sun might be interesting to me, the only way to write a good paper—one that is effective and worth reading—is to be focused. There may yet be time in my life to write about everything that interests me, just not in one paper.\r\n\r\n<em>Cue inspirational pop song. Looking at the four options, I choose the path second\r\nfrom the right, and press on.

(237, 5, '2011-12-19 06:58:09', '2011-12-19 06:58:09', 'For a twenty-three year old, Erika has had a life comparable to that of an eighty year old—she has danced to Ecuadorian flutes in fiestas, gone sailing in Singapore, and spent vacations visiting the Malaysian rain forest and Karen tribes in New Zealand. Yet for all the cultural knowledge Erika has gained by growing up in countries far away from her native New York, she lacks something few go through life without: a feeling of home. Erika was one of the young adults interviewed by David Pollock, a social anthropologist who studies third-culture kids, children who “have spent . . . at least part of their childhood in countries and cultures other than their own” (6). Erika has no single nationality but rather a “third nationalism”—she feels no real attachment to her birth nation, the United States, but has no legal ties to the country that captured her heart, Singapore. National attachment is the focus of Benedict Anderson’s book,<em> Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism</em>, in which he states that “nationalism, [a] cultural artifa[ct]”(4), arises from citizens'' common history and shared cultural markers, such as language, appearance, and ethnicity. For Erika, however, these represent the mechanisms that prevented her from establishing a connection with any country, leaving her displaced and nation-less.\r\n\r\nWhereas language can foster feelings of connection among citizens of a nation, in the case of third-culture kids such as Erika, language often prevents nationalist feelings from arising. Erika explains how language alienated her from her birth country, relating “how strange she had felt the first time her American cousins had asked her to go ‘cruising’ ” during her vacation-stay in her native New York. “She presumed they [had] meant some type of boat ride. . . . to her amazement, cruising . . . meant endless driving about town with no apparent purpose” (Pollock 11-12). Her inability to understand what her cousins had meant by “cruising” caused Erika to feel distance from her home country. As a result, Erika disassociated the United States, stating that “for her, ‘going home’ meant returning to Singapore at the end of summer” (Pollock 12). Erika thereby challenges Anderson’s argument that language is responsible for creating “horizontal comradeship,” (7) and that “the nation was conceived in language, not in blood” (145). In fact, it is language that distanced Erika from the citizens of her “imagined political community,” (6) breaking the connections she had to the country rather than forging them.\r\n\r\nJust as language can serve to exclude, so can appearance. After living most of her teenage years in Singapore, Erika had come to think of this country as her home, introducing herself to peers at her American university as being from there. Yet she was distressed when they replied, “ ‘Really? You don’t look like it’ ” (Pollock 12). She didn’t fit in with her American counterparts either, due to her foreign fashions, expressions, and gestures. It was not until she adjusted by taking on more American clothes and tastes that “others accepted her as one of them” (Pollock 12). Thus it seems that outward appearance is important in the determination of one’s nationality. However, even after Erika changed her clothing style enough for her peers to invite her into their community, she did not fully fit in. Erika continued to feel that Americans “couldn’t understand her world . . . [and that] she couldn’t understand theirs” (Pollock 13). While being outwardly recognized as American due to her Caucasian features and clothing, on the inside Erika didn’t feel American at all.\r\n\r\nMore telling than clothing, gestures, or accents, are skin color and racial features. While Erika associated herself with Singapore, upon a trip back to the country after college, Erika found out that she did not belong there either. Erika was distressed to find that as a young white woman she stood out from other Singaporeans. She came to the realization that “here, in the world she had always thought of as home . . . she was seen as a foreigner” (Pollock 16). Anderson posits that one''s ethnicity plays a big role in the formation of ties to fellow citizens. He gives the example of Javanese villagers, who “have always known that they are connected to people they have never seen,” aware that they have “indefinitely stretchable nets of kinship and clientship” (6). In other words, the fact that we will never get to see everyone in our community, and much less our country, does not prevent us from feeling connected to our fellow citizens based on our cultural and ethnic similarities. Erika’s foreign ethnicity, however, prevented these national ties from being fully formed.\r\n\r\nThus the country Erika legally belongs to does not feel like home and inspires no nationalist feelings, yet she has no ties with the country she chose to be hers—and even she had, she would still stand out from the population due to her skin color. No matter where Erika settles, she will always be a foreigner, preventing feelings of “horizontal comradeship” from arising and preventing her from developing any sense of nationalism. Anderson, however, argues that nationalist feelings form because of the immediate attachment between those who share a culture, language, or ethnic markers. He sees these feelings as inherent and natural, and argues that “in everything ‘natural’ there is something unchosen” (143). He compares the “disinterred [feelings of] love and solidarity” we have for our families to the feelings we have for our nations since we can’t choose either (144). Anderson even asserts that “everyone can, should, [and] will ‘have’ a nationality” (5). While this may be true for those who have remained in one nation for most if not all of their lives, Erika’s experience growing up in several nations troubles the concept of a “naturalized nationality.”\r\n\r\nErika’s lack of a definite nationalism shows that one is not born with roots to a country but rather with an ability to develop nationalist feelings. Erika’s attachment to Singapore is a demonstration of this, but it also reveals the pains and challenges that result from developing ties to a country other than one’s own. Indeed, if nationalism has “proved notoriously difficult to define” (Anderson 3), then Erika’s “third nationalism”—in which no relation is established with one’s birth country, and all relations to other countries are uncredentialed—is perhaps impossible to define. The belief held by Tom Nairn that “Nationalism . . . [is] as inescapable as neurosis” (qtd. in Anderson 5), may be correct after all; it might just be that Erika has no country to put her nationalism in and has to awkwardly carry it around without ever finding a place to place it. Confronted with no nation to call her own, Erika is left to ponder, “Where [is] home now?” (Pollock 12). Perhaps what she should ask is, “Will I ever have a sense of home?”\r\n\r\nThe experience of third culture kids is a difficult one, especially due to the lack of connection that these children feel for their home country, to which many return. In addition to the difficulty of forming bonds to countries to which one does not legally belong, they face living with a second-rate status compared to real citizens, and constantly worrying about when the next move will be. Benedict Anderson’s “natural nationalism” is hard to apply to such children, whose homes change so often that they are ultimately left with none. Yet while nationalism is not a naturalized feeling, it can, as Anderson states, be considered a creation of our environment that requires constant upkeep and reassurance from the threats that are imposed by such anomalies as third culture kids.', 'Nation-less: The Unnaturalness of Nationalism as Shown by Third-Culture Kids', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'nation-less-the-unnaturalness-of-nationalism-as-shown-by-third-culture-kids', '', '', '2012-03-23 15:33:17', '2012-03-23 15:33:17', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=237', 0, 'essay', '', 0),

We hear “war” and we think of massive green army tanks rolling over a sandy landscape in Iraq, blood-streaked victims of a suicide bombing in Israel, the barrel of a gun pointing out over a stone wall during the Civil War, or a phalanx of silver armor flooding across a hillside in the Trojan War. Ask a war veteran to imagine war, however, and he will conjure a narrower set of images: the bodies of fishermen and children strewn across a riverbank at dawn; the empty space where a friend used to stand a minute before a mine went off; or blood dripping on the back of one’s own hand after firing the first shot (Shay, Achilles in Vietnam 3, 71, 78).\r\n\r\nWhat distinguishes the images of war in the mind of a war veteran from those in the mind of an ordinary civilian is that the former are first-hand accounts. They have not been filtered through a camera lens or a reporter’s pen. According to essayist Susan Sontag, this discrepancy is immutable and insurmountable. She ends her essay “Looking at War,” a discussion of the evolution, importance, and complexity of war photography, with this very sentiment: “We don’t get it. We truly can’t imagine what it was like…That’s what every soldier, and every journalist and aid worker and independent observer who has put in time under fire…stubbornly feels. And they are right” (98). With her last lines, Sontag casts the rest of her essay in a critical, if not dubious, light. All the images of war she has spent so much time discussing—images that have occupied the global consciousness since the camera’s invention in 1839—are only that: images. They will never accurately render the disorienting, dehumanizing, and transformative experience of battle.\r\n\r\nSontag’s admission begs the question: If we are truly incapable of conceiving of the reality of war, what use are war images? Sontag suggests that one possible motivation behind a war image is to provoke the viewer to oppose war (97). But she points out that a narrative is likely to be more effective than an image in arousing protest. She explains: “Partly it is a question of the length of time one is obliged to look, and to feel. No photograph…can unfold, go further” (98). Narrative, it seems, has more potential than a photograph to recall war faithfully enough to arouse active opposition. And unlike a photograph, whose meaning can be altered based on the caption (Sontag sites a photograph of children killed in the shelling of a village that was passed around at both Serb and Croat propaganda briefings), a narrative’s meaning cannot be radically transformed by the addition of a footnote or an addendum (86). Narrative, it seems, offers a less-easily manipulated depiction of war that can prompt activism more effectively than an image.\r\n\r\nBut Sontag explains that unlike a narrative, a photograph is universal—it does not exclude its audience based on the language it uses or the references it makes (86). And, according to Sontag, not all narratives are more effective (or affecting) than photographs: she uses Homer’s epic poem the Iliad as an example of a war narrative that depicts battle in a steely, unfeeling fashion. In the Iliad, Sontag asserts, “War is seen as something men do, inveterately, undeterred by the accumulation of suffering it inflicts” (93). Like the two types of war photography, staged and un-staged, Sontag presents two families of war narratives: those that, like the Iliad, depict war in a glorified, unrealistic manner, and those that dutifully report the violence of battle to mobilize readers to oppose war. She designates only the latter category as one that can have a powerful, lasting effect on the reader.\r\n\r\nBut not all war narratives belong to these two categories. Upon closer inspection of a collection of war narratives—“The Charge of the Light Brigade” by Alfred Lord Tennyson, The Things They Carried by Tim O’Brien, and the Iliad, by Homer—it becomes clear that the narrative’s place in the pantheon of war depictions is as varied as the photographs Sontag presents. And while readers cannot interpret a narrative as disparately as the Serbs and Croats interpreted the photo of the dead children, the strength of the audience’s response can vary widely based on the identity of the reader. But what do these narratives really do for us? What is their purpose if, as Sontag argues, they can’t ever really put us in the soldier’s boots?\r\n\r\nIt is an undeniable fact that certain war narratives glorify rather than accurately reflect the realities of war. Alfred Lord Tennyson’s “The Charge of the Light Brigade” is one such poem. It memorializes a particularly bloody battle during the Crimean War, in which six-hundred British soldiers were ambushed on the plain above Balaklava, a town in Crimea. Tennyson’s description of the men marching en masse to defend their country depicts a grand, cinematic version of the battle. He writes: “When can their glory fade?/ O the wild charge they made!/ … /‘Charge for the guns!’ he said:/ Into the valley of death/ rode the six hundred” (1). Tennyson’s poem paints the soldiers riding “into the valley of death” as glorious men nobly sacrificing their lives.\r\n\r\nThis line from Tennyson’s poem became the title for one of Roger Fenton’s most famous photographs of the Crimean War, entitled “Into the Valley of Death.” In the photograph, which Sontag discusses in her essay, Fenton captures a wide, rutted road that holds the remnants of the bloody battle, littered with cannonballs and rocks. In stark contrast to most of Fenton’s distinctly staged photographs, Sontag describes this image as a portrait “of absence, without the dead” (92). She explains that this portrait is the only one that would not have needed to be staged—it displays no more, and no less, than a void:\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_344" align="alignright" width="378" caption="E3_Halperin_clip_image003"]<img class="size-full wp-image-344 " title="E3_Halperin_clip_image003" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/E3_Halperin_clip_image003.gif" alt="E3_Halperin_clip_image003" width="378" height="244" />[/caption]\r\n\r\nTennyson’s poem, on the other hand, is characterized not by absence, but rather by the presence of six-hundred soldiers marching to their deaths. He evokes the same panorama of destruction that Fenton’s photo memorializes, but in a more melodious fashion. While Fenton’s photograph captures the results of the destruction—the emptiness, the lost lives, the cannonballs—Tennyson’s poem depicts the march to destruction, and the battle itself: “Cannon to the right of them/ Cannon to the left of them/ Cannon in front of them/ Volley’d and thunder’d” (1). The rhyme and meter of the poem make it lyrical, which presents a strange contrast with the dark subject of the poem. It is interesting that Fenton would chose such a contrived, heavy-handed poem to entitle a photograph that is considered (at least by Sontag) to be one of the few emotionally affecting portraits of his career. Indeed, after reading the flowery poem, one would think that it belongs to Sontag’s first category of war narratives: the glorified, unrealistic depiction of war.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Fenton used a line from Tennyson’s poem to title his photograph, however, means that the poem did hold some significance at the time (if only for the artist himself). Although a contemporary audience might read the poem as a tired, flat memorial, when it was first published in 1854, readers felt it was a fitting tribute to the lost troops. Indeed, Tennyson wrote “Charge of the Light Brigade” immediately after reading an account of the battle in the paper. The poem became extremely popular, and was even distributed in pamphlets among the troops in Crimea (Shannon, 22). Despite what Sontag might think, it seems war narrative is not exclusively useful to provoke impassioned opposition. With careful word choice and elegiac form, narrative can also become a fitting memorial. Tennyson’s poem shows us that war narrative, like war photography, is an art whose meaning constantly shifts and changes with time and audience.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that war narrative is not merely, as Sontag suggests, useful as a rallying cry; it can also be a requiem for lost troops. This incarnation of war narrative must understandably distort the event it elegizes, because it is written to honor and flatter the soldiers who died. (Tennyson even changed the name of the squadron from “the Light Calvary Brigade” to “the Light Brigade” to make it more compact and rhythmic (Shannon, 13).) But while this kind of war narrative challenges Sontag’s view of the optimum purpose of a war narrative—to provoke outrage—it unwittingly supports her view of the abiding efficacy (or lack thereof) of these kinds of presentations of war. In glorifying these events, we in no way gain a sense of what it must actually have been like to be there. The line “Honor the brave and bold!/ Long shall the tale be told” (Tennyson 1) isn’t so much a glimpse into a battleground as much as it is a eulogy. Like Fenton, who often distorted the landscape in order to take a powerful photograph, Tennyson romanticizes and elegizes the famous Crimean battle to achieve his ends. But what if a writer’s aim is to achieve what Sontag believes is impossible—to capture, for a reader who has never been in a war zone, what the world under fire is like?\r\n\r\nTim O’Brien attempts this very feat in his collection of short stories, The Things They Carried, about a platoon of soldiers in the Vietnam War. The stories, told from the perspective of a narrator also named Tim O’Brien, describe the earth-shattering and bizarre life in a war zone and provide glimpses into the broken lives of the soldiers who survived the war. In “Good Form,” O’Brien distinguishes between “story-truth” and “happening-truth.” A “story truth” may not have technically occurred exactly as it is described, but is more faithful to the overall experience than a “happening truth,” which occurred in objective reality. He explains: “I want you to feel what I felt. I want you to know why story-truth is truer sometimes than happening-truth” (179). Both Tennyson and O’Brien distort the objective truth in their depictions of war, but for different reasons: Tennyson, to honor the lost soldiers, and O’Brien, to honor what he believes to be the essence of his experience.\r\n\r\nIndeed, O’Brien attempts to describe the turmoil going on inside of him by telling stories about the experience that caused it. O’Brien provides an example of a happening-truth: “I was once a soldier. There were many bodies, real bodies with real faces, but I was young then and I was afraid to look. And now, twenty years later, I’m left with faceless responsibility and faceless grief” (180). He juxtaposes this testimony with a story-truth: “He was a slim, dead, almost dainty young man of about twenty. He lay in the center of a red clay trail near the village of My Khe. His jaw was in his throat. His one eye was shut, the other eye was a star-shaped hole. I killed him” (180). With story-truth, O’Brien can give a face to the “faceless responsibility” and “faceless grief” he feels. Story-truth can, in O’Brien’s words, “make things present” (180). The nagging feeling in the pit of his stomach twenty years after the war is over can be realized on the page as a “slim, dead, almost dainty young man of about twenty.” Story truths, surprisingly more vivid than happening-truths, do not contain happening truths’ uncertainty of things unseen. They give faces, names, and places to tenebrous memories.\r\n\r\nStory-truths depict war very differently from a staged or a candid war photograph. These stories neither glorify war nor offer the methodical, painstakingly accurate depiction of violence that Sontag sites as a testimony to the power of narrative (98). Instead, O’Brien attempts to combine the control of a staged war photo with the emotional charge of a candid one. Sontag notes that the Vietnam War marked the end of staged war photography (93). It seems O’Brien inherited the legacy of the “lost art.” He renders his experiences as he thinks they should be seen, not as he saw them.\r\n\r\nO’Brien certainly challenges Sontag’s claim that it is impossible to give civilians a sense of what being in a war zone is actually like. But it is difficult, if not impossible, to determine whether or not he achieved his goal. Readers cannot go back in time and find themselves in the midst of battle to see if they would share O’Brien’s impressions. But O’Brien’s stories can be seen as an antidote to a particular problem Sontag has with war photography: “The problem…is that people remember only the photographs. This remembering through photographs eclipses other forms of understanding—and remembering” (Sontag 94). O’Brien’s stories enable a reader thinking about war to conjure up more than an out-of-context image. The reader can recall, as soldiers do, snippets of a larger story that are rooted in complex turmoil and emotion.\r\n\r\nBoth “The Charge of the Light Brigade” and The Things They Carried challenge Sontag’s limited definition of a war narrative and pose answers to the question of what a war narrative can do for the reader. It can not only provoke opposition, as Sontag argues, but also can act as a memorial, and even venture to give readers a sense of what war is like. But what about the works that Sontag dismisses as unrealistic depictions of war, like the Iliad? If we have found prose and poetry that challenge Sontag’s original characterizations of war narratives, might it be possible to see beyond Sontag’s confining definition of the Iliad as a depiction of war that is devoid of emotion?\r\n\r\nSontag argues that the Iliad callously presents war as a fact of life: “Descriptions of the exact fashion in which bodies are injured and killed in combat is a recurring climax in the stories told in the Iliad. War is seen as something men do, inveterately, undeterred by the accumulation of suffering it inflicts; to represent war in words or pictures requires a keen, unflinching detachment” (93). She explains that this view of war—as inveterate, inevitable, and even normal—is a product of the epoch in which Homer wrote the Iliad. She explains that, in stark contrast to contemporary belief that “war is an aberration,” the Iliad reflects a time at which “war has been the norm and peace the exception” (93). Homer’s world exists in a continual state of combat, and seems far removed from contemporary America, in which wars involve a select few instead of entire nations and empires. Indeed, the idea of battle as a way of life seems not only archaic but also unrealistic, considering the large number of war veterans suffering from severe Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. (Without even mentioning the ever-increasing number of Iraq War veterans suffering from the disease, a quarter-million of the three-quarters-of-a-million combat veterans from Vietnam are still living with severe PTSD [Shay, xix].) According to Sontag, the Iliad depicts war as ubiquitous, but this view of war is unrealistic, because war ravages a nation so thoroughly that the populace of a prosperous country could not maintain a perpetual state of war. Sontag sees the Iliad as a chronicle of a type warfare that does not, and cannot, resemble our own.\r\n\r\nBut some see the Iliad—the story of warrior Achilles’ anger in the Trojan War—not as an unrealistic depiction of war, but rather an extremely astute chronicle of a PTSD victim. Psychologist Jonathan Shay won a Macarthur Fellowship for his work treating PTSD in Vietnam War veterans using Homer’s the Iliad and the Odyssey. In the introduction to his book, Achilles in Vietnam: Combat Trauma and the Undoing of Character, he explains how that the story of the Iliad was actually similar to that of many Vietnam War veterans:\r\n\r\nAchilles…is tortured by guilt and the conviction that he should have died rather than his friend; he renounces all desire to return home alive; he goes berserk and commits atrocities against the living and the dead. This is the story of Achilles in the Iliad, not some metaphoric translation of it.\r\nThis was also the story of many combat veterans, both from Vietnam and from other long wars…I have brought them together with the Iliad not to tame, appropriate, or co-opt them but to promote a deeper understanding of both, increasing the reader’s capacity to be disturbed by the Iliad rather than softening the blow of the veterans’ stories. (Shay xxi)\r\n\r\nIn contrast to Sontag, Shay sees the Iliad not as an unflinching, unfeeling depiction of battle, but rather as an accurate chronicle of the emotional turmoil of a soldier in wartime. Reading the Iliad helped him better understand—and therefore, better treat—Vietnam War veterans. By adding that he hopes the juxtaposition of the soldiers’ stories with the Iliad will increase the readers’ sensitivity to the epic poem, Shay implies that the emotional potency of the poem might be hard for modern readers to access. This implication sheds new light on Sontag’s statement that the Iliad presents war as “inveterate” rather than exceptional or life shattering. It is possible that Sontag misread Homer’s dutiful descriptions of Achilles’ breakdown as detached, when they were, in fact, careful chronicles of a man losing his mind.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it seems hard to imagine that Sontag could read Homer’s description of Achilles’ treatment of his rival Hektor’s corpse as “unfeeling.” Blinded by grief and rage, Achilles violently abuses the body of Hektor, the Trojan general who murdered Achilles’ best friend Patroklos. The brutality of his actions is certainly vividly rendered, but the emotion behind it is apparent:\r\n\r\n…at that hour he [Achilles] yoked his team, with Hektor\r\ntied behind, to drag him out, three times\r\naround Patroklos’ tomb…Akhilleus\r\nin rage visited indignity on Hektor\r\nday after day.\r\n(Homer 24:16)\r\n\r\nThis description honors Achilles’ grief in the wake of his best friend’s death by revealing his inability to cope. Homer depicts Achilles dragging Hektor’s body around Patroklos’ tomb three times and abusing Hektor’s body “day after day.” As Shay points out, particularly traumatic events, such as betrayal by a leader, death of a friend in arms, or being wounded often leave a soldier at risk of entering a “berserk” state, one of unnecessary and uncontrolled violence. Shay characterizes Achilles—who has suffered all of these events—as “berserk” at this point in the poem.\r\n\r\nBut the berserk state is not exclusively a product of the Trojan War: a Vietnam veteran’s description of his own abuse of a dead victim, included in Shay’s book, could just as easily be read as Achilles’ internal monologue. He says: “I lost all my mercy. I felt a drastic change after that. I just couldn’t get enough. I built up such hate, I couldn’t do enough damage… [It] made some of the hurt go away” (78). It seems that Achilles is not merely a bloodthirsty warrior; like many soldiers, he is so overcome with emotion that he loses touch with the material world around him.\r\n\r\nParallels between Achilles’ narrative and O’Brien’s narrative further challenge Sontag’s characterization of the Iliad as an unfeeling report of the Trojan War. In “How to Tell a True War Story,” O’Brien describes his comrade Rat Kiley brutally murdering a baby water buffalo after the death of his best friend, Kurt Lemon. Like Achilles, and many war veterans Shay describes, Rat Kiley goes berserk in the wake of his best friend’s death. O’Brien describes the scene: “Rat took careful aim and shot off an ear….It wasn’t to kill; it was to hurt…[Rat] shot randomly, almost casually, quick little spurts in the belly and butt. Then he reloaded, squatted down, and shot it in the left front knee” (79). O’Brien, like Homer, describes with languishing detail the violent acts of soldiers in mourning. Both men brutally attack defenseless victims to displace the rage they feel in the wake of the loss of their best friend: Achilles abuses a corpse, and Rat, a baby buffalo. Both men also find it difficult to stop abusing the vulnerable victim. Interestingly, both soldiers’ desperate desire for control leads them to abuse defenseless victims. Their testimonies help us begin to comprehend how and why war crimes are committed. The close parallels between the two narratives also shed light on Homer’s epic. Like O’Brien, Homer so vividly describes his character’s horrifying actions to impress upon the reader how unhinged and nearly inhuman war can make a person. His poetry is not, as Sontag seems to think, a testament to the normalcy of war. Quite the contrary: in fact, it is intended to display the extent to which war can remove a solider from both morality and reality.\r\n\r\nThroughout her essay, Sontag looks exclusively at the way in which war photographs have affected viewers unconnected with war. It is not until the end of her essay that she ties in the view of the solider, stubbornly maintaining that the everyday civilian cannot understand what it’s like to be in a war zone. But war narratives do not only serve the non-soldier. Unlike photographs, which are taken largely to document events for those who are not present, narratives can be employed in therapy for war veterans. O’Brien explains how his own writings helped him deal with his war experiences: “The act of writing had led me through a swirl of memories that might otherwise have ended in paralysis or worse” (156). It seems that O’Brien’s embrace of “story-truth” is inextricably linked to the efficacy of his narratives. Through story truth, he explains, “I can attach faces to grief and love and pity and God…I can make myself feel again” (180). Sontag argues that war narratives are incapable of making us feel what war is like. But she leaves out the fact that war narratives can allow soldiers, hardened and withdrawn after the ravages of violence, to feel (something, anything) again.\r\n\r\nIn his descriptions of his own writing, O’Brien links his ability to remember with his ability to feel again. And O’Brien is not the only war veteran who had difficulty accessing not only emotions but also memories. Amnesia is common in the wake of traumatic events (Shay 172). And as Shay explains, narrative plays a substantial role in the healing (and re-remembering) process for war veterans: “Virtually all treatment methods direct the survivor to construct a personal narrative at some time in his or her recovery” (187). Shay explains that the construction of narrative is often difficult for veterans because sequential time is antithetical to the disorienting experience of battle. His description of the individual fragments that compose a trauma narrative recalls O’Brien’s description of “story-truth”:\r\n\r\nWe see the paradox that narrative temporality can never be completely true to the timeless experience of prolonged, severe trauma…The paradox disappears when we look at narration as a step in the survivor’s larger move to communalize the trauma by inducing others who were not there to feel what the victim felt when he or she was going through it (Shay 191).\r\n\r\nShay connects the two different audiences of war narrative — those who were there, and say we could never understand, and those who want nothing more than to understand. It seems the two parties are inextricably linked. In order to truly recover, a soldier must relay his experiences to a sympathetic audience. Depictions of war, then, can serve at least two audiences: those on the home front and those behind enemy lines. It also seems that war narratives can serve multiple purposes: they can memorialize and elegize soldiers; they can open one’s eyes to the horror of war; and they can also allow those who know war all too well to close their eyes and move on with their lives.\r\n\r\nWhen Sontag claims that depictions of war are in some way futile because we—those who have never seen war—just “couldn’t get it,” she seems to have missed the point. As Tennyson’s poem displays, war narratives are not exclusively written to provide an accurate account of a battle. In fact, “accuracy” in war narrative is barely relevant at all. Shay displays that the writer’s ability to capture war with emotional acuity, as O’Brien and Homer do, is what enables the soldier and the civilian to better understand each other. The soldier remembers how to feel, and the civilian gains some semblance of understanding the soldier’s experiences. The war photograph gives the viewer a false sense of certainty; having seen a photograph, we are bound to think we have a sense of the milieu the image captures. The war narrative, at its most effective, has the opposite effect. It shows the reader just enough of the horrors of war to make him or her understand what soldiers must wrestle with daily—the utter incomprehensibility of it all. ', 'Can the Pen Match the Sword?: A Look at the Value of Words in the Depiction of War', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'template-title', '', '', '2012-04-10 16:02:50', '2012-04-10 16:02:50', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=239', 0, 'essay', '', 0);

I whirled around, nearly stumbling over myself, to see where the remark came from. A disheveled man had paused hunched over on the sidewalk, with an assortment of plastic bags in his hands. He stared at me\r\nwith bewilderment and distaste on his face, like he had crossed paths with something alien.\r\n\r\nI went on, silent.\r\n\r\nI normally do not notice my race. Only when I look in the mirror, when I receive an unprovoked taunt when I go running, or when I stumble on a multi-syllabic word, do I suddenly remember that I was not raised here, that I am neither black nor white. I am\r\nyellow. And to be yellow is to be incapable of talking about race; it is to passively allow my own categorization into the broadest catch-all grouping on affirmative action surveys: “Asian.”\r\n\r\nRichard Rodriguez, author of Brown: The Last Discovery of America, knows about the awkwardness of my situation. As Rodriguez writes in a chapter entitled “The Third Man,” being caught with a skin color between black and white means being caught outside “the tragic dialectic of America, the black and white conversation” (126). In his essay, Rodriguez is sitting between a black academic and a white journalist, both of whom are making generalizations about race relations in America. Being in the gray area means enduring the assumption that all Latinos and Asians—or, to use a recently popular term, immigrants—face the same challenges in the United States, when in truth the common issue we face is silence—silence that springs from a fear of talking about race, and from a belief that such talk is unnecessary.\r\n\r\nI remember my first day of school the year I returned to the United States from Taiwan. I had just received my schedule and was wandering around the foreign-looking hallways, entirely lost. I was immediately directed to the ESL teacher, who was also a\r\ncaretaker for overseas students. I thanked her, in rusty English, for her offer of assistance. But I never returned to that room again. I had left home to be challenged, to have no retreat, and I did not want the shelter of silence afforded the kids in that room. I wanted neither delicate treatment nor extra time on exams.\r\n\r\nThe East Asian immigrant’s narrative is one of silence. East Asians do not like to talk about race; we seek no conflict and remain constantly considerate of others. Though these are racial stereotypes in themselves, our hesitation to speak out is evident: as a race, we are less politically active and outspoken on racial issues than other groups. Race is a foreign construct to us—one we believe almost superfluous.\r\n\r\nThat is why I desired a clear-cut, accent-free affiliation with English just as Rodriguez did in his youth, perhaps out of the same fear of linguistic grayness—the fear of having no native tongue. It did not take me long to realize that language is the basis of race. The reason that broad lifestyle differences exist between races is that disparate languages dictate different modes of thinking.\r\n\r\nRacial identity is difficult to address because race is easily lost in translation. As Rodriguez points out, there are dozens of words to describe Hispanic skin color, few of which can be fully translated into English. Likewise, English fails to describe the complex familial ties and names of relatives in extended families that are integral to Chinese racial identity. And when concepts about our identity are lost along with the words, ambiguity about our racial identity ensues.\r\n\r\nIn last year’s No Child Left Behind report for my school district, a bar chart conveniently grouped Asian Americans and whites in one column. The authors of the report reserved their precision for other minorities. The problem with race in the United States is not just demographic or geographic. It is about taking care to use precise terms. In “The Third Man,” the African-American professor gets on stage and “refers (in one breath) to ‘Blacks and Latinos,’ his synonym for the disadvantaged in America” (126). As Rodriguez points out, only by tearing down the racial dichotomy in America, by recognizing the “third” man— the brown, the yellow, and all the colors beyond—can we distinguish between and talk more intelligently about culture, heritage, and blood, and recognize that these designations exist independently of race.\r\n\r\nDespite what my school district thinks, I, at least, know that I am not white. I have Taiwanese blood, though many would claim that it is no different from Chinese blood. In terms of race, I would happily surrender to either category, but most surveys settle simply for the ambiguous term “Asian.” Even the bum on the street knew more about my nationality. If “[r]ace is America’s theme—not freedom, not democracy (as we say in company)” (Rodriguez 136), then why are we so careless with our language when addressing race, compared to our diction in discussing national ideals? Could it be that the English language lacks the complexity needed to describe my race?\r\n\r\nOne problem with affirmative action is that it is hampered by politically correct language. Experts on race fear they will offend broad groups if they distinguish between suburban black families and inner-city black families, between first-generation immigrant Chinese and Chinese who don’t actually speak Chinese. These distinctions are personal and they rely on assumptions, but they are necessary for even broader distinctions of race to be meaningful. Yet, it is out of a concern for decency that affirmative action becomes a dichromatic system splitting the population into two broad groups: the Fortunate and the Unfortunate, demarcated by skin color. Such polarization benefits few minorities, because no one willingly accepts the “Unfortunate” label. As Rodriguez points out: “Not so long ago, Hispanics, particularly Mexicans and Cubans, resisted the label of ‘minority.’ … I remember my young Mexican mother saying to her children, in Spanish, ‘We are not minorities’” (126).\r\n\r\nOf income, education, ability, age, culture, upbringing, geographic ties, and all of the characteristics by which we determine a person’s circumstances, skin color is the most visible, but it is also the least indicative of a person’s capacities. If we are committed to healing the racial scars in our nation’s history, why do we continue to use race—a construct that inflicted such wounds in the first place—so widely in decisions we make in education and the job market? Why do we try to use the term so ubiquitously in affirmative action when it is so bogged down by political correctness and so devoid of linguistic precision?\r\n\r\nI have a residential advisor, Nicholas, who is from Ecuador and speaks English with a Spanish accent. He shocked me the day I moved in by greeting me in flawless, unaccented Mandarin Chinese. What race is he, then, according to my language-isidentity model? What race am I, now that I write better in English but speak more fluently in Mandarin, that I alternate between two languages when I talk to my siblings, that my inner monologue is conducted in English, but that I automatically switch to Chinese whenever I count and do math? Does it mean that I belong to neither race? Can I acquire a new race the same way Nicholas and I have acquired new languages, new modes of thinking? Could I “lose” it in the same way Rodriguez tried to rid himself of his Hispanic identity by refusing to use Spanish?\r\n\r\nMight a pedestrian in the street care about what I have to say and be able to see me for more than my skin color?\r\n\r\nBy stepping back and viewing race not as something that envelops us but instead as something beyond us, we can begin to see the details of the identities into which we are unwittingly born.

(241, 5, '2011-12-19 07:13:16', '2011-12-19 07:13:16', 'When photographer Hans Namuth visited Jackson Pollock’s studio to document his painting process, he arrived to find Pollock standing over a massive wet canvas lying across the floor. At the time, Pollock was a leading artist in the abstract expressionist movement, a post-World War II style in which artists often used non-representational forms to convey emotional intensity. Pollock had promised to start a new painting for the photo session but had finished before Namuth arrived. As they were standing there, however, Pollock suddenly picked up his brush again, as if sensing the painting was still incomplete. For the next half an hour, Namuth watched through the lens of his camera as Pollock threw, flung, and dripped paint in a rhythmic trance before pronouncing the painting done. Awed, Namuth later reflected upon the significance of Pollock’s work, noting how he had “managed to free line not only from its function of representing objects in the world, but also from its task of describing or bounding shapes or figures, whether abstract or representational” (Karmel 132). Art critic Harold Rosenberg agreed with Namuth, describing the style as a “gesture of liberation from value—political, aesthetic, moral” (Rosenberg 22).\r\n\r\nBut what does the viewer contemplating One: Number 31, 1950 at the Museum of Modern Art see? Standing in front of a canvas that is nearly nine by eighteen feet, covered with a splattering of different colored paints any three year old could do, does he see the same meaning, the same significance? And why has Pollock’s work, or the work of the abstract expressionists in general, been so successful when it is simultaneously so simplistic and so indefinable? One set of possible answers to these questions can be found in the realm of science. The recognition Pollock’s paintings have achieved can be explained by the theory of memes proposed by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins. The field of memetics, an application of the evolutionary concepts behind genetics, studies the transfer of ideas from person to person and what makes a meme, or a particular idea, successful (Dawkins 192). As compared to a conversation between two people, in which ideas are normally conveyed clearly and directly, a painting is an indirect form of communication that requires more interpretation to understand. Dawkins’ theory allows for a new level of understanding of abstract impressionists like Pollock.\r\n\r\nAbstract expressionists employ a means of communication where the idea expressed is not always abundantly clear and the merit of the technical skill demonstrated is debatable. Even so, the style achieved a high status in accordance with the characteristics defined by Dawkins as crucial to a meme’s success (and, not coincidentally, to a gene’s success). The first quality is longevity: the ability to persist through time (Dawkins 194). Just like Dawkins’ example of a certain tune surviving in written form and in peoples’ minds, so too are the works of Pollock ensured longevity (Dawkins 194). In addition to his actual paintings hanging in art museums around the world, the number of people who have at least a basic concept of Pollock’s work greatly exceeds the number of people who have actually seen one of his paintings in real life. The most novice art student has at least an elementary knowledge of Pollock’s style, and many members of non-artistic circles are familiar with his paintings due to their cultural presence. The physical and conceptual persistence of Pollock’s work, even decades after the artist’s death, proves the unlikelihood of its “dying out” as long as art continues to hold its traditional level of importance in the individual and cultural realms.\r\n\r\nIn addition to longevity, Dawkins proposes fecundity, or the ability to propagate and spread, as critical to a meme’s survival; drawing a parallel to genes, memes are described as replication machines whose level of success is determined by how well they can reproduce themselves (Dawkins 194). An extremely literal interpretation of this principle can be applied to the work of Pollock, since countless replications of his paintings exist. The sense of the evolutionary impulse present in much of Dawkins’ case studies comes across here since the spread of a meme is directly related to its sense of worth or value for those receiving it. For example, Dawkins proposes that for a scientific meme, “its spread will depend on how acceptable it is to the population of individual scientists” (Dawkins 194). Taking this into consideration, the far-reaching presence of Pollock’s work in both artistic and non-artistic circles serves as direct testimony to a positive reception of his paintings. The doubting critic, perhaps a fan of classical art, must recognize that Pollock’s work has at least a certain degree of success solely based on the popularity his work has achieved.\r\n\r\nLongevity and fecundity aside, the most interesting application of memetics to abstract expressionism lies in the final quality of a successful meme: copying-fidelity (Dawkins 194). On this point, Dawkins himself is rather ambiguous, stretching his definition of the term in order to make it work. In the field of genetics, copying-fidelity is the ability of a gene to replicate itself accurately, thus ensuring its own perpetuation instead of any variation (Dawkins 17). In the field of memetics, this idea does not seem to translate, since the transfer of an idea from person to person alters its definition based on each individual perception and interpretation. Dawkins eventually reconciles this with the assertion that “differences in the ways that people represent [the meme] are then, by definition, not part of the meme” (Dawkins 196). This explanation, however, does not seem fully sufficient. In order to explore the validity of copying-fidelity to memes, it is necessary to temporarily ignore a strict adherence to the gene-meme analogy. While similarities abound, genes and memes do in fact differ greatly in their natures. Genes are essentially assigned and limited to the individual; memes, on the other hand, have a greater element of choice and by definition concern the interaction between people. Allowing for this difference, a reflection on the success of abstract expressionism offers a new alternative to the quality of copying-fidelity: adaptability.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary for abstract expressionism to have an element of adaptability. Standing in front of One: Number 31, 1950, it is difficult to know precisely what Pollock had in mind when he was painting—what idea he was trying to express. As the painting represents nothing distinguishable, it leaves itself open to any interpretation. Within it, some people see the “nervous intensity of the modern city” while others perceive the “primal rhythms of nature” (“One: Number 31, 1950”). With this artist-viewer interaction in mind, it is reasonable to ask if a painting is successful if the viewer has a different interpretation than the one intended by the artist. The answer in the affirmative provides adaptability as a key to success. For Pollock, the act of creation was sufficient unto itself. As an action painter, he was concerned with the actual process of painting, the play between what he could control and what he could not, and the relationship that unfolded between the artist and what he built upon the canvas (Rosenberg 22). As such, the intrinsic meaning of the painting essentially lies in its interpretation—what the viewer can get out of it on a personal level. With this logic, the greater potential a painting has for multiple interpretations, the greater potential it has for meaning.\r\n\r\nBringing this concept back to the field of memetics, the quality of copying-fidelity is no longer appropriate as an attribute of success. In the world of art, copying-fidelity would be comparable to a single interpretation of a painting. This form of accuracy would thus limit the painting’s accessibility to viewers, as there is practically no concept to which everyone can relate. Alternatively, a certain degree of adaptability leaves the opportunity for everyone to find something they like. A meme need no longer be only a replication machine; now, it should serve the dual purpose of being an adaptation machine. Accuracy becomes secondary to flexibility, perfection secondary to reflection. A meme able to adapt to a wide variety of people and mindsets holds a higher chance of survival. This new tool additionally reflects back on the original quality of longevity: adaptation ensures the capacity for evolutionary modernization, thus preventing a meme from becoming antiquated. As long as a meme offers multiple interpretations, each generation can find a new and appropriate understanding of it, ensuring its longevity. While adaptations in genetics are detrimental to an individual gene’s survival, adaptations in memetics appear to be a tool much more useful than copying-fidelity. In this way, Dawkins’ theory can be modified based on the success associated with the idea of adaptability in the world of abstract expressionism.\r\nFor the most skeptical of critics, the application of Dawkins’ quality for a successful meme to the artist-viewer relationship may not be enough to explain to him why abstract expressionism has garnered its level of popularity and acclaim. What may enlighten him, however, is a secondary level of memetics that extends to the interaction among artist, viewer, and society. When considering the success of the abstract expressionist movement, it is important to ask not only why Pollock was successful, but why he was successful beyond other abstract expressionists. In an extremely subjective style, why does the unassuming viewer find Pollock’s work superior to the work of any similar, lesser-known artist? It is perhaps because a sense of its worth or value is conveyed on a memetic level beyond the communication of the painting itself.\r\n\r\nOnce again, consider the man standing in front of One: Number 31, 1950. Not only is he forming his own interpretation of the piece, but he is subconsciously processing the external opinion that the painting has merit. He knows well-versed art critics have viewed the work before him and pronounced it valid and meaningful; the mere fact that the painting is hanging in a world-renowned museum must mean it has significance. In this manner, the collective of “society” propagates the meme that the painting is good, which in turn influences how the viewer receives the meme communication from the artist and the painting itself. The result is a highly interactive and complex system in which memetics function. A new importance arises for the memes of memes, the societal concepts inextricably attached to any given idea or theory. Such a development reintroduces the evolutionary practice of competition that underlies Dawkins’ studies. In order for one meme to rise above another, it is beneficial for it to have, in additional to its own merit, an external sense of worth, just as Pollock’s art has attained its level of fame as much from the societal sense that it is high-quality art as from its actual artistic value. In the world of art as in the world of memes, communication is not a two-way interaction but rather a perpetual exchange between various sources expressing and modifying each other.\r\n\r\nThe subject of great dispute, abstract expressionism has secured a place in art history despite heavy criticism. Often, viewers feel alienated by the seemingly random and meaningless images lying before them, and, walking through a modern art museum, one can often hear, “I could have done that,” quietly muttered. Be that as it may, abstract expressionists like Pollock have achieved great levels of success, sometimes to the bewilderment of non-artists and artists alike. Applying Dawkins’ theory of memetics to the style, however, offers a rational and practical examination of what aspects caused abstract expressionism to flourish and why it functions as a thriving artistic movement. While art will always evoke varying opinions of merit, approaching abstract expressionism from the scientific perspective of memetics can provide an understanding if not an appreciation of the presence of artists like Pollock in the unfolding history of artistic expression. ', 'The Memetics of Jackson Pollock', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'the-memetics-of-jackson-pollock', '', '', '2012-02-27 15:03:55', '2012-02-27 15:03:55', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=241', 0, 'essay', '', 0),

I whirled around, nearly stumbling over\r\nmyself, to see where the remark came from. A disheveled man had paused hunched\r\nover on the sidewalk, with an assortment of plastic bags in his hands. He stared at me\r\nwith bewilderment and distaste on his face, like he had crossed paths with something\r\nalien.\r\n\r\nI went on, silent.\r\n\r\nI normally do not notice my race. Only when I look in the mirror, when I receive\r\nan unprovoked taunt when I go running, or when I stumble on a multi-syllabic word, do\r\nI suddenly remember that I was not raised here, that I am neither black nor white. I am\r\nyellow. And to be yellow is to be incapable of talking about race; it is to passively allow\r\nmy own categorization into the broadest catch-all grouping on affirmative action\r\nsurveys: “Asian.”\r\n\r\nRichard Rodriguez, author of Brown: The Last Discovery of America, knows\r\nabout the awkwardness of my situation. As Rodriguez writes in a chapter entitled “The\r\nThird Man,” being caught with a skin color between black and white means being\r\ncaught outside “the tragic dialectic of America, the black and white conversation” (126).\r\nIn his essay, Rodriguez is sitting between a black academic and a white journalist, both\r\nof whom are making generalizations about race relations in America. Being in the gray\r\narea means enduring the assumption that all Latinos and Asians—or, to use a recently\r\npopular term, immigrants—face the same challenges in the United States, when in truth\r\nthe common issue we face is silence—silence that springs from a fear of talking about\r\nrace, and from a belief that such talk is unnecessary.\r\n\r\nI remember my first day of school the year I returned to the United States from\r\nTaiwan. I had just received my schedule and was wandering around the foreign-looking\r\nhallways, entirely lost. I was immediately directed to the ESL teacher, who was also a\r\ncaretaker for overseas students. I thanked her, in rusty English, for her offer of\r\nassistance. But I never returned to that room again. I had left home to be challenged, to have no retreat, and I did not want the shelter of silence afforded the kids in that room. I wanted neither delicate treatment nor extra time on exams.\r\n\r\nThe East Asian immigrant’s narrative is one of silence. East Asians do not like\r\nto talk about race; we seek no conflict and remain constantly considerate of others.\r\nThough these are racial stereotypes in themselves, our hesitation to speak out is evident: as a race, we are less politically active and outspoken on racial issues than other groups. Race is a foreign construct to us—one we believe almost superfluous.\r\n\r\nThat is why I desired a clear-cut, accent-free affiliation with English just as Rodriguez did in his youth, perhaps out of the same fear of linguistic grayness—the fear\r\nof having no native tongue. It did not take me long to realize that language is the basis\r\nof race. The reason that broad lifestyle differences exist between races is that disparate\r\nlanguages dictate different modes of thinking.\r\n\r\nRacial identity is difficult to address because race is easily lost in translation. As\r\nRodriguez points out, there are dozens of words to describe Hispanic skin color, few of\r\nwhich can be fully translated into English. Likewise, English fails to describe the\r\ncomplex familial ties and names of relatives in extended families that are integral to\r\nChinese racial identity. And when concepts about our identity are lost along with the\r\nwords, ambiguity about our racial identity ensues.\r\n\r\nIn last year’s No Child Left Behind report for my school district, a bar chart\r\nconveniently grouped Asian Americans and whites in one column. The authors of the\r\nreport reserved their precision for other minorities. The problem with race in the United\r\nStates is not just demographic or geographic. It is about taking care to use precise terms. In “The Third Man,” the African-American professor gets on stage and “refers (in one breath) to ‘Blacks and Latinos,’ his synonym for the disadvantaged in America” (126). As Rodriguez points out, only by tearing down the racial dichotomy in America, by\r\nrecognizing the “third” man— the brown, the yellow, and all the colors beyond—can\r\nwe distinguish between and talk more intelligently about culture, heritage, and blood,\r\nand recognize that these designations exist independently of race.\r\n\r\nDespite what my school district thinks, I, at least, know that I am not white. I\r\nhave Taiwanese blood, though many would claim that it is no different from Chinese\r\nblood. In terms of race, I would happily surrender to either category, but most surveys\r\nsettle simply for the ambiguous term “Asian.” Even the bum on the street knew more\r\nabout my nationality. If “[r]ace is America’s theme—not freedom, not democracy (as\r\nwe say in company)” (Rodriguez 136), then why are we so careless with our language\r\nwhen addressing race, compared to our diction in discussing national ideals? Could it be that the English language lacks the complexity needed to describe my race?\r\n\r\nOne problem with affirmative action is that it is hampered by politically correct\r\nlanguage. Experts on race fear they will offend broad groups if they distinguish between suburban black families and inner-city black families, between first-generation\r\nimmigrant Chinese and Chinese who don’t actually speak Chinese. These distinctions\r\nare personal and they rely on assumptions, but they are necessary for even broader\r\ndistinctions of race to be meaningful. Yet, it is out of a concern for decency that\r\naffirmative action becomes a dichromatic system splitting the population into two broad\r\ngroups: the Fortunate and the Unfortunate, demarcated by skin color. Such polarization\r\nbenefits few minorities, because no one willingly accepts the “Unfortunate” label. As\r\nRodriguez points out: “Not so long ago, Hispanics, particularly Mexicans and Cubans,\r\nresisted the label of ‘minority.’ … I remember my young Mexican mother saying to her\r\nchildren, in Spanish, ‘We are not minorities’” (126).\r\n\r\nOf income, education, ability, age, culture, upbringing, geographic ties, and all\r\nof the characteristics by which we determine a person’s circumstances, skin color is the\r\nmost visible, but it is also the least indicative of a person’s capacities. If we are\r\ncommitted to healing the racial scars in our nation’s history, why do we continue to use\r\nrace—a construct that inflicted such wounds in the first place—so widely in decisions we make in education and the job market? Why do we try to use the term so\r\nubiquitously in affirmative action when it is so bogged down by political correctness\r\nand so devoid of linguistic precision?\r\n\r\nI have a residential advisor, Nicholas, who is from Ecuador and speaks English\r\nwith a Spanish accent. He shocked me the day I moved in by greeting me in flawless,\r\nunaccented Mandarin Chinese. What race is he, then, according to my language-isidentity\r\nmodel? What race am I, now that I write better in English but speak more\r\nfluently in Mandarin, that I alternate between two languages when I talk to my siblings,\r\nthat my inner monologue is conducted in English, but that I automatically switch to\r\nChinese whenever I count and do math? Does it mean that I belong to neither race? Can I acquire a new race the same way Nicholas and I have acquired new languages, new modes of thinking? Could I “lose” it in the same way Rodriguez tried to rid himself of his Hispanic identity by refusing to use Spanish?\r\n\r\nMight a pedestrian in the street care about what I have to say and be able to see\r\nme for more than my skin color?\r\n\r\nBy stepping back and viewing race not as something that envelops us but instead\r\nas something beyond us, we can begin to see the details of the identities into which we are unwittingly born. Only by learning Spanish did I learn the mechanics behind\r\nEnglish that I would have learned in ESL classes. Likewise, only by viewing my\r\nTaiwanese heritage from the viewpoint of the English language was I able to see both in a clearer light. The “third” man sees both sides of a conflict clearer than the participants themselves.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I talk about race because I believe that no one grows up automatically\r\nprepared to speak in the American racial dialogue.

(242, 5, '2011-12-19 07:15:33', '2011-12-19 07:15:33', 'I stand at the corner of Broadway and 128th Street. Overhead, the elevated No. 1 train rumbles by. Once this has passed, a ratcheting from the auto body shop to my left picks up the chorus. Then, the high-pitched beeping of a truck in reverse chimes in. The layers of noise are rich with urban industry and have more presence than actual people. I head west on 128th Street toward the Hudson River and into the neighborhood that is the site of Columbia University’s proposed Manhattanville campus. I don’t see any trees along the street. The gray sidewalk makes a 90-degree angle with a warehouse building. The brick and concrete walls of this neighborhood are home to 400 residents and roughly 1,600 jobs. Columbia University is proposing to develop a secondary campus on the 17-acre plot of land in West Harlem. It is a 30-year expansion plan to “allow an elite but cramped university to build additional academic and residential buildings, including new facilities for its arts and business schools and dozens of modern science research labs it needs to keep pace with other Ivy League universities” (Williams). In addition to providing academic resources, the project is intended to weave the “university into the fabric of city life” (Columbia University Web site).\r\n\r\nTo develop the campus, most of the structures and people in the neighborhood will be displaced. Behind these walls is a community that has been sensitive to the threat of displacement since the ’60s, when the university was “purchasing apartment buildings all over Morningside Heights, displacing thousands of poor, mostly black and Puerto Rican residents” (Eviatar). This West Harlem neighborhood is the frontier of a gentrification movement sweeping through New York City and other American urban centers.\r\n\r\nIn his essay “Frontiers in American History and the Role of the Frontier Historian,” Jack D. Forbes defines the concept of a frontier as “a meeting point where two forces come up against each other, whether they be groups of human beings or such vague things as civilization and wilderness or knowledge and potential knowledge … [and therefore] there can be no frontier without … a contact situation” (206). The Manhattanville project has created a meeting point where the Columbia community comes into contact with the West Harlem community. At this frontier there are two fundamental points of tension: one is a local concern and involves debates about the development process of the new campus; the other is relevant to developing urban areas all over America and involves gentrification and the displacement of low-income residents. By viewing expansion in America through a historical lens, this paper examines the Manhattanville project and the contemporary threat of gentrification. It illuminates the perspectives of the Columbia and West Harlem communities at the Manhattanville frontier in an effort to understand the dynamics of the relationship at this “meeting point.”\r\n\r\nThe proposed Manhattanville campus is a result of Columbia’s efforts to remain a competitive Ivy League institution. In a 2006 New York Times article, Columbia President Lee Bollinger commented, “As knowledge grows and fields grow, we need more faculty, you need a certain scale.” He added, “Columbia has 194 square feet per student; Harvard boasts 368” (Eviatar). The Columbia community has argued that the new facilities will function as a place of intellectual and scientific development of benefit to society as a whole. In a 2007 New York Times article, Columbia spokeswomen La-Verna Fountain built on Bollinger’s comments, stating, “Columbia wants to work on the kinds of issues that impact humanity, like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease” (Lee). Columbia’s impetus for the Manhattanville campus stems from market pressures, but the project has the potential to generate contributions beyond self-interested financial gains. According to the Columbia community, the campus expansion can and should contribute to the development of a healthy society. The developmental logic of Columbia holds that expansion of its domain is related to societal advancement.\r\nIn an 1893 address before the American Historical Association in Chicago, Frederick Jackson Turner discussed the ideological relationship between expansion and a successful society. He provided an Anglo-American description of America’s western frontier during the 1890s and the societal implications of Manifest Destiny:\r\n\r\nThe peculiarity of the American institution is the fact that they have been compelled to adapt themselves to the changes of an expanding people—to the changes involved in crossing a continent, in winning a wilderness, and in developing at each area of this progress out of the primitive economic and political conditions of the frontier into the complexity of city life. (2)\r\n\r\nTurner applauded America for “continually advancing [its] frontier line … this fluidity of American life, this expansion westward with its new opportunities, its continuous touch with the simplicity of primitive society, furnish the forces dominating American character” (2). This perspective can help us understand the debate about the Manhattanville project by contextualizing the situation within the historical approach of the “American character” to growth. The Columbia administration’s motivations do not mimic Turner’s statement in regard to how the native community of West Harlem is viewed, nor does the Columbia community view West Harlem as a “wilderness” with “primitive economic and political conditions.” Columbia administrators argue, however, that the development of Manhattanville will advance societal progress as a whole. Turner argued that the expansion of the Western frontier helped solidify America’s national character and some areas of governmental policy: “It is safe to say that the legislation with regard to land, tariff, and internal improvements … was conditioned on frontier ideas and needs” (27).\r\n\r\nColumbia champions an ideology similar to Turner’s, in that expansion would allow the university to make medical advancements of benefit to society. Bollinger comments, “We [Columbia] need to have the property in order to build a campus … that’s able to do the kind of intellectual work that needs to be done …” He continues, “We cure disease and find cures, and we try to understand the world, and we educate people, and we are basically a public service institution” (Columbia Spectator). The relationship that Turner suggests—between expansion and societal development—is also prevalent in Columbia’s perspective. This is a relationship that has been the driving force of American urban growth since the settling of the Western frontier, as discussed by Turner, more than a century ago.\r\n\r\nForbes argues that the Turner approach to the frontier neglects the populations that already live in the area of desired expansion. He criticizes Turner’s account of the western frontier: “while undoubtedly serving a useful purpose within the frame work of Anglo-American nationalism, [Turner’s ideas are] essentially one-sided and ethnocentric. It is in effect looking at an inter-group contact situation entirely from the point of view of one of the interested participants” (204-205). As we saw earlier, Forbes points out that any frontier frames two groups “in a contact situation.” Turner’s “one-sided” approach undermines this idea and overlooks the social dynamics present at a frontier. This criticism is not entirely applicable to Columbia’s approach to the Manhattanville project, as the university is well aware of the West Harlem community. However, the development of Manhattanville has been initiated by, designed for, and is largely beneficial to only one party, the Columbia community.\r\n\r\nThe West Harlem community’s inequality in the development project is exemplified by Columbia’s attempt to acquire the land. The university already owns over 50 percent of the 17-acre property, but needs to purchase the remaining buildings before it can develop the campus. There is a group of West Harlem property owners who refuse to sell to the university. The group is concerned that they will lose clientele if they have to relocate their businesses. Columbia has made clear that, if necessary, it will use eminent domain laws to acquire the rest of the land. Eminent domain allows the state to transfer property from one private owner to another. The residents of West Harlem question why the university insists on occupying all of the land in the proposed area. In a 2007 New York Times article, local resident Luisa Henriquez complained, “They want us out of here, they want it all. Columbia should work around us; they say everything is for the students. What about us?” (Lee).\r\n\r\nColumbia President Bollinger counters that “if needed to fulfill our public service responsibility and if the state were willing to use eminent domain … it would be irresponsible to take it off the table” (Columbia Spectator). This standpoint raises Forbes’s concern that the traditional Turner-American approach to expansion can cause a one-sided expression of growth. West Harlem residents have opinions concerning eminent domain, but the complexity of the situation and Columbia’s dominant role serve to silence their voices.\r\n\r\nThe deeper source of tension at the Manhattanville frontier exceeds local concerns about the physical development of the campus. The Manhattanville project is symbolic of the gentrification process underway throughout Harlem. A 2002 Columbia Spectator article outlines the university’s role in this process:\r\n\r\nThe recent influx of higher-income individuals [to the Harlem area] has given many landlords a reason to overturn rental regulations in favor or wealthier tenants, thus disadvantaging long-time low-income residents … Students represent a large portion of these new, higher-paying tenants … and Columbia’s proximity makes this even more of a threat in Harlem than in other gentrified neighborhoods. (Johnson)\r\n\r\nAn influx of upper-middle-class students and staff threatens to displace lower-income local residents. The development of Manhattanville could become a new phase in an ongoing process that is destructive to the Harlem community’s heritage. Local residents are aware that the new campus will drive up surrounding real estate values and jeopardize their ability to live in the area. At an August 2007 public hearing, Nellie Bailey of the Harlem Tenants Council argued:\r\n\r\nColumbia University’s expansion cannot be viewed in isolation from the overall gentrification of Harlem … The masses of Blacks, especially the poor and working classes are exacerbated, angry, demoralized and put off … there is no political will from elected officials to provide a viable alternative to the powers-that-be including Columbia University’s land grab that will permanently alter the ethnic, socio-economic and political demographics of West Harlem, and by extension the greater community of Harlem. (NBPC website)\r\n\r\nBailey articulates the local community’s fear of being driven out of their own neighborhood and their resultant distrust of Columbia University. Still, the university argues that the proposed campus is designed to bolster neighborhood quality of life: “Columbia has promised to relocate residents directly displaced by its $7 billion plan, which it expects will create nearly 7,000 new jobs over 25 to 30 years … It has reserved space on the campus for a public school specializing in math, science and engineering” (Eviatar). Columbia plans to take financial responsibility for the dislocation of residents and, in turn, to focus on the potential for creating economic and educational opportunities in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nThe project offers other benefits, as evidenced by Columbia’s architectural design philosophy that “an urban campus isn’t defined by gates and walls, but by weaving the university into the fabric of city life.” (Columbia University Web site). The university boasts that “new trees, lighting, street furnishings, public art and publicly accessible open space would invite people to the entire area. New buildings would not only be open to the public but would also look and feel open because of transparent glass at the street level” (Columbia University Web site). This is an intelligent, modern approach to the urban placement of an academic institution. The goal of chief architect Renzo Piano, a native of Italy, is to create the feel of a piazza. He states, “the people will come, there will be discourse” (Eviatar). Piano and the university aim to create a space where the Ivy League and West Harlem communities can share their day-to-day activities and thereby engage in a dialogue that will further human understanding. This type of engagement is a fundamental device of intellectual inquiry and, if realized, could benefit both groups at the frontier.\r\n\r\nFor discourse to occur, however, there needs to be an element of trust between the West Harlem and Columbia communities. In her essay “The Uses of Sidewalks: Contact,” Jane Jacobs examines the elements necessary for constructive public contact. She states, “The sum of such casual public contact at a local level … is a feeling for the pubic identity of people, a web of public respect and trust, and a resource of personal or neighborhood need. The absence of this trust is a disaster to a city street. Its cultivation cannot be institutionalized. And, above all, it implies no private commitments” (73-74). The problem with Manhattanville’s attempt to create a public space where West Harlem and Columbia will have “contact at a local level” is that the very existence of the campus creates distrust between the two groups. Chairperson of the local community board Jordi Reyes-Montblanc commented, “On a scale of 1 to 10, Columbia is a minus 5 in terms of trust” (Williams). Due to the university’s fraught history with Harlem, concerns about eminent domain, and the threat of gentrification, the West Harlem community is hard-pressed to feel “pubic respect and trust” toward Columbia. Distrust—or, worse, resentment—could lead the Harlem community to avoid the new campus, which would obviously make physical and intellectual exchange with the Columbia community unlikely.\r\nIt is important to include the perspective of the students who would occupy the future Manhattanville campus, as they would be responsible for half of the intercultural discourse that might occur at this frontier. As a Columbia student, I am aware of my contribution to the gentrification of the Morningside Heights neighborhood and feel some discomfort in being party to a process that has driven out local residents. I do realize that gentrification has helped to make the neighborhood safer for the residents who live here, and I appreciate my opportunities as a Columbia student. Given what I understand of the Manhattanville frontier, however, I am unsure of my ability to engage in a dialogue with the West Harlem community. If the local community is uncomfortable with my presence in West Harlem due to eminent domain disputes or the larger threat of gentrification that I represent, then I too would be uncomfortable on the campus. If my presence is a source of tension for the local community, I would be nervous to enter the campus. And yet I agree with Columbia’s argument that the expansion can be seen as an opportunity to weave “the university into the fabric of city life.”\r\nBy viewing the dynamics of the Manhattanville-West Harlem relationship as a frontier, one can better understand the perspective of both parties affected by this meeting point. The university’s expansion is part of the larger history of unequal growth and development that spans from the American West’s “civilization” to contemporary gentrification frontiers. The conflicting needs and concerns of the Columbia and West Harlem communities make for a challenging relationship. But by making an effort to preserve the local community, Columbia University has an opportunity to rethink how American institutions approach growth. The Manhattanville project could become a model for expansion that is sensitive to the economic, social, and cultural complexities present at the urban frontier. ', 'Manhattanville, Meet West Harlem: An Urban Frontier', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'manhattanville-meet-west-harlem-an-urban-frontier', '', '', '2012-02-27 14:37:34', '2012-02-27 14:37:34', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=242', 0, 'essay', '', 0);

This is a (among others) women’s rights issue.” Along with civil laws introduced after the 1979 Islamic Revolution that categorize women as “half of men” (in terms of witness testimony, blood money for murder, etc.), one of the contentious women’s rights issues in Iran is the mandatory veil2. Iran is one of the few countries in the world with four distinct seasons. The summers are hot, if not boiling—100ºF in July. You’d be inclined to wear shorts perhaps, but if you are female, that would mean putting yourself at risk of imprisonment, flogging or a fine. Per Article 638 of the Islamic Penal Code of Iran, “Women who appear in public without a proper hijab should be imprisoned from ten days to two months or pay a fine of 50,000 to 500,000 Ryal.” 3\r\n\r\nIn his essay “Behind the Official Story,” James Scott discusses the discrepancy between how people “appear in public” and how they act in private. Of relevance and interest here is the “public performance required of those subject to elaborate and systematic forms of social subordination” (2). Muslim women the world over choose to wear the veil. But when wearing the veil is mandated by law—as in Iran—it becomes unclear whether women wear it out of genuine personal and/or religious motivations, or merely to satisfy a public image required by law, as part of a mandatory “public performance” (2). Early in his essay, Scott distinguishes between the “public transcript” and the “private transcript.” His analysis and examples deal chiefly with the divide between public and private verbal interaction. However, he does note: “A second and vital aspect of the hidden transcript that has not been sufficiently emphasized is that it does not contain only speech acts but a whole range of practices” (14). Scott identifies practices such as “poaching, pilfering, clandestine tax evasion” on part of the dominated ones and “luxury and privilege, surreptitious use of hired thugs, bribery and tampering with land titles” on part of the dominators (14). In “Behind the Official Story,” Scott goes beyond chronicling the difference between what subordinates are able to say in the presence of their dominators (“public transcript”) and what they can only speak of among themselves (“private transcript”) and vice versa; he ultimately calls into question the entire functioning of power structures in society. It is worth examining the “theatrical imperatives that normally prevail in situations of domination” in the case of the veiled versus the unveiled woman. 4\r\n\r\nIn her autobiographical graphic novel Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood, Marjane Satrapi traces her childhood in post-revolutionary Tehran. The first section, entitled “The Veil,” speaks of “1980: the year it became obligatory to wear the veil at school” (3) 5. Born into a “very modern and avant-garde” (6) family, Satrapi faces an identity crisis caused by the clash between the pro-revolutionary undercurrents at school and opposing opinions at home, until she “really do[es]n’t know what to think about the veil” (6). Satrapi emphasizes the stark contrast between her two identities by using only two colors, black and white, for all of the book’s illustrations. The image on page 6 is especially powerful, split down the middle with a black background on the left and a white background on the right. Yet it is far from symmetrical: on the left Satrapi is unveiled, and on the right she is veiled. Interestingly, the background on the left depicts a ruler, a hammer and cogs, images associated with work and possibly a career. The background on the right, by contrast, depicts quintessential Islamic floral designs. Along with the mandatory veil law came additional limitations on women’s freedom, so the veiled woman was more restricted to the home than her previously unveiled self. Article 1105 of the Civil Code of Iran states: “In relations between husband and wife; the position of the head of the family is the exclusive right of the husband.” 6 Thus, the dichotomy between the private and public “transcripts” of women can be seen as a parallel to the dichotomy in gender roles brought about by gender-specific laws. Recently, loaded phrases such as “looking beyond the veil,” “behind the veil” and “you can’t judge a woman by her cover” have been used as the clichéd titles of documentaries and feature stories, perhaps because the veil denotes a symbolic barrier between the public, veiled woman and her private, unveiled counterpart. The veil is more than just an article of clothing; it is, in fact, an entire mode of conduct.\r\n\r\nAs discussed earlier, the mandatory veil law was accompanied by other restrictive laws concerning how a woman must act—or, in Scott’s terminology, “perform”—in public. Thus, the differences between a woman when she is veiled and when she is unveiled extend beyond her speech to her behavior, actions and gestures. Persepolis helps us detect such nuances through pointed illustrations. Without her veil, Satrapi’s mother is an outspoken liberal: on page 76, she is pictured with short hair, arched eyebrows, a strong mouth and a fist in the air, along with a speech bubble adamantly declaring: “She (Marjane) should start learning to defend her rights as a woman right now!” Contrast this with the meek depiction of her public self when confronted by the infamous “morality police”: she is veiled and her eyes are visibly wider as she thanks the policeman almost too profusely for letting her husband go without charges: “Thanks, thanks so much!” (109). Instead of being clenched in a fist, her hands are shown raised with palms facing outward in a gesture of surrender. Even within a single image, Satrapi subtly suggests the existence of dichotomies.\r\n\r\nAlthough Satrapi’s mother looks self-assured and confident on p.76, Satrapi divides her face into a white left-half and a black right-half. Are we to understand, then, that even when the woman is unveiled and in private, her public veiled self is present within her? Scott posits that “those obliged by domination to act a mask will eventually find that their faces have grown to fit that mask” (10). It is possible that in this nuanced image, Satrapi is pointing towards the same idea – that Satrapi’s mother cannot shed her public mask completely even in private. In other words, while the material veil may be removed upon entering the house, shedding the non-corporeal veil is not so simple. It may also be worth noting that Satrapi colors the outspoken part of Satrapi’s mother (with the raised fist) black; the use of black may indicate obscurity – emphasizing that this part of Satrapi’s mother must remain private, hidden. Interestingly, the behavior of Satrapi’s father, who is obviously unveiled at all times, is a lot more consistent. He talks back to the same police officer, saying, “I won’t take that from you. For twenty years I’ve worked for this country and you dare to talk to me like that?” (108) and thus risks arrest on grounds of insolence. In this instance, it may be relevant to consider Scott’s “crude and global generalization” that “the greater the disparity in power … the more the public transcript of subordinates will take on a stereotyped, ritualistic cast … the more menacing the power, the thicker the mask” (3). The disparity in power between a policeman and a veiled civilian female is greater than that between a policeman and a civilian male. This is partially due to the vastly different legal systems for females and males. Article 638 of the Islamic Penal Code of Iran (above) dealing with “Offenses Against Public Morals” applies exclusively to women. Thus, this power disparity makes for a greater disparity between a woman’s public and hidden personas than a man’s. Yet, assuming that the mandatory veil law is repressive and requires a “public performance” from women is a dangerous generalization because there are many women in Iran who, regardless of the law, would wear the veil out of personal conviction. The fact that many Muslim women living in countries without such laws choose to wear a veil should give us pause. Scott recognizes this problem when he writes of the danger of assuming that public conduct is, in fact, a performance: What warrant have we to call it a performance at all, thereby impugning its authenticity?\r\n\r\nThe answer is, surely, that we cannot know how contrived or imposed the performance is unless we can speak, as it were, to the performer offstage, out of this particular power-laden context, or unless the performer suddenly declares openly, on stage, that the performances we have previously observed were just a pose? (4) Since Persepolis is a first-person narrative, we are given insight into Satrapi’s personal views on the veil in particular and the post-revolutionary regime in general. We also see marked differences between how she conducts (or is forced to conduct) herself on the streets of Tehran and how she rebels within the four walls of her room, listening to rock music: “I put my posters up in my room. I put my 1983 Nikes on … and my denim jacket with the Michael Jackson button” (131). The material transformation from the private unveiled to the public veiled self is perhaps best illustrated by the images on page 131. Notice how Satrapi changes from a typical wild teenager playing air guitar in front of an Iron Maiden poster to a slightly mischievous one tying her laces and, finally, to a demure, sedated young woman after she has donned her veil in the last image.\r\n\r\nIt is worth observing that the quintessentially Western concepts of rock bands and branded shoes are associated with the private self, while the public self reflects Iranian and Islamic culture. This should have great ramifications for our understanding of gender discriminatory laws: there were obviously political as well as religious motives for the Islamic Revolution that overthrew the pro-Western Shah and led to the introduction of the laws in question. Satrapi also reveals how women who do not personally agree with the law subtly express their otherwise hidden views in public: “In no time, the way people dressed became an ideological sign. There were two kinds of women. The Fundamentalist Woman. The Modern Woman. You showed your opposition to the regime by letting a few strands of hair show” (75). These understated acts of defiance allow us to distinguish between performers and those who act out of personal conviction. What, though, is the consequence of the hidden transcript becoming public, even subtly so? Punishment by law aside, the non-conforming woman faces threats and public humiliation if she fails to play the part of the veiled woman adequately.\r\n\r\nWhen Satrapi steps out into the streets wearing her denim jacket and her Michael Jackson pin, showing a few defiant strands of hair, she is confronted by “The Guardians of the Revolution: The Women’s Branch” (132) who call her a “whore,” among other things (133). It is intriguing how women subject to the same laws choose to enforce them on other women in the same position as themselves. The motivations for such treatment of women by women are puzzling; a possible explanation could be that in the strictest view of Islam, men are not allowed to touch female suspects and, thus, in Iran it is generally female police officers (often casually referred to as the “fashion police”) who deal with women who violate the dress code. A more vociferous show of opposition has more dire consequences, as we see when a group of unveiled women rallying against the regime and the veil law are suppressed by violence: “The scarf or a beating” (76). The result of such suppression is then, of course, a more defined boundary between the hidden and the public transcript, and a thicker public mask: “That was our last demonstration” (76). As readers of Persepolis, we must understand the historical situation—it portrays the immediate aftermath of the Islamic Revolution in Iran. The book is based on Satrapi’s own childhood in the early 1980s. The laws in Iran have undergone amendments since then, leading to altered power-dynamics. Under President Mohammad Khatami, who was elected in 1997, enforcement of the veil law was loosened, which led to women wearing shorter coats, looser scarves and more colorful clothing. More importantly, Iranian women today are reentering the job market, the number of Iranian women graduating from college is surpassing the number of men, and women are also participating in the democratic process as elected members of the Islamic Consultative Assembly, Iran’s national legislative body.\r\n\r\nAs the power balance in any domination paradigm (in this case, the state-citizen paradigm) varies, so too do the nature and extent of a “hidden transcript.” One could say that under more liberal conditions, the veil slips back both literally and figuratively, and that there is now less of a barrier between the public veiled woman and her private unveiled self. However, as Scott points out, “power relations are not, alas, so straightforward” (5), and so to assume a directly proportional relationship between the stringency of laws and the extent of a hidden transcript amounts to oversimplification. While a connection obviously exists, in a scenario where there is such a clear division between choice and compulsion, the dangers of generalization are far too great for us to draw a definitive conclusion. Still, it may be safe to say that since the early 1980s, the black-and-white contrast of Satrapi’s Iran has made way for less stark shades of gray.\r\n<h2> Note</h2>\r\n1. FitzGerald, Edward.

(244, 5, '2011-12-19 07:23:50', '2011-12-19 07:23:50', 'My family resides in Seoul, the most prosperous and developed city in South Korea. We live in a twenty-four-story apartment building, which provides an energy-saving central heating system. An apartment setting essentially helps us save energy, since heat escaping from our apartment helps to heat the apartment above ours. The subway station is a ten-minute walk, and buses stop in front of the apartment complex. We therefore prefer taking public transit to driving cars in the middle of traffic jams. In Seoul, a life like this is not particular to my family; most of the buildings—both residential and commercial—are at least ten and often twenty stories high; Seoul Metro, a part of Seoul subway system, daily transports six million people (60% of Seoul’s population).\r\n\r\nIn his essay “Green Manhattan,” David Owen praises the extreme compactness of urban centers like Manhattan for their “greenness.” He asserts that “New York is the greenest community in United States, and one of the greenest cities in the world” (1). Because of the city’s dense population, New Yorkers mostly take public transit, reducing fossil fuel use, and use skyscrapers, which save more heating and cooling energy than houses thanks to less exposed exterior surface per square foot of interior space. Owen’s vocabulary of “density” opens up the possibility of seeing Seoul as a “green” place. Resembling many aspects of Manhattan that Owen enumerates, Seoul generates less greenhouse gases, conserves more energy, and produces less waste per capita than suburban communities. However, looking at the landscape of the city, I feel troubled calling Seoul green. Is Seoul—the city of asphalt lands and skyscraper forests—really green?\r\n\r\nOwen oversimplifies the term “green” by describing urban centers as green. The term “green” applies to two different qualities. One is metaphorical green, as Owen uses: energy-efficiency and pollution decrease —saving the planet. The other is more literal: trees, grasses, and plants—the elements of nature that are indeed green in color. If the former promotes the health of planet, the latter does the individual health; many people move to rural places when sick. The former relates to communal responsibility, while the latter does to individual interest. Both greens are important in human life. We cannot abandon our responsibility to save the earth to pursue our selfish interests. Conversely, we cannot sacrifice our own interests altogether to fulfill that responsibility. I believe that the ultimately “green” place should provide both greens. Although, at first glance, the two greens do not seem to differ too much, in reality, they often contradict each other. Then, how do we create the “ultimately green” place? How do we balance the literal green and the metaphorical green, or individual interest and civic responsibility?\r\nOwen’s argument is, in itself, a telling example of the difficulty of balancing the two. He attempts to solve the question by urging us to “make other settled places more like Manhattan” (3). He criticizes the sprawling environment of “other settled paces” like suburbia, with their scattering of houses, workplaces, and shops, for their ecological malignancy. One-story houses, which rarely contain a central heating system, radiate more heat than apartment buildings and therefore use more energy; yards, which are often over-watered, require lawnmowers that are hardly energy efficient; worst of all, cars, the obvious fossil fuel consumers, become a necessity in suburbia. Owen therefore insists that we should transform suburban towns into more densely-populated cities to save energy, consume less fossil fuel, and ultimately to better the health of the planet.\r\nThe solution, however, fails to acknowledge the self-interests involved in a life in suburbia. Owen’s argument does not balance communal responsibility and self-interest; rather, it chooses communal responsibility at the expense of self-interest. The dilemma is too complex to resolve in such simple terms, and his solution is therefore impractical. Owen’s own move demonstrates the impracticality of his claims. Although he advocates the virtues of living in urban centers and condemns living in suburbia, he contradicts himself by moving to a suburban town from Manhattan:\r\n\r\n[My wife and I] had both grown up in suburbs, and we decided that we didn’t want to raise our tiny daughter in a huge city. Shortly after she learned to walk, we moved to a small town in northwestern Connecticut, about ninety miles north of midtown Manhattan. Our house, which was built in the late seventeen-hundreds, is across a dirt road from a nature preserve and is shaded by tall white-pine trees. After big rains, we can hear a swollen creek rushing by at the bottom of the hill. Deer, wild turkeys, and the occasional black bear feed themselves in our yard. From the end of our driveway, I can walk several miles through woods to an abandoned nineteenth-century railway tunnel, while crossing only one paved road (1-2).\r\n\r\nBy telling us that he wanted to raise his daughter in suburbia, just as he and his wife grew up, rather than in an urban center, Owen admits that some individual interests may be fulfilled better in suburbia—around tall pine trees, streams, and wild animals. He later mentions more explicitly the “growing desire to live a more natural, biological life under pleasanter and more natural conditions” (4). The sharply-contrasting environments of urban centers hardly fulfill that desire. Owen acknowledges the drawbacks of living in Manhattan: “Manhattan is loud and dirty, and the subway is depressing, and the fumes from the cars and cabs and buses can make people sick. Presumably for environmental reasons, New York City has one of the highest childhood-asthma rates in the country” (3).\r\n\r\nNew York City deprives its residents of a clean environment and ultimately their health. While inhabiting a dense city may be beneficial on a societal level, residing in suburbia near nature may be healthier on an individual level. Because Owen’s argument considers only civic responsibility and does not take individual interest into account, even the arguer fails to be consistent with his own claim.\r\n\r\nRuminating on my own experience in suburbia, I also find it hard to abandon the literal green of suburban towns for the metaphorical green of cities. When my family lived in Pasadena, California, we picnicked at a nearby lake which was peaceful and spacious, instead of the park in Seoul which is crowded and often trashed. I ran around the woods and chased chipmunks in the yard, instead of playing in an outdoor parking lot where my parents repeatedly reminded me to be careful of the cars. My dad taught me constellations in the dark, instead of being bothered by the numerous lights that veil the glow of stars. My mom, especially, misses the days in Pasadena. Even though she lives in a metaphorically green environment, she yearns to leave Seoul for a more literal green. Claims like Owen’s will not persuade people like my mom to live in urban centers since to them the pleasure of living around nature, which Seoul seldom provides, is the value that cannot be compromised by any others.\r\n\r\nIn fact, literal green is not an antonym of environmentalism. Living in suburbia may not necessarily be totally harmful to environment, since it may help us foster more responsible environmentalism. In his essay “The Trouble with Wilderness,” William Cronon discusses responsible environmentalism—the right way to view wilderness. He questions the modern American environmental movement that idealizes wilderness over human settlements.[The] idea of wilderness has for decades been a fundamental tenet – indeed a passion – of the environmental movement, especially in the United States. For many Americans wilderness stands as the last remaining place where civilization, that all too human disease, has not fully infected the earth. … [In fact, instead, wilderness] is a product of that civilization (83). Owen also writes of the flaws of modern American environmentalism: most Americans consider “wild, unspoiled landscapes—the earth before it was transmogrified by human inhabitation” as ecological, although Manhattan, “one of the most thoroughly altered landscapes imaginable, an almost wholly artificial environment, in which the terrain’s primeval contours have long since been obliterated,” is one of the most environmentally friendly places in America (2). Like Owen, Cronon disapproves of associating wild and uninhabited land with a true environmental area.\r\nAlthough both Cronon and Owen advocate for people to change the aims of modern environmentalism, Cronon is less interested than Owen in assessing ecological benefits of urban centers and instead focuses on “discovering what an ethical, sustainable, honorable human place in nature might actually look like” (97). Cronon insists that the modern American environmental movement often equates the preservation of wild and uninhabited areas with saving the globe. He recognizes that “nonhuman nature and large tracts of the natural world do deserve protection” (98). He values the nonhuman nature like many others but warns against the danger of misusing the label “wilderness”:\r\n\r\nTo the extent that we celebrate wilderness as the measure with which judge civilization, we reproduce the dualism that sets humanity and nature at opposite poles. …Worse: to the extent that we live in an urban-industrial civilization but at the same time pretend to ourselves that our real home is in the wilderness, to just that extent we give ourselves permission to evade responsibility for the lives we actually lead (97).\r\n\r\nBy imagining nonhuman wilderness as an angelic world where we can escape from the troubles of devastating human civilization, we set ourselves outside of nature and often let ourselves desert the responsible use of the “home” that we actually inhabit. Such a misguided concept of wilderness thereby threatens the place of responsible environmentalism.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative, Cronon suggests that we find nature in our own backyards and embrace both city and wilderness as “home.” He celebrates the moments that remind us of the nature all around us, since they let us realize that nature is not distant and that our home should be the “middle ground in which responsible use and non-use might attain some kind of balanced, sustainable relationship” (103). By discovering the nature all around us, we can foster what Cronon calls responsible environmentalism.\r\nI thus contend that suburbia can promote responsible environmentalism. Recall Owen’s reflection on his suburban home in Connecticut. Recall my experience in Pasadena. In suburbia, we discovered the nature right beside us: shades of tall white-pine trees, a swollen creek that rushes after rains, wild animals that appears in the yard, a peaceful lake by which to enjoy a picnic, several miles of woods for a walk, and even shining stars in the sky. We were touched by these little moments and learned to value nature as home, and home as nature. The place where we live is the nature that we must preserve.\r\n\r\nAfter moving to Seoul, my family became one of the most environmentally responsible in the town. My mom, especially, is determined to better the city’s environment. She never overheats or overcools the house; she washes cans, bottles, and paper covers of milk packs to recycle them; she always buys refillable shampoo or detergent to reuse the bottles; she usually travels by foot or on buses or subways rather than in her own car; she often volunteers to clean trashed parks with her fellow residents. However, my friends who have always lived in city like Seoul often have a hard time picturing their home as natural. While I feel guilty about the idea of littering the streets, they mindlessly drop garbage everywhere. Though they may rage at the sight of trashed mountain, they rarely feel guilty trashing their own home. To my family, home is the nature that we need to preserve. To my friends in Seoul, home is the already-polluted environment that they need not care for. If that is the case, suburbia—the literal green—should not be sacrificed because it is, to some extent, necessary to encourage responsible environmentalism.\r\nYet, metaphorical green must not be ignored either. Despite the advantages of a life in suburbia, we do need to realize its drawbacks. When my family lived in Pasadena, we harmed the environment just as Owen criticizes. We lived in a one-story house that is far less energy-efficient than apartment buildings, with a neat lawn that required a lawnmower and water, and hence a significant amount of energy. Moreover, we consumed tremendous amounts of fossil fuel: my parents drove me to kindergarten, drove to their jobs, drove to Target to shop, drove to meet their friends, and drove ten miles to the gas stations. Even more troubling, I wonder if my mom would still be environmentally as responsible in Pasadena as she is in Seoul. Would she be able to use public transit and consume less energy? While suburbia may be environmentally-friendly in the literal sense, suburbia needs reformation to become green in the metaphorical sense.\r\n\r\nCronon discusses a similar dilemma. He recognizes the worth of the unused natural world but equally values the responsibly-used civilization. Thus, he seeks “a middle ground in which responsible use and non-use might attain some kind of balanced, sustainable relationship.” To better the environment, he believes that we should explore the middle ground of wilderness and civilization. He furthers his argument by asserting that the middle ground is our home—the home that we should be responsible for both using and not using. In a similar context, to make the world greener, we must find the “middle ground,” where literal green and metaphorical green are balanced. It is important to consider the ecological benefits of urban centers, but we should not underestimate the advantages of suburbia. To reach that middle ground, we must make suburbia metaphorically greener and urban centers literally greener. To reach that middle ground, we must be motivated to better our home—the home that encompasses both our self interests and communal responsibilities, the home we want to improve for ourselves and the home for which we are responsible.\r\n\r\nOwen’s impractical suggestion of “making other settled places more like Manhattan” can help us attain the middle ground, if we adjust his argument in a less radical way. For example, we can encourage people to walk rather than to drive by widening the sidewalks, narrowing the streets, and moving buildings closer to the edge of sidewalks. Mixing residential and commercial use can also help, since this kind of zoning enables people to shop without driving. We can make commercial buildings, which do not provide significantly more literal green, more energy-efficient by designing them so that they are one story higher and closer together. Adding public transportation would reduce a significant amount of fossil fuel use, but if this is not feasible due to scattered houses, organizing car pools would be a good alternative.\r\n\r\nIn a similar way, by making urban centers more like suburban towns, we can find ways to make urban centers literally greener by mimicking aspects of suburbia, including: lawns that are large enough to accommodate running children in apartment complexes; incorporating greenery into buildings themselves, and planting more trees and plants on side streets to make urban daily life greener in color. Taking advantage of outstanding public transit systems, we can also create wild parks easily accessible by subways or buses.\r\nIt is not easy to figure out how to balance the two greens. We are often frustrated by the difficulty of fulfilling both self interest and civic responsibility at the same time. But to attain a better home that is truly green, we must consider the problem. Neither Seoul nor Pasadena is truly green, for they lack one green or the other. To transform them, we do not need to be motivated by a universal action. Small efforts to better our home can help. In Seoul, we can pick up trash and value the trees on the sidewalk. In Pasadena, we can ride a hybrid car and carpool. If we realize the significance of both greens, if we learn to be responsible for our home, and if we continuously search for that middle ground, then perhaps, one day, both Seoul and Pasadena will shine in green. ', 'For the Ultimate Green', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'for-the-ultimate-green', '', '', '2012-02-27 05:36:19', '2012-02-27 05:36:19', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=244', 0, 'essay', '', 0);

(407, 8, '2012-02-27 05:36:55', '2012-02-27 05:36:55', 'My family resides in Seoul, the most prosperous and developed city in South Korea. We live in a twenty-four-story apartment building, which provides an energy-saving central heating system. An apartment setting essentially helps us save energy, since heat escaping from our apartment helps to heat the apartment above ours. The subway station is a ten-minute walk, and buses stop in front of the apartment complex. We therefore prefer taking public transit to driving cars in the middle of traffic jams. In Seoul, a life like this is not particular to my family; most of the buildings—both residential and commercial—are at least ten and often twenty stories high; Seoul Metro, a part of Seoul subway system, daily transports six million people (60% of Seoul’s population).\r\n\r\nIn his essay “Green Manhattan,” David Owen praises the extreme compactness of urban centers like Manhattan for their “greenness.” He asserts that “New York is the greenest community in United States, and one of the greenest cities in the world” (1). Because of the city’s dense population, New Yorkers mostly take public transit, reducing fossil fuel use, and use skyscrapers, which save more heating and cooling energy than houses thanks to less exposed exterior surface per square foot of interior space. Owen’s vocabulary of “density” opens up the possibility of seeing Seoul as a “green” place. Resembling many aspects of Manhattan that Owen enumerates, Seoul generates less greenhouse gases, conserves more energy, and produces less waste per capita than suburban communities. However, looking at the landscape of the city, I feel troubled calling Seoul green. Is Seoul—the city of asphalt lands and skyscraper forests—really green?\r\n\r\nOwen oversimplifies the term “green” by describing urban centers as green. The term “green” applies to two different qualities. One is metaphorical green, as Owen uses: energy-efficiency and pollution decrease —saving the planet. The other is more literal: trees, grasses, and plants—the elements of nature that are indeed green in color. If the former promotes the health of planet, the latter does the individual health; many people move to rural places when sick. The former relates to communal responsibility, while the latter does to individual interest. Both greens are important in human life. We cannot abandon our responsibility to save the earth to pursue our selfish interests. Conversely, we cannot sacrifice our own interests altogether to fulfill that responsibility. I believe that the ultimately “green” place should provide both greens. Although, at first glance, the two greens do not seem to differ too much, in reality, they often contradict each other. Then, how do we create the “ultimately green” place? How do we balance the literal green and the metaphorical green, or individual interest and civic responsibility?\r\nOwen’s argument is, in itself, a telling example of the difficulty of balancing the two. He attempts to solve the question by urging us to “make other settled places more like Manhattan” (3). He criticizes the sprawling environment of “other settled paces” like suburbia, with their scattering of houses, workplaces, and shops, for their ecological malignancy. One-story houses, which rarely contain a central heating system, radiate more heat than apartment buildings and therefore use more energy; yards, which are often over-watered, require lawnmowers that are hardly energy efficient; worst of all, cars, the obvious fossil fuel consumers, become a necessity in suburbia. Owen therefore insists that we should transform suburban towns into more densely-populated cities to save energy, consume less fossil fuel, and ultimately to better the health of the planet.\r\nThe solution, however, fails to acknowledge the self-interests involved in a life in suburbia. Owen’s argument does not balance communal responsibility and self-interest; rather, it chooses communal responsibility at the expense of self-interest. The dilemma is too complex to resolve in such simple terms, and his solution is therefore impractical. Owen’s own move demonstrates the impracticality of his claims. Although he advocates the virtues of living in urban centers and condemns living in suburbia, he contradicts himself by moving to a suburban town from Manhattan:\r\n\r\n[My wife and I] had both grown up in suburbs, and we decided that we didn’t want to raise our tiny daughter in a huge city. Shortly after she learned to walk, we moved to a small town in northwestern Connecticut, about ninety miles north of midtown Manhattan. Our house, which was built in the late seventeen-hundreds, is across a dirt road from a nature preserve and is shaded by tall white-pine trees. After big rains, we can hear a swollen creek rushing by at the bottom of the hill. Deer, wild turkeys, and the occasional black bear feed themselves in our yard. From the end of our driveway, I can walk several miles through woods to an abandoned nineteenth-century railway tunnel, while crossing only one paved road (1-2).\r\n\r\nBy telling us that he wanted to raise his daughter in suburbia, just as he and his wife grew up, rather than in an urban center, Owen admits that some individual interests may be fulfilled better in suburbia—around tall pine trees, streams, and wild animals. He later mentions more explicitly the “growing desire to live a more natural, biological life under pleasanter and more natural conditions” (4). The sharply-contrasting environments of urban centers hardly fulfill that desire. Owen acknowledges the drawbacks of living in Manhattan: “Manhattan is loud and dirty, and the subway is depressing, and the fumes from the cars and cabs and buses can make people sick. Presumably for environmental reasons, New York City has one of the highest childhood-asthma rates in the country” (3).\r\n\r\nNew York City deprives its residents of a clean environment and ultimately their health. While inhabiting a dense city may be beneficial on a societal level, residing in suburbia near nature may be healthier on an individual level. Because Owen’s argument considers only civic responsibility and does not take individual interest into account, even the arguer fails to be consistent with his own claim.\r\n\r\nRuminating on my own experience in suburbia, I also find it hard to abandon the literal green of suburban towns for the metaphorical green of cities. When my family lived in Pasadena, California, we picnicked at a nearby lake which was peaceful and spacious, instead of the park in Seoul which is crowded and often trashed. I ran around the woods and chased chipmunks in the yard, instead of playing in an outdoor parking lot where my parents repeatedly reminded me to be careful of the cars. My dad taught me constellations in the dark, instead of being bothered by the numerous lights that veil the glow of stars. My mom, especially, misses the days in Pasadena. Even though she lives in a metaphorically green environment, she yearns to leave Seoul for a more literal green. Claims like Owen’s will not persuade people like my mom to live in urban centers since to them the pleasure of living around nature, which Seoul seldom provides, is the value that cannot be compromised by any others.\r\n\r\nIn fact, literal green is not an antonym of environmentalism.

The choir director’s husband insisted that I talk to the interviewer, although the fellowship hour was almost over and the photographer had already left. I was hesitant, but I spoke to him honestly. When I read what I had said in the next Sunday’s Metro Section, I was half excited that my name was in The New York Times and half embarrassed at my lack of eloquence. But my candid answer served as a valuable looking glass into my opinion on the genocide and preserving its memory. In order for the genocide to be “recognized,” Turkey needs to admit that it occurred, but this can only happen if there is solid evidence supporting it. Every year, 1915 becomes more remote and genocide survivors more scarce. I am thus anxious for the genocide to be recognized by Turkey so that Armenians can “move on.” This article made me notice the extent to which I operate as a preservationist in many areas of my life, including my writing. But how does my writing relate to discovering better methods of persuading Turkey to recognize the genocide?\r\n\r\nThe theme of preservation is prominent in all three of my essays for this course. Each essay brought me closer to identifying the best way to preserve the past, even as I encountered and explored new problems of preserving memories. In my first essay, “New York City Apricots,” I focused on why immigrants retell their pasts instead of focusing on the present. I suggested that an exile is compelled to preserve and retell the past because it “continues to influence an exile’s life in the present” and because exiles often need to “prove [their] constancy and tame [their] fear of death” (6). In the case of my grandmother, she needed to continue retelling and reminding herself of the past because it brought her closer to it, so that the past, however difficult, seemed less remote, and death seemed more remote. When I realized in this essay that exiles must continue to remember the past, I was also reflecting on the importance of the Armenian Genocide in my life. In the New York Times quotation, I even stated that Armenians might “define” themselves by the genocide to keep that memory alive and to remind ourselves that our culture was not eliminated or allowed to die, but survived (Tirella). In my second essay, I explored how to record history to make it memorable. This concern stemmed from my desire to convince Turkey that the genocide occurred by making the history of the genocide vivid, relatable, and believable for the reader. As I discovered by the end of my second essay, making history more appealing also risks distorting reality. In my third essay, it made sense to investigate why certain writers would distort history. My culminating idea was that humans create distorted stories because they cannot handle failure, and those stories protect their idealized creations. In my three essays, I was subconsciously moving closer to answering the question of how to present a history of the Armenian Genocide so that it would be relatable and memorable, yet believable.\r\n\r\nLooking back, I notice that during all three progressions I often chose obscure quotations to propel me toward this goal. In my lens essay, I not only picked the source essay that nobody else in the class chose, but I also quoted the less prominent material from André Aciman’s “Shadow Cities,” such as his experiences in Rome. When trying to prove that an exile views all objects in the “key of loss,” I used Aciman’s description of old pictures of Rome, covered in “a series of colored transparencies,” which, when lifted, reveal “today’s ruins” (Aciman 47). Aciman invariably connects this image to his own internal state, allowing me to conclude that Aciman is looking at himself in his photos; Aciman’s current life is a ruin compared to his past. This roundabout analysis could have been simplified by quoting Aciman’s statement a few sentences earlier. He says that looking at the photographs or at any shadow city helps any exile, “like Narcissus leaning over a pool of water, find [himself] at every bend” (47). My unusual choice to draw out my claim with obscure quotations may reflect my fear of overlooking possible insights by excluding important but unnoticed examples. Perhaps I assumed that the more obvious quotes would be readily analyzed and emptied of insight and advice by others. My goal was to find what modern historians or genocide activists were doing wrong, and for that I drew insight from the less obvious. My care for often-ignored quotes may also reflect my concern with the way the Armenian Genocide has often been forgotten. In aspiring to remedy this problem of ignorance about the genocide, I chose to include quotes that I felt other readers would ignore.\r\n\r\nI also unwittingly made sure I quoted from each segment of my source essays. A curious instance occurred in my second essay, when I cited Georges Perec’s thoughts about noticing “not the exotic any more, but the endotic” (206). I felt compelled to quote from Perec’s third essay in the collection, even though I had not previously included it and was not planning to include it because it did not seem to contribute directly to my argument. This thoroughness demonstrated once more my subconscious fear of excluding an important detail that might hold the key to convincing Turkey and other governments to recognize the Armenian Genocide. All my choices as a writer mirror my treatment of the genocide. I was afraid time would erase the memory of the genocide, and that fear motivated my meticulous and thorough analyses. Perhaps I subconsciously thought that by being more thorough, I could learn how better to preserve the past and even shape a new approach to the genocide issue.\r\n\r\nAs I look back at the themes and conclusions I drew from each essay, I see that my main concerns when I finished each essay also share something surprising. Each time, I felt uncomfortable because I did not have enough space to address the full scope of issues I had intended to address. In my lens essay, I said I had “limited space” and that if “I had had more space, I would also have liked to explore my grandma’s use of ‘figments’ in her life in New York.” I longed to explore how my grandma preserved her past and how her techniques compared to Aciman’s methods. I wanted to learn how to incorporate methods of preservation into my own life in order to apply them to the genocide, so I regretted not being able to delve further into this inquiry. In my third essay, I did not have enough space or time to add “more about other aspects of [Jonathan] Lethem’s life.” I seemed to have an underlying anxiety about including everything, as if I could attempt to preserve every aspect of the genocide or as if I needed more information to better solve this problem.\r\n\r\nGenocides, battles, and mindless killings fill the pages of history and the newspapers of our modern day, but the Armenian Genocide is unique in that it has never been recognized or officially declared a genocide by its perpetrators. Figures such as Hitler have exploited this lack of attention to the Armenian Genocide. Hitler believed that the Holocaust would be forgotten, since “Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?” My underlying explorations, quoting tendencies, and anxieties reflected in these three essays are directly related to this lack of recognition. My anxiety to preserve the memory of the genocide produced a corresponding anxiety about writing my essays that drove me to explore problems in peculiar ways, quote material that did not seem obviously relevant, and worry even more than usual about making editorial comments. I wanted to be meticulous and thorough and to be a new kind of historian because I saw the failure of attempts to convince Turkey of the genocide’s reality. However, I cannot solve the problem of genocide recognition, no matter how many essays I write to explore it. This type of idealistic aspiration for perfect preservation by one person is impossible.

But I do remember my tiny role in Act III, scene ii of<em> Julius Caesar</em>. Caesar has just been killed and a crowd gathers, clamoring for an explanation. Most people know Marc Antony’s “Friends, Romans, countrymen,” and it is justly celebrated; but Brutus’ speech just before it, in which he describes his reasons for participating in the murder, has just as great an influence on the “throng of citizens,” though they are soon seduced by Antony’s rhetoric. I was one of those citizens, in a makeshift toga and inauthentic sandals, and at every rehearsal I was sincerely swayed by each speech in turn, first by Brutus’ denunciation of the dangers of ambition and then by Marc Antony’s impassioned list of Caesar’s virtues. I cried “Live, Brutus!” in all earnestness. And yet, when the First Citizen said “Methinks there is much reason in his sayings,” referring to Marc Antony’s speech, I was able to nod my head in agreement without a shade of affectation.\r\n\r\nMy susceptibility to other people’s rhetoric has not waned in the years since that theatrical venture. Although in theory I know the importance of critical distance, I can never resist falling in love with the bold claims of an unfamiliar ideology or the stylistic arabesques of an undiscovered essayist. This is all very well, and I occasionally flatter myself that I am quick to understand the works I grow fond of, but such an unqualified embrace of another’s ideas is dangerous. I absorb style and content so comprehensively that they become an ineradicable facet of my mental landscape. Once this assimilation has occurred, I can no longer engage in analytical thought without feeling the influence of this or that view, no longer set pen to paper without unconsciously remembering all the writers whose language I have loved. The unnerving part of this endless receptiveness to new ideas lies in my incapacity to distance myself from the authors I have read. They become so intrinsic a part of me that to regard them as foreign feels unhealthy, almost schizophrenic.\r\n\r\nMy most visible stylistic influences are transient and easily identifiable. Even when I know that this shaping process is taking place, I am powerless to put it to a halt. When we read Hemingway short stories in my English class last year, I grew increasingly annoyed with what I considered chauvinism in the message of his work. And yet, I could not extend my disapproval to the bright clarity of his prose style. My sentences grew shorter in spite of myself, my descriptions turned terse, and my adverbs came close to extinction. I have overcome this now (perhaps unfortunately), but for a time, I could not resist mimicking Hemingway’s stark prose. The summer I started <em>À la recherche du temps perdu</em>, I succumbed to the opposite impulse. In both French and English, my sentences swelled to paragraph size and became laden with relative clauses, parentheses, commas, and pronouns with ambiguous antecedents. Of course, prose so directly influenced by Proust can never aspire to anything like Proust’s eloquence; it comes off as a pathetic imitation or an ill-starred attempt at parody.\r\n\r\nThe narrator of Proust’s epic novel (tentatively named Marcel) also suffers from excessive adoration of other authors. In <em>Du côté de chez Swann</em>, the volume relating the narrator’s childhood, he describes his worship of the writer Bergotte. Here is an approximation of his sentiment, which is much more eloquent in French: “Feeling how many parts of the universe there were that my infirm perception would not distinguish unless [Bergotte] were to bring them closer to me, I would have liked to possess an opinion of his, a metaphor of his, on all things” (my translation; Proust 94). I, too, have felt this particular sort of submissive enthusiasm, or intellectual dependence, so that I am constantly using the theories of a given writer (Proust himself, Simone de Beauvoir, Henry James) as a reference against which to judge the quality of my own thoughts. Marcel goes on: “whenever by chance I happened to encounter, in this or that book of [Bergotte’s], an idea that I had had myself, my heart swelled up as if God in his greatness had given it back to me, declared it legitimate and beautiful” (94). This, then, is the real threat to originality: when only ideas that are echoed by other authors are seen as worthwhile.\r\n\r\nStylistic changes are not the most pernicious effects of unconditional love for certain authors. Real trouble begins when methods of thinking as well as ways of writing come under the influence. When I wrote my lens essay at the beginning of this term, for example, I had just read parts of Frantz Fanon’s <em>The Wretched of the Earth</em> and was filled with anti-colonial fervor.1 I was particularly drawn to the section of the book on the divisive effects of cultural imperialism and the difficulty experienced by the Western-educated elite of colonized countries to separate the positive values learned in colonial schools from the shameless Eurocentrism supported there. When looking for an exhibit to examine through the lens of Andre Aciman’s “oasis of the soul,” I could not help but draw links between his oasis and the one I imagined the colonized intellectual to have. Only now do I see the irony in being intellectually dominated by a theory about the dangers of intellectual domination. My admiration for Fanon was so manifest that I was wary about relying too heavily on him in my paper, and this guardedness ultimately prevented my lens essay from being totally derivative. In a defiant footnote on the first page, I demonstrated my awareness of that possibility: “[The “colonized intellectual”] is Frantz Fanon’s phrase from <em>Les damnés de la terre</em>. I am using it here for convenience, not to make a similar political point.” Rereading the paper, I find that this is mostly true. But the specter of Fanon haunts its pages nonetheless.\r\n\r\nOur conversation progression dealt with the importance of grammar and usage.2 On this theme we read Orwell’s “Politics and the English Language,” and I fell head over heels for his scathing condemnation of bad writing. The problem, of course, is that essays about style must have a joint influence on someone easily influenced in such matters; for me, this took the form of paralysis. I could hear Orwell whispering to me about the two qualities common to all bad writing: “The first is staleness of imagery; the other is lack of precision. The writer either has a meaning and cannot express it, or he inadvertently says something else” (Orwell 2). I would write a paragraph only to immediately witness the symptoms of the myriad diseases of slovenly writing and abandon it in despair.3 How humiliating, I thought, to write an essay about Orwell that displays all the “worn-out metaphors” (2), “pretentious diction” (3), and “meaningless words” (4) he expressly indicts! Even if the content of my paper displayed worshipful affection for his ideas, it was a bungled attempt at appreciation. Only the necessities of deadlines and impending evaluation saved me from swearing off writing altogether. George Bernard Shaw wrote that if something is worth doing, it is worth doing badly; in the end, I shrugged my shoulders and sat down to write.\r\n\r\nI can see these problems now and sigh over them, but I do comfort myself with the thought that being conscious of my tendency to espouse others’ ideas is a step toward developing my own. The writers I love do not people my mind in isolation; they are constantly conversing, finding unexpected common views, or engaging in spirited disagreement. Perhaps this sort of intellectual mishmash is no less productive than the pure, uncontaminated mental climate of genius and originality. And, of course, I am not alone in hearing other voices whenever I lift my pen: if so, indeed, I would be original in my very unoriginality. Perhaps the weight of past influence is necessary to any creative enterprise. Renowned critic Harold Bloom, in his introduction to <em>The Anxiety of Influence</em>, asserts that poetic history “is held to be indistinguishable from poetic influence, since strong poets make that history by misreading one another, so as to clear imaginative space for themselves” (Bloom 5). I am by no means a “strong poet,” and perhaps my very ease in absorbing others’ ideas makes it difficult for me to engage in productive “misreading,” but I share the belief that writing is never a solitary act, that to write even a line entails opening a dialogue with a vast existing body of texts. This is true of everyone, and to attempt to escape from it is both arrogant and futile. The important thing is to see that this endless mingling of ideas from across the centuries is not cause for discouragement or distress. Rather, the chance to converse with the multitude of preceding minds should arouse excited anticipation in every beginning writer.\r\n<h2> Notes</h2>\r\n1   In less insidious ways, I am still as enamored of Fanon as ever; reading his book formed my current academic ambition to explore post-colonial studies.\r\n2   My exhibit for the conversation essay was the ethics of translation. At one point I was going to include a remark in this essay about wondering whether my talents were better suited to translation than to creation, but in translating the few words from Proust above I was reminded that translation is only slightly more derivative than any other form of writing.\r\n3   “In light of the vast import of translational choices,” I wrote near the end of my essay, “literary translators must be certain to maintain ambiguity rather than erasing it when the original text demands it.” Let alone its grammatical oddness (“maintain” is opposed to “erasing,” and it is unclear how far the “when” clause extends), such a sentence—“in light of the vast import of”!—would merit censure from more lenient critics than Orwell.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'The Comfort of Influence', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'the-comfort-of-influence', '', '', '2012-03-23 15:56:20', '2012-03-23 15:56:20', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=246', 0, 'essay', '', 0),

(248, 5, '2011-12-19 07:27:55', '2011-12-19 07:27:55', 'I recently downloaded a podcast of a French radio program, “Époque,” and was listening to it one night a few weeks ago. The program was targeted at youth, executed and produced by youth, and centered around issues of political and social enfranchisement of young people in France—that is, from what I could understand. I am fluent in French; I attended an all-French immersion school for fifteen years, and read, speak and understand the language with relative ease. However, what I quickly realized was that the language on the program was not the French of my early education, nor was it the French of ten years ago when I lived with a French family in Paris for a month. More complex than simple slang or casual colloquialism, this sounded like an altogether different language, from which I could extricate meaning only through the brief contextual commentary offered by the older-sounding program host.\r\n\r\nWhat I was hearing was in fact an extremely new form of spoken French. Verlan, as it is called, is literally the phrase “à l’envers” (translation: backward) backward—a system of reversing the first and second half of a word and thus creating a new one. For instance, in verlan, the word “femme” (woman) becomes “meuf”; the word “arabe” (person of North African descent) becomes “beurre.” In verlan, almost every proper noun has been thus manipulated, and a simple sentence begins to sound a bit like gibberish to the unversed ear. Though a comparison to American Pig Latin would suggest a kind of obscure and short-lived early adolescent phase that many Americans once experienced, verlan is the ubiquitous language of French youth. It originated in the banlieus, or the suburban slums that surround major urban centers like Paris, as a kind of gang language, but in the last ten years it has spread to almost every corner of youth culture.\r\n\r\nVerlan is much more than a simple linguistic trend. It is both a social protest, as its origins in the slums would suggest, as well as a widespread resistance to the institutional conventions of the language itself. Verlan is a subversion of the otherwise rigid ordinances for French usage, as prescribed by the Académie française, a government body conceived in 1635 during the reign of King Louis XIII, and the single authority for the official French language. It sets the standards for language education nationwide, and its members, aptly named “The Immortals,” oversee all formal changes, additions and alterations to the official language, embodied in the Académie''s standard usage dictionary. The body’s intent was “to set down the French language, to give it rules, to render it pure and comprehensible for all”1 (“L’histoire”). For decades, the Académie française has attempted to maintain the “purity” of the language by resisting such trends as slang, or argot, as well as the Americanization of common parts of speech. Its excessive rigidity has drawn widespread scrutiny, but its lack of enforcement power has given it the status of archaic vestige at worst and cultural relic at best. Yet regardless of its seeming impotence on a large scale, the Académie française nevertheless represents an official government position on the institution of language, and as such, it has been at odds with the French people since its inception nearly four centuries ago.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, which lacks an institution similar to the Académie française, the debate over language has been framed by lexicographers and theorists such as David Foster Wallace, Steven Pinker, and George Orwell. These tend to fall into two main categories: Prescriptivists, who, in the vein of the Académie, adhere to stringent grammatical guidelines, and the Descriptivists, who believe that all forms of spoken language (by native speakers) are inherently correct, an argument that would seem to resonate with advocates of verlan. At first glance it would appear that the schism between the Académie and its young<em>résistants</em> is at heart a divide between traditionalist Prescriptivism and progressive Descriptivism. However, the nuances of the arguments by American lexicographers reveal a surprising paradox: Language exists as a tool for protest, but when the institution being resisted is the language itself, we must reexamine the terms of the debate.\r\n\r\nDavid Foster Wallace is a self-proclaimed Prescriptivist, albeit with a pragmatic philosophy. In his essay “Tense Present,” he contends that the conventions of a language are determined primarily by a desire to gain acceptance into a particular group, or Discourse Community:\r\n<blockquote>People really do “judge” one another according to their use of language. . . . [T]his judging involves acceptance, meaning not some touchy-feely emotional affirmation but actual acceptance or rejection of somebody’s bid to be regarded as a peer, a member of somebody else’s collective or community or Group. (50)</blockquote>\r\nThis argument is integral to the early development of verlan. Its earliest forms were intended as a language of exclusion, of subversion against the police, and of protest against established French society. The notion of a discourse community could not be felt more strongly than in the case where outsiders find the language completely impenetrable.\r\n\r\nHowever, Wallace goes further. He believes that a shared desire to be “taken seriously” is justification for the existence of a Standard Written English (SWE), or the standard language of the educated class. Though he supports the rights of various dialects to exist, he believes that this human impulse towards acceptance and respect by one’s peers motivates the widespread acceptance of SWE.\r\n\r\nLanguage theorist Steven Pinker challenges Wallace’s ideas as being classist; he sees SWE as a tool of a hierarchical system to instill social differentiation. In his essay “Grammar Puss,” he shows how linguistic trends in the eighteenth century supported the rise of the intellectual elite:\r\n<blockquote>Latin was considered the language of enlightenment and learning and it was offered as an ideal of precision and logic to which English should aspire. The period saw unprecedented social mobility, and anyone who wanted to distinguish himself as cultivated had to master the best version of English. . . . [T]he manuals tried to outdo one another by including greater numbers of increasingly fastidious rules that no refined person could afford to ignore. (2)</blockquote>\r\nBy this account, Pinker asserts that the Prescriptivist rules were instated in order to preserve a kind of upper-class elitism, resisting the trend of upward economic mobility of the lower classes that otherwise defined the time. These rules, when applied today, only reinforce this elitism, and thus emphasizing one dialect above all others cements the effects of social stratification.\r\n\r\nWhat’s more, Pinker shows how a collective aspiration toward “educated” speech debases the power of language as a political tool, especially by the common people. In his view, a person who uses language that does not meet the arbitrary standards of educated English will automatically be thought “ignorant of the rules, rather than challenging [them]” (3). By arguing, as Wallace does, that SWE exists as the only platform on which “serious” discourse can take place, language is denied the power to act as its own tool of protest. Alternative uses of language are rendered impotent.\r\n\r\nIn Pinker’s view, Wallace’s failing is that he believes everyone aspires to more or less the same Group: that of the educated class, those whose opinions are taken seriously. Pinker suggests that the standardization of language robs alternative forms of expression of their power to evoke resistance, protest, or criticism and merely reduces them to “ignorant” forms of communication. The young French-Algerian immigrant who decries police brutality in his own language, verlan, risks the credibility of his argument because of the arbitrary standards of the elitist Académie.\r\n\r\nIndeed the early development of verlan would seem to confirm Pinker’s views that “alternative” language can act as a political tool. Its conception was rooted in contempt for the French society that refused to take this group of people seriously. The dialect’s first words related primarily to drugs, guns, and gang violence, realities of the suburban slums, as well as to politically and socially disenfranchised groups such as North African immigrants (“beurres” for “arabes,” “kaïra” for “racaille,” or rabble) or racial signifiers (“renoi” for “noire,” or black). It was used to withhold meaning from figures of authority, namely the police, and quickly grew to the status of gang-speak.\r\n\r\nHowever, as verlan gained ground amongst youth culture at large, its focus shifted as well. Whereas it began as a language of self-identification for a marginalized demographic, it quickly morphed into a broad, generational war to reclaim the French language for its speakers. By the early 2000s, it was no longer the “exclusive” language of minorities or gangs, and as it spread through schoolyards and shopping malls, television and radio, it began to encompass a new attitude towards language as a whole. Language itself became the authority against which the protest was mobilized, itself transformed into the political battleground. French youth had revolted against a single oppressive figure: the centuries-old Académie française. They took everyday words—“mère,” “père,” “école,” “ami,” “voisin”—and literally reversed them, made everyday phrases convoluted, turned the traditional austerity of the French language into a joke. The once sleek and graceful phrases were made ugly and halting. And it made a statement. It was language turned back to its vulgar original—a language of commoners.\r\n\r\nWallace contends that the primary reason for standard language is to demonstrate respect for the listener. By using correct grammar, one saves the listener the extra effort of decipherment. Clearly, the point of verlan was the opposite: to demonstrate an open contempt for the institution of language and to debase it at its most fundamental level. Contrary to his argument that dialects can exist simultaneously and independently, verlan in fact rejects the legitimacy of all standardized language. Both Pinker and Wallace examine the contexts in which language is put to use over a political agenda, but what they have failed to acknowledge are the circumstances in which language is not at the service of a specific protest, but is itself being protested. Neither Prescriptive rigidity nor Descriptive inclusiveness could account for the violent reaction that sprang out of the suburbs and into the mouths of French teenagers nationwide. All language—the idea of language itself—was under fire.\r\n\r\nIt is ironic, based upon the progressive, near revolutionary precepts of verlan, that its strongest defense comes from a hardline Prescriptivist. In his essay “Politics and the English Language,” George Orwell argues against the misleading rhetoric and intentional vagueness of what he calls “ready-made” language, which is perpetuated by standardized language (and, presumably, institutions such as the Académie). The preconceived phrases of learned speakers, he says, flood our thoughts and corrode meaning. They create vagueness and imprecision and are used by the governing elite to mislead the uneducated, or those who are simply not interested in weeding through dense rhetoric. He argues for an active stance in the determination of one’s language, for choosing words that best express—rather than conceal or prevent—thought. “One can choose—not simply accept—the phrases that will best cover the meaning” (9). Verlan, at heart, is just this: a rejection of institutional and dispassionate language, a direct confrontation with the insincerity of politically correct and traditionalist ways of speaking. Orwell argues in favor of Prescriptivism only to the extent that it makes meaning clear; beyond that, he insists that the speaker must take an active and autonomous role in the formation of phrases.\r\n\r\nOrwell''s theories reveal a breakdown in the traditional division between Prescriptive and Descriptive language theory. Orwell argues that the most important element of grammatical Prescriptivism is clarity and sincerity; if anything, his is a kind of Prescriptivism for thought more than language. He advocates active language formation that excludes the “ready-made” phrase, which serves only to streamline and homogenize the kinds of ideas we discuss. Speakers (and writers) must exhibit freedom and autonomy in their language choices—and this, surprisingly, is a distinctly Descriptivist concept. By emphasizing the importance of individuals choosing their own language, Orwell reverses the sense of the terms Prescriptivism and Descriptivism. The fundamental tenets of Prescriptivism become an unwitting ally of the Descriptivist objective.\r\n\r\nIndividual choice is at the core of verlan’s power as a political tool. Linguistic agency reflects its speakers’ much-desired political agency. Verlan is used not merely to differentiate its speakers from the educated French elite, to establish its own Discourse Community, but rather to engage politically with the evolution of the language, as Orwell most adamantly suggests we should. Using verlan is not a social statement, and economic or racial statement, but a linguistic statement: an affirmation of autonomy and agency in language itself.\r\n\r\nAnd so the Académie française appears to be in a state of turmoil, if not on its way out altogether. The rigid prescriptions of standard French have existed since the seventeenth century, and today they have been almost entirely rejected by the new generation of French speakers. Yet I find it unlikely that the classical French language will disappear altogether. Verlan will, in my mind, soon join the status of dialect, shared by a generation of disillusioned youth. However, it is a potent reminder of the power of language that is developed in the most democratic of ways: by the people.\r\n<h2> Notes</h2>\r\n1 “La mission qui lui fut assignée dès l’origine était de fixer la langue française, de lui donner des règles, de la rendre pure et compréhensible par tous.”', 'The Usage Wars á l’Envers', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'the-usage-wars-a-lenvers', '', '', '2012-03-23 15:58:45', '2012-03-23 15:58:45', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=248', 0, 'essay', '', 0),

They took everyday words—“mère,” “père,” “école,” “ami,” “voisin”—and literally reversed them, made everyday phrases convoluted, turned the traditional austerity of the French language into a joke. The once sleek and graceful phrases were made ugly and halting. And it made a statement. It was language turned back to its vulgar original—a language of commoners.\n\nWallace contends that the primary reason for standard language is to demonstrate respect for the listener. By using correct grammar, one saves the listener the extra effort of decipherment. Clearly, the point of verlan was the opposite: to demonstrate an open contempt for the institution of language and to debase it at its most fundamental level. Contrary to his argument that dialects can exist simultaneously and independently, verlan in fact rejects the legitimacy of all standardized language. Both Pinker and Wallace examine the contexts in which language is put to use over a political agenda, but what they have failed to acknowledge are the circumstances in which language is not at the service of a specific protest, but is itself being protested. Neither Prescriptive rigidity nor Descriptive inclusiveness could account for the violent reaction that sprang out of the suburbs and into the mouths of French teenagers nationwide. All language—the idea of language itself—was under fire.\n\nIt is ironic, based upon the progressive, near revolutionary precepts of verlan, that its strongest defense comes from a hardline Prescriptivist. In his essay “Politics and the English Language,” George Orwell argues against the misleading rhetoric and intentional vagueness of what he calls “ready-made” language, which is perpetuated by standardized language (and, presumably, institutions such as the Académie). The preconceived phrases of learned speakers, he says, flood our thoughts and corrode meaning. They create vagueness and imprecision and are used by the governing elite to mislead the uneducated, or those who are simply not interested in weeding through dense rhetoric. He argues for an active stance in the determination of one’s language, for choosing words that best express—rather than conceal or prevent—thought. “One can choose—not simply accept—the phrases that will best cover the meaning” (9). Verlan, at heart, is just this: a rejection of institutional and dispassionate language, a direct confrontation with the insincerity of politically correct and traditionalist ways of speaking. Orwell argues in favor of Prescriptivism only to the extent that it makes meaning clear; beyond that, he insists that the speaker must take an active and autonomous role in the formation of phrases.\n\nOrwell''s theories reveal a breakdown in the traditional division between Prescriptive and Descriptive language theory. Orwell argues that the most important element of grammatical Prescriptivism is clarity and sincerity; if anything, his is a kind of Prescriptivism for thought more than language. He advocates active language formation that excludes the “ready-made” phrase, which serves only to streamline and homogenize the kinds of ideas we discuss. Speakers (and writers) must exhibit freedom and autonomy in their language choices—and this, surprisingly, is a distinctly Descriptivist concept. By emphasizing the importance of individuals choosing their own language, Orwell reverses the sense of the terms Prescriptivism and Descriptivism. The fundamental tenets of Prescriptivism become an unwitting ally of the Descriptivist objective.\n\nIndividual choice is at the core of verlan’s power as a political tool. Linguistic agency reflects its speakers’ much-desired political agency. Verlan is used not merely to differentiate its speakers from the educated French elite, to establish its own Discourse Community, but rather to engage politically with the evolution of the language, as Orwell most adamantly suggests we should. Using verlan is not a social statement, and economic or racial statement, but a linguistic statement: an affirmation of autonomy and agency in language itself.\n\nAnd so the Académie française appears to be in a state of turmoil, if not on its way out altogether. The rigid prescriptions of standard French have existed since the seventeenth century, and today they have been almost entirely rejected by the new generation of French speakers. Yet I find it unlikely that the classical French language will disappear altogether. Verlan will, in my mind, soon join the status of dialect, shared by a generation of disillusioned youth. However, it is a potent reminder of the power of language that is developed in the most democratic of ways: by the people.\n<h2> Notes</h2>\n1 “La mission qui lui fut assignée dès l’origine était de fixer la langue française, de lui donner des règles, de la rendre pure et compréhensible par tous.”\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWorks Cited\n\n“L''histoire.” Académie Française. &lt;http://www.academicfrancaise.fr/historie.index.html&gt;\nOrwell, George. “Politics and the English Language.” <em>Horizon</em> Apr. 1946.\nPinker, Steven. “Grammar Puss.” <em>The New Republic</em>. 21 Jan. 1994: 19-26\nWallace, David Foster. “Tense Present: Democracy, English, and the Wars Over Usage.” <em>Harper’s Magazine</em> Apr. 2001: 39-58', 'The Usage Wars á l’Envers', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '248-autosave', '', '', '2012-02-27 15:05:59', '2012-02-27 15:05:59', '', 248, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?p=249', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

(251, 5, '2011-12-19 07:30:02', '2011-12-19 07:30:02', 'The period between 1930 and 1950 represents a paradigm shift in Americans’ thinking about race and its status in public discourse. It was during this time that the prevailing ideology of the Reconstruction era—white supremacy—was overtaken by a new ideology of “color-blindness” or “race-neutrality.” Admittedly, it is unlikely that the average American at this time would have recognized this transformation. However, chances are good that if our average American was a magazine reader, he would have been exposed to the direct effects of this ideological shift through his reading of articles about jazz. Changes in the portrayal of jazz musicians in magazines from 1930 to 1950 are closely associated with concurrent changes in racial ideology. Whereas the explicitly racist discourse of magazine writers in the thirties reflects the poisonous ideology that dominated at the turn of the century, coverage from the forties partakes of the dominant “color-blind” ideology that continues to influence public discourse even today.\r\n\r\nThe 1930s marked the tail end of what historians have termed the “nadir of race relations” in the United States.1 This period, extending from roughly 1890 to 1940, marked the height of white oppression of African Americans after the abolition of slavery. The virulent racism of the Nadir was abetted by the spurious “science” of the eugenicists and social Darwinists who dominated the scientific discussion of race at the turn of the century. Race, according to these scientists, was a discrete, biological feature responsible for determining an individual’s intelligence, disposition, and sexual behavior (Omi 14). Scientifically unsound comparative studies of IQ allowed eugenicists to claim that European (and particularly Nordic) intellectual superiority over other races was genetic. Comparative studies of white and black physiology allowed social Darwinists to suggest that whites were more evolved than other races (Sitkoff 191). Taking their cue from their colleagues in the sciences, historians set about the task of rewriting history to adequately reflect the supposed superiority of the white race.\r\n\r\nParadoxically, it was during the Nadir, when defenders of white supremacy were resorting to scholarly acrobatics to avoid attributing anything of cultural value to blacks, that jazz first became popular with white Americans. In the Roaring Twenties, jazz’s origins in the African American community only increased its appeal, if not for the nation’s conservative cultural critics then for a younger generation of white Americans. They regarded jazz as emblematic of rebellion against the staid cultural mores of the older generation. That jazz was played by black musicians in illegal speakeasies and allowed for “close” (that is, sexual) dancing made it seem all the more exotic and transgressive.\r\n\r\nBy the 1930s, jazz’s transgressive appeal had been mitigated by Swing music’s admittance into the white mainstream. Band leaders such as Duke Ellington and Fletcher Henderson popularized swing in performances at urban nightclubs and large dance halls which, in the South at least, were segregated. The musicians themselves, however, were both white and black, with black band leaders such as Ellington and Count Basie enjoying at least as much success as white band leaders like Benny Goodman. Indeed, Louis Armstrong, the most celebrated and recognized Swing musician of that era, was African American.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that magazines covered jazz in the years prior to 1930, it was to denigrate it and the musicians who played it in the explicitly racist rhetoric characteristic of the Nadir. As Maureen Anderson points out in her article “The White Reception of Jazz in America,” mainstream critiques cast jazz as the music of primitive and crude savages, dangerous because it encouraged listeners to revert to their animalistic instincts. As a critic in <em>Literary Digest </em>wrote in 1917, “The groups that play for dancing, when colored, seem infected with the virus that they try to instill as a stimulus in others” (qtd. in Anderson 136). A writer for <em>Current Opinion</em> in 1919 continued the assault on the jazz musician when he wrote of musician Jasbo Brown that, “when he imbibed freely of gin, which was his favorite pastime, he had a way of screaming above the melody with a strange barbaric abandon” (qtd. in Anderson 140).\r\n\r\nJournalists in the 1930s, though generally more positive towards jazz and jazz musicians, nevertheless continued to partake of this racist discourse, though it could be argued their racism was of a more subtle variety than that of their predecessors. Nadir-era rhetoric was now deployed under the pretense of objectively “explaining” jazz to readers or else was dismissed as “all in good fun.” The authors of “Hot Jazz Jargon,” published in <em>Vanity Fair</em> in 1935, for example, offer readers a racist assessment of jazz music and jazz musicians under the guise of explaining jazz jargon. Another <em>Vanity Fair</em> article of the same year, entitled “Louis Armstrong,” is written entirely in an affected “black” dialect that author Hermann Deutsch evidently intended readers to find humorous. The article is billed as “semi-fiction” and loosely relates the circumstances of Louis Armstrong’s boyhood in New Orleans. The opening lines set the tone for the entire piece: “Hayah pappy! Hayah mammy! Hayah de gal chillen and de boy chillen all both!” Deutsch recognizes that Armstrong, a black musician in Jim Crow America, plays to audiences in the South that are entirely white, a fact that he seems to interpret as a bellwether of racial change: “White folks in de white light—Black folks in de black light—All but Louis Armstrong—He in de white light too, now. It ain’t like it useter be, brudders and sisters1” (70). Of course, the great irony is that the very existence of this offensive article delineates the very real limits within which Armstrong was forced to work.\r\n\r\n<em>Esquire</em>’s fictional “Impossible Interview” of the next year uses dialect to similar effect. The “interview,” a regular feature in <em>Esquire</em>, pitted two cultural icons against each other in a fictional discussion. In this case, Louis Armstrong stands opposite the popular white classical violinist Fritz Kreisler. There is no doubt that the contrast between Armstrong’s dialect and Kreisler’s normative English was intended to be comical, though it branded Armstrong as the uneducated one in the debate. However, the attitude of the author toward jazz musicians in general might be construed as positive; with encouragement from Louis, Fritz begins to “swing” “The Moonlight Sonata” and declares: “Maybe there’s something to this swing business after all” (“Impossible 33). The author suggests white musicians might learn something from black jazz musicians, but he seems also to imply that jazz is legitimated only by white approval. Armstrong is portrayed as a grinning, happy-go-lucky, Uncle Tom who, in declaring “I don’ wanna be in no symphony. I wanna swing,” betrays a lack of sophistication and an inability to appreciate forms of “high art” (“Impossible” 33).\r\n\r\nNadir-era racism was already on its way out by the 1930s. Criticism of the eugenicists’ and social Darwinists’ conception of race came from a group of social scientists headed by the eminent American anthropologist Franz Boas. How did anthropologists become caught up in a debate heretofore dominated by biologists? The historian Peggy Pascoe offers an explanation:\r\n<blockquote>[F]or social scientists, the attack on racialism was not so much an end in itself as a function of a larger goal of establishing “culture” as a central social science paradigm. Intellectually and institutionally, Boas and his followers staked their claim to academic authority on their conviction that human difference and human history were best explained by culture.” (53)</blockquote>\r\nSocial scientists began their assault by refuting the claim that race was a discrete biological characteristic. The claims of scientific racism had rested on the biological purity of racial categories, but Nadir-era scientists had failed to arrive at a comprehensive list of discrete races. In fact, the number of identified races had continued to mushroom over the course of the nineteenth century as new categories were created to accommodate exceptions to the pre-existing metric. Social scientists exploited this weakness. The fact that, throughout history, people of differing ancestry had crossed paths and procreated, Boas pointed out, made the idea of discrete racial categories patently ridiculous. Finally, in a series of groundbreaking studies, Boas, Aldous Huxley, Lancelot Hogben, and Theodore Dobzhansky proved the degree of genetic variation within and between races to be roughly comparable (Sitkoff 193-4).\r\n\r\nOther studies attacked claims that whites were both more evolved and more intelligent then blacks. The social Darwinists’ assertion that physical differences—for example, in hair texture and degree of jaw protrusion—between whites and blacks indicated that whites had progressed further evolutionarily, was upset by a study reinterpreting the same data to indicate black evolutionary superiority. Psychologist Otto Klineberg’s IQ studies undercut social Darwinists’ claims about white inborn intellectual superiority. The IQ test, his studies concluded, did not actually measure inborn intelligence. Rather, higher scores correlated with higher education levels and high socioeconomic status. Only a cultural explanation of intelligence, Klineberg argued, could account for the fact that blacks in the North often outscored whites in the South on IQ tests (Sitkoff 191-2).\r\n\r\nBy the late 1940s, the popular conception of race had been so radically undercut that many intellectuals were calling for race to be banned from public discourse entirely. In a 1941 issue of the<em> Journal of Heredity</em>, British anthropologist Ashley Montagu argued that race should be abandoned for the following reasons:\r\n<blockquote>(1) that it is artificial; (2) that it does not agree with the facts; (3) that it leads to confusion and perpetuation of error, and finally that for all these reasons it is meaningless or rather more accurately such meaning as it possesses is false. Being so weighted down with false meaning it were better that the term be dropped than that any attempt should be made to give it new meaning.” (qtd. In Sitkoff 191)</blockquote>\r\nEven biologists seemed to agree. Julian Huxley wrote that “the question begging term race [should] be banished . . . from all discussion of human affairs” (qtd. In Sitkoff 191).\r\n\r\nColor-blindness was born out of this desire to relegate race to the sidelines of public discourse. It encouraged Americans to ignore or at least de-emphasize race as a significant factor in people’s lives. Race might still have been a problem, but it was a problem with a built-in solution: the success that Irish and Jewish immigrants had had in assimilating into mainstream American culture would, many Americans felt, inevitably be repeated by African Americans. Slavery had set them back in this process, but that roadblock had since been removed. All that was left for Americans to do to facilitate black assimilation into the normative culture was to ignore race and let the problem solve itself. Needless to say, the shift toward a color-blind ideology did<em> not</em> represent a wholesale abandonment of the idea of race. As Jon Panish explains, “The not-so-subtle message encoded in color-blindness . . . is that white and black Americans should begin to move away from the stigmatized category of blackness to the privileged, unmarked category of whiteness” (6).\r\n\r\nColor-blind discourse began to emerge in mainstream magazine coverage of jazz in the years after WWII. By this time, Swing could no longer claim the undivided attention of the press; Bebop was taking over. A new avant-garde style of jazz pioneered by a younger generation of musicians, Bebop was largely a response to what musicians criticized as the “sticky” sweetness of popular Swing music. Developed during after-hours jam sessions at Minton’s jazz club in Harlem, it was fast, frenetic, incorporated unusual new harmonies, and often had no discernible melody. Trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie and saxophonist Charlie Parker were Bebop’s primary innovators, but it was Dizzy who became the ambassador of Bop in the mainstream magazine press. Richard O. Boyer’s use of color-blind discourse in <em>The New Yorker</em>’s July 1948 profile of Dizzy is marked. He reports that Dizzy’s fans, “both white and black” describe him adoringly using the same, characteristically “bop” slang. Dizzy, they say, is “real crazy,” “a bitch,” and “a killer” (28). Boyer associates black jazz musicians and their black fans with cultural movements revered by <em>The New Yorker</em>’s intellectual, and mostly white, readership. “Many of the Negro adherents of bebop” he writes, “take a subsidiary interest in psychoanalysis and abstract art” (28). When musicians have received formal musical training, Boyer mentions it. In fact, he continually offers up an image of the jazz musician as a thoughtful intellectual, someone with whom <em>New Yorker </em>readers might presumably identify. He describes the Bop pianist Thelonious Monk as “scholarly” and quotes him as saying “We [Bop musicians] liked Ravel, Stravinsky, Debussy, Prokofieff, Schoenberg, and maybe we were a little influenced by them” (30). He attempts to offset the popular stereotype that bop music was fueled by jazz musicians’ drug habits, emphasizing Gillespie collaborator Gil Fuller’s “impeccable morals” and relaying Fuller’s view that claims of drug use were “a gross and gratuitous libel” (29).\r\n\r\nWhen a discussion of the racism Jazz musicians faced becomes unavoidable, Boyer’s language becomes either vague or light and dismissive. He notes, for example, that “many Negro boppers like to pretend that they are Arabs,” assuming Arab-sounding names and wearing turbans. Thelonious Monk, he says, “sometimes forgets that he was born of West Sixty-Third Street and announces that he is a native of Damascus” (31). His joking tone trivializes what he clearly recognizes as an attempt by black jazz musicians to escape the racism to which they were regularly subjected. When he reveals that Dizzy dons a turban from time to time when abroad, he speaks of him “[appreciating] this flight from harsh reality,” (31) leaving readers to infer just what the nature of Dizzy’s reality might be. He goes on to attribute the Islamic conversions of many boppers to a desire to escape what he vaguely calls “their American environment” (31).\r\n\r\nThat intellectuals at <em>The New Yorker</em> would be responsive to color-blind discourse may not be surprising, but this same gesture is discernible in <em>Life</em>’s photo essay of a few months later. A series of thirteen glossy photos, appearing in the magazine’s regular feature “<em>Life</em> Goes to a Party” document what readers are led to believe constitute the scenes of Dizzy Gillespie’s everyday life. In one, Dizzy jams with other jazz musicians, including the white pianist Mel Powell. In another, he signs publicity shots for white female fans who, in imitation of him, wear blue berets, thick-framed black glasses, and fake goatees. Shots taken at Billy Berg’s Hollywood nightclub show the popular white singer Mel Tormé and actress Ava Gardner (wearing her own beret, glasses, and fake beard) enjoying Dizzy’s show and socializing with the musician. One cannot imagine a more compelling illustration of mainstream white approval of the black jazz musician.\r\n\r\nHowever much magazine writers or photojournalists partook of color-blind discourse, it was not enough to fully overcome their opposing tendency to “otherize” black jazz artists. Bop musicians were too often portrayed one-dimensionally as adherents of an exotic and entertainingly coded subculture. The role of the white magazine writer was to interpret, often humorously, the curious behavior of the beboppers for their white readership. In the <em>Life</em> photo essay, for example, a series of four photographs illustrates the “Bebop Greeting.” The first photo depicts Dizzy and fellow musician Benny Carter greeting each other with what the caption explains are typical bop salutations: “Bells, man! Where you been?” Next they flash “the flatted fifth” hand signal (which the author explains is a note common in bebop), and shout “Eel-ya-dah!” (in imitation of bebop triplet notes), before finally gripping one another’s hands in the last panel. The caption wryly explains that it is only after completing this “ritual” that beboppers can “converse” (139). With an air of theatricality, the author refers to Dizzy’s beret, glasses, and rumpled suit as “the boppers’ required costume” (139). Musicians’ Islamic beliefs function as another entertaining aspect of their subculture, necessitating yet another set of complex rituals exotic to white readers. A photo depicts Gillespie (who was not actually Muslim but Bahá’í) at home in his Hollywood apartment bowing prostrate towards Mecca. The caption explains that beboppers who have converted to Islam often “interrupt rehearsals at sunset to bow to the east (142).\r\n\r\nThus while magazine articles about jazz musicians during the period 1930 to 1950 show a distinct trend away from the racial discourse of the Nadir to the color-blind discourse of the 1940s, this does not mean racial discourse was abandoned. There remained a tendency to exoticize the jazz musician—to emphasize rather than downplay racial difference. In articles that self-consciously adopt the discourse of color-blindness, the importance of race is felt in its absence. It is the thing <em>not</em>spoken about. Race in these articles emerges as significant only insofar as it serves the interests of the white magazine writer to have it do so.\r\n\r\nThat the oppositional tendencies to downplay and exoticize race could exist side by side in articles about jazz should come as no surprise, as these impulses continue to characterize our modern discourse. What, after all, is “political correctness” if not a kind of color-blindness? If magazine writers in the 1940s adopted color-blindness because they believed, like so many white Americans, in the inevitability of assimilation, they have remained so today because to discuss racial difference would be to concede that it cannot yet be relegated to history. In spite of the persistence of color-blind discourse, however, the American mass media continues to exoticize the black musician. Just as white Americans in the twenties were captivated by the transgressive black jazz artist who inhabited the exotic world of Harlem speakeasies, white Americans today are transfixed by the black rap artist, evoked in the popular imagination as a streetwise hustler negotiating the urban ghetto. In this tendency towards the simultaneous diminution and amplification of race, the limits of color-blindness as an ideology are laid bare. After almost seven decades of operating within these limits, perhaps it is time for a new generation of Americans to ask whether it will continue to do so.\r\n<h2> Notes</h2>\r\n1 The Nadir was first defined by the historian Rayford W.

(253, 5, '2011-12-19 07:31:24', '2011-12-19 07:31:24', 'Designed to fill the gap in the Manhattan skyline left by the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the original design of Freedom Tower, unveiled in late 2003, was inevitably invested with symbolic significance. Freedom Tower was meant to mark the re-emergence of innovative American architecture; its chief architect, David Childs, wanted the building to “demonstrate that American thinking and construction can compare with the best new examples in Europe, Asia and elsewhere” (Lacayo). These expectations and ambitions made it all the more shocking when architect Thomas Shine accused Childs and his firm, Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM), of copyright infringement.\r\n\r\nOf course, copyright protection implies that there is property to protect, and moreover, that someone has ownership of that piece of intellectual property. Because the purpose of American copyright law is to encourage progress, the assumption is that ownership of designs will give architects incentive to create increasingly efficient and visually-pleasing buildings. But this copyright paradigm has not always existed in the field of architecture. The Architectural Works Copyright Protection Act (AWCP), which Shine invoked, did not come into being until 1990. And it is far from certain whether protecting claims to ownership in architecture will help or hinder the future of the built environment. This, then, seems to be the question at the heart of the recent Freedom Tower dispute: does granting ownership serve progress? The Freedom Tower controversy may shed some light on how the question is discussed today, how the current paradigm fits into larger historical trends in architecture, and how valid it might be to protect architects’ claims to ownership.\r\n\r\nShine made his claim public in November 2004 when he charged Childs and SOM of plagiarism. In a suit under the AWCP Act, Shine argued that as an architecture master’s student in 1999, he presented a project titled “Olympic Tower” to Childs, who was on the review panel for the class. Olympic Tower featured a tapering top and twisting body that was wrapped in an exterior structure with a repeating diamond-shaped motif. When Shine saw a similar combination of these elements in Childs’ version of Freedom Tower in 2003, he smelled a rat; shortly after, he copyrighted his student project and sued Childs for infringement (Brown). A brief struggle over the legitimacy of the lawsuit ensued, with SOM asserting that the elements in Olympic Tower were in fact not original and hence ineligible for copyright protection. However, the court ruled that a lay observer “might find that the Freedom Tower’s twisting shape and undulating diamond-shaped façade make it substantially similar to Olympic Tower” (Judge Michael B. Mukasey quoted in “Architect’s lawsuit”).\r\n\r\nBut exactly what about the tower’s “design” was in dispute? And what part of the design was being protected by copyright? We may gain insight into the contours of the debate by looking at the rhetoric, which on first inspection suggests that it is the individual design features that were in question. Shine’s argument centered on the suspicious replication in Childs’ proposal of the distinctive elements which characterized his Olympic Tower. Newspaper reports on the infringement case broke down the architectural design into discrete copied elements and enumerated the “twisting surfaces,” “diagonal exterior grid” and “other similarities” (“Architect sues”). The language suggests that such design elements are like Lego components; Shine’s position was that each block in Freedom Tower was copied from his own skyscraper. Childs and SOM defended their position in similarly reductive terms, claiming that “most of these elements have been industry standards for decades” (SOM spokesperson Elizabeth Kubany quoted in “Architect sues”). If the parts that make up Olympic Tower are ineligible for copyright protection, SOM argued, then so is the design of Olympic Tower itself. What really appears to be at the heart of the case is the appropriation of the tapering, twisting and exterior grids en masse. It was not just the individual reappearance of these elements that startled Shine, but the copying of his own particular way of assembling these features.\r\n\r\nBut why is it significant that the legal conflict should be drawn over the arrangement of elements into a whole and not the elements themselves? In architecture, the overall composition of a building is of primary importance as far as the observer’s experience is concerned. According to journalist Clay Risen, we appreciate architecture “holistically.” “The vast majority of people, inside and out of the profession judge a building by the sum of its parts to the near exclusion of its individual elements,” Risen asserts. If we do, indeed, see first and foremost the overall concept and character of a building, then there may be some credence to the view that Childs’ design was suspiciously close to Shine’s student project in its particular combination of architectural forms. The court that ruled on the case used a holistic approach, judging how average people would perceive similarity and difference according to a “total concept and feel” test (Brown). Although cultural progress is the goal of copyright, the court ruling suggests that progress can be made by simply rearranging external features of the design.\r\n\r\nFordham University law professor Raphael Winick argues for the equation of progress with rearrangement when she writes that architectural progress “consists of appropriating elements from the architectural vocabulary, and rearranging them in a more useful or more aesthetically pleasing way” (1605). Originality and innovation manifest themselves in the very combination of elements that Shine supposedly created, Childs purportedly stole, and copyright law is meant to be protecting. Winick writes that appropriation of existing design elements, such as the twisting façade and exterior diagonal trusses,“is absolutely essential” (1604) for the profession, but she would likely argue that the wholesale repetition of a particular arrangement of elements would be antithetical to progress. Winick does acknowledge that “The incremental innovation that can transform art may be very slow and subtle,” and that “small alterations in a previous design may constitute a significant utilitarian or aesthetic advance” (1605). However, by “small alterations,” she appears to imply the introduction of some heretofore foreign element into a new context; she gives the example of the surprising and bold addition of a broken pediment, usually found on top of grandfather clocks, to the AT&amp;T building in New York (1605). Simply placing Olympic Tower’s torqued body, tapering crown and triangular trusswork in the novel context of ground zero would not qualify as any functional or aesthetic advancement, as Winick’s idea of a “small alteration” seems to mean a quite substantial addition to the design.\r\n\r\nWinick’s contention that architectural evolution may be slow was embraced by old masters such as Mies van der Rohe, who reportedly said, “I don’t want to be original, I want to be good” (quoted in Rybczynski). Mies, like Winick, recognized that architectural ideas had to be refined instead of created anew. But there is a key difference between Mies’s position and Winick’s: Mies would have probably approved of miniscule changes to the previous design, whereas Winick calls for design elements to be reshuffled, if only subtly. Instead of constantly producing new arrangements, existing ones ought to be returned to over and over again and tweaked to near perfection. Perhaps architectural advancement is not achieved by adding or taking away features from a certain combination—as you would introduce new blocks to a Lego construction—but by slightly altering the design’s whole, even if the basic elements are kept intact. This possibility seems to be one that current architectural copyright law has overlooked. One only has to consider how the Freedom Tower controversy was debated to see that legal practice operates on Winick’s rather narrow assumption of progress and not Mies’ more open one.\r\n\r\nClearly there has been a shift in what constitutes architectural progress, and copyright law has developed in response to the times. To determine how valid the recent legal claims to ownership are, we need to look beyond our current epoch and see how architecture has worked historically. <em>Slate</em> architecture critic Witold Rybczynski writes that “For most of the last 500 years, imitation was the sincerest form of architectural flattery.” Renaissance architects imitated ancient styles and gladly borrowed from and even depended on the work of their contemporaries. The profession was therefore a collaborative pursuit in which “ideas bounced back and forth, gathering momentum in the process” (Rybczynski). This unembarrassed reliance on previous works meant that no single “author”—so far as there could be one—owned the ideas. Even in the early 20th century when “pioneers such as Mies van der Rohe made discoveries, they belonged to everyone; it was a sign of esteem when other architects copied.” Now, however, we live in a moment “in which originality is valued above all” (Rybczynski). Clay Risen theorizes that postmodernism, with its rejection of dominant aesthetic rules, is to blame. Risen explains that ever since the advent of postmodernism in 1950s, we have had what he calls an “anti-paradigm” in which there is no “single, definable, ruling aesthetic,” only the aesthetic of difference. The result is that “each architect, rather than building off others in the formation and perfection of a particular aesthetic, is supposed to develop his or her own aesthetic to the near exclusion of everyone else.” Unlike the “International Style” of Mies’ era in which largely derivative steel and glass office towers swept cityscapes around the world, the emphasis today is on anarchic uniqueness. Suddenly, influence is out of fashion and fierce independence and originality is in vogue.\r\n\r\nBut fashion does not always reflect the facts; no matter what the current trends, today’s architects are still very much influenced by the past and still rely heavily on creative exchange and collaboration. If anything, modern-day projects are more technically complex, requiring not only additional engineers but an entire hierarchy of designers who migrate from one firm to the next, taking others’ ideas with them. Amidst this hubbub of interaction and influence, the “romantic image of the solitary genius,” as journalist Fred Bernstein calls it, can only be a myth, for “an architect cannot but be influenced by images seen and remembered” (Giovannini). When Shine was a student working on Olympic Tower, surely myriad influences from his colleagues and professors were at work on him, and it is likely that he influenced others, including Childs. Even if there is no formal contact between architects, there is still that thing called the zeitgeist. Robert A. M. Stern, dean of the architecture school that Shine attended, describes it as such: “In any given moment…things are in the air. So people in different parts of the world often come to very similar solutions” (quoted in Dunlap). Shine and Childs probably tweaked and toyed with the same design solutions, bouncing ideas off of each other like all other architects present and past.\r\n\r\nThe trouble with our obsession with originality today is that it “distorts the creative process” (Rybczynski) which is necessarily characterized by this cauldron of collaboration, exchange and influence. Today’s skewed conception of good architecture shifts the focus away from improving the built environment through refining a design. Instead, ambitious architects are pressured to cultivate their idiosyncratic style. Perhaps this emphasis on the importance of being an original thinker led Shine to file for infringement. Had attitudes about architecture been different, the case may never have arisen, and architectural copyright law may not be practiced today as frequently and restrictively. Of course, the very existence of the 1990 AWCP Act is a product of our mode of thinking about the architectural profession of late.\r\n\r\nBut the act of codifying current attitudes into law may also reinforce them. Professor of architecture Robert Greenstreet has conjectured that fear of litigation may lead to a “design-to-be-different” strategy. The result would be a dystopian landscape of utter visual discord; the AWCP Act might prevent individual buildings from “creating visual harmony with existing surroundings” (Greenstreet and Klingaman 182). More generally, Rybczynski fears that the “architectural conversations” that are so crucial to the creative process may cease and that “the process of architectural evolution may grind to a halt as architects are forced to start from scratch each time they approach a project” (Risen). This seems to be only one step away from Shine’s claiming legal ownership to his particular arrangement of taper, twist and trusswork and then suing Childs for not being original enough.\r\n\r\nGiven these grim prospects for the future, it could very well be that our current copyright paradigm is based on a misreading of the architectural creative process, that it is not doing justice to the complex question of ownership, and that by legalizing ownership it is stifling the profession’s vitality. Borrowing and influencing, consciously or not, has long been an essential, at times even institutionalized, part of building design. One might even say these are among the timeless ingredients for architectural evolution. Only in recent decades has such influence become scandalous. Granted Childs’ Freedom Tower may have been strikingly “unoriginal,” but perhaps this close similarity—a resemblance that borders on what some might call “plagiarism”—is what actually drives progress in architectural design. Originality, enforced by our current copyright laws, may have the opposite effect and could wreck the built environment. This possibility should make us rethink copyright protection and its place in architecture. To grant copyright is essentially to confer ownership, with all the risks of choking a profession that depends on the free exchange of ideas.\r\n<h2> Appendix</h2>\r\n[caption id="attachment_340" align="alignright" width="600" caption="Figure 1"]<img class="size-full wp-image-340 " title="Figure 1" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Ng_11.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="600" height="381" />[/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_341" align="alignright" width="450" caption="Figure 2"]<img class="size-full wp-image-341 " title="Figure 2" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Ng_21.jpg" alt="Figure 2" width="450" height="461" />[/caption]', 'Who Owns Architecture?

(254, 8, '2012-03-01 16:26:26', '2012-03-01 16:26:26', 'Designed to fill the gap in the Manhattan skyline left by the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the original design of Freedom Tower, unveiled in late 2003, was inevitably invested with symbolic significance. Freedom Tower was meant to mark the re-emergence of innovative American architecture; its chief architect, David Childs, wanted the building to “demonstrate that American thinking and construction can compare with the best new examples in Europe, Asia and elsewhere” (Lacayo). These expectations and ambitions made it all the more shocking when architect Thomas Shine accused Childs and his firm, Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM), of copyright infringement.\r\n\r\nOf course, copyright protection implies that there is property to protect, and moreover, that someone has ownership of that piece of intellectual property. Because the purpose of American copyright law is to encourage progress, the assumption is that ownership of designs will give architects incentive to create increasingly efficient and visually-pleasing buildings. But this copyright paradigm has not always existed in the field of architecture. The Architectural Works Copyright Protection Act (AWCP), which Shine invoked, did not come into being until 1990. And it is far from certain whether protecting claims to ownership in architecture will help or hinder the future of the built environment. This, then, seems to be the question at the heart of the recent Freedom Tower dispute: does granting ownership serve progress? The Freedom Tower controversy may shed some light on how the question is discussed today, how the current paradigm fits into larger historical trends in architecture, and how valid it might be to protect architects’ claims to ownership.\r\n\r\nShine made his claim public in November 2004 when he charged Childs and SOM of plagiarism. In a suit under the AWCP Act, Shine argued that as an architecture master’s student in 1999, he presented a project titled “Olympic Tower” to Childs, who was on the review panel for the class. Olympic Tower featured a tapering top and twisting body that was wrapped in an exterior structure with a repeating diamond-shaped motif. When Shine saw a similar combination of these elements in Childs’ version of Freedom Tower in 2003, he smelled a rat; shortly after, he copyrighted his student project and sued Childs for infringement (Brown). A brief struggle over the legitimacy of the lawsuit ensued, with SOM asserting that the elements in Olympic Tower were in fact not original and hence ineligible for copyright protection. However, the court ruled that a lay observer “might find that the Freedom Tower’s twisting shape and undulating diamond-shaped façade make it substantially similar to Olympic Tower” (Judge Michael B. Mukasey quoted in “Architect’s lawsuit”).\r\n\r\nBut exactly what about the tower’s “design” was in dispute? And what part of the design was being protected by copyright? We may gain insight into the contours of the debate by looking at the rhetoric, which on first inspection suggests that it is the individual design features that were in question. Shine’s argument centered on the suspicious replication in Childs’ proposal of the distinctive elements which characterized his Olympic Tower. Newspaper reports on the infringement case broke down the architectural design into discrete copied elements and enumerated the “twisting surfaces,” “diagonal exterior grid” and “other similarities” (“Architect sues”). The language suggests that such design elements are like Lego components; Shine’s position was that each block in Freedom Tower was copied from his own skyscraper. Childs and SOM defended their position in similarly reductive terms, claiming that “most of these elements have been industry standards for decades” (SOM spokesperson Elizabeth Kubany quoted in “Architect sues”). If the parts that make up Olympic Tower are ineligible for copyright protection, SOM argued, then so is the design of Olympic Tower itself. What really appears to be at the heart of the case is the appropriation of the tapering, twisting and exterior grids en masse. It was not just the individual reappearance of these elements that startled Shine, but the copying of his own particular way of assembling these features.\r\n\r\nBut why is it significant that the legal conflict should be drawn over the arrangement of elements into a whole and not the elements themselves? In architecture, the overall composition of a building is of primary importance as far as the observer’s experience is concerned. According to journalist Clay Risen, we appreciate architecture “holistically.” “The vast majority of people, inside and out of the profession judge a building by the sum of its parts to the near exclusion of its individual elements,” Risen asserts. If we do, indeed, see first and foremost the overall concept and character of a building, then there may be some credence to the view that Childs’ design was suspiciously close to Shine’s student project in its particular combination of architectural forms. The court that ruled on the case used a holistic approach, judging how average people would perceive similarity and difference according to a “total concept and feel” test (Brown). Although cultural progress is the goal of copyright, the court ruling suggests that progress can be made by simply rearranging external features of the design.\r\n\r\nFordham University law professor Raphael Winick argues for the equation of progress with rearrangement when she writes that architectural progress “consists of appropriating elements from the architectural vocabulary, and rearranging them in a more useful or more aesthetically pleasing way” (1605). Originality and innovation manifest themselves in the very combination of elements that Shine supposedly created, Childs purportedly stole, and copyright law is meant to be protecting. Winick writes that appropriation of existing design elements, such as the twisting façade and exterior diagonal trusses,“is absolutely essential” (1604) for the profession, but she would likely argue that the wholesale repetition of a particular arrangement of elements would be antithetical to progress. Winick does acknowledge that “The incremental innovation that can transform art may be very slow and subtle,” and that “small alterations in a previous design may constitute a significant utilitarian or aesthetic advance” (1605). However, by “small alterations,” she appears to imply the introduction of some heretofore foreign element into a new context; she gives the example of the surprising and bold addition of a broken pediment, usually found on top of grandfather clocks, to the AT&amp;T building in New York (1605). Simply placing Olympic Tower’s torqued body, tapering crown and triangular trusswork in the novel context of ground zero would not qualify as any functional or aesthetic advancement, as Winick’s idea of a “small alteration” seems to mean a quite substantial addition to the design.\r\n\r\nWinick’s contention that architectural evolution may be slow was embraced by old masters such as Mies van der Rohe, who reportedly said, “I don’t want to be original, I want to be good” (quoted in Rybczynski). Mies, like Winick, recognized that architectural ideas had to be refined instead of created anew. But there is a key difference between Mies’s position and Winick’s: Mies would have probably approved of miniscule changes to the previous design, whereas Winick calls for design elements to be reshuffled, if only subtly. Instead of constantly producing new arrangements, existing ones ought to be returned to over and over again and tweaked to near perfection. Perhaps architectural advancement is not achieved by adding or taking away features from a certain combination—as you would introduce new blocks to a Lego construction—but by slightly altering the design’s whole, even if the basic elements are kept intact. This possibility seems to be one that current architectural copyright law has overlooked. One only has to consider how the Freedom Tower controversy was debated to see that legal practice operates on Winick’s rather narrow assumption of progress and not Mies’ more open one.\r\n\r\nClearly there has been a shift in what constitutes architectural progress, and copyright law has developed in response to the times.

Beside the plates was my hand, lingering in the lukewarm water that had yet to drain, and my watch, still clasped around my wrist, reminded me that I had been standing there for about fifteen minutes, unflinching.\r\n\r\nWith a quick jolt, I finished cleaning the dishes, and when they were washed I continued to scrub the sink clean for about ten minutes, and then I figured that I should take out the trash, and after I did, instead of heading back up to my apartment, I continued on from my building’s service entrance to the local Japanese restaurant down the street, where I had a bowl of chicken katsudon and, while eating, I decided to go find the most eco-friendly kind of kitty litter for my cat, and later, with a bag of said litter in hand, I returned to my apartment to find that the floors looked a little dirty in the afternoon light, so I got out the dry mop and went about cleaning the wood floors until I could just make out the reflection of the snow falling outside my window, which reminded me that the bathroom needed to be disinfected.\r\n\r\nTheodor Adorno once said in his own reflection on the process of writing that in “his text, the writer sets up house. Just as he trundles through papers, books, pencils, documents untidily from room to room, he creates the same disorder in his thoughts” (86). When I am preparing to write, the exact opposite happens, for I cannot stand feeling like I have a muddled mind when getting down to the business of thinking. I need order inside my head, and when all is in order, I feel ready. Since I can’t easily clean each indefinable corner of my consciousness, the dishes generally seem like a good place to start. By participating in the upkeep of my home, I am not just cleaning up the mess that is around me; I am beginning a therapeutic procedure of self-organization. Managing what immediately surrounds me helps me manage my thoughts. But alongside the need for orderliness, there is also a sprinkle of uneasiness involved, and that can account for the random episodes of blank stares and all-around avoidance of the inevitable work that lies ahead.\r\n\r\nEven after running my hodgepodge of errands and anything else I could think of doing before I ran out of excuses, it still took me another four hours to find, finally, the courage to sit down and start typing, and even when I did, as expected, the first hundred or so words I wrote were eventually discarded. That which was not thrown out was rearranged.\r\n\r\nI constantly seek clarity when the words come together on my page, and I anticipate that my reader will expect no less than a level and carefully-structured written progression that accurately represents my thoughts. Writing, for one who cares deeply about the results of his or her approach to a composition, can be a torrent of torment. The anticipation of crafting a lucid page haunts me, and so I put it off for as long as I can.\r\nJust beginning to compose a single sentence can be the hardest part of the process. For a writer, the ultimate challenge is to ease into a work with an almost-carefree naturalness and mastery of language, so that the reader barely knows he is reading at all. F. Scott Fitzgerald begins his great American novel The Great Gatsby with the narrator, Nick Carraway, repeating his father’s counsel: “In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since.” From the very start, Fitzgerald handles the sail that he has raised to the wind and “beats against the current” (141) to the last page with constant control, where the reader is brought gently to the story’s conclusion. In seeking order, I want to maintain direction in my writing, to prevent those who follow my words from becoming lost in the vast spaces between my paragraphs or wandering off into the margins. If my thoughts are not clear to the reader, then I run the risk of them running astray or drowning in the undertow.\r\n\r\nMy first writing instructor once shouted a chorus of five words to me and my classmates that echo through my head whenever I read back what I’ve written in times of distress and struggle: “It is just a thing!” Well-intentioned, my instructor wanted us to remember that, in the end, what we put to paper was only ink. From that perspective, a paper should be no different than any other object I might wash or scrub in my kitchen—an item that is ultimately used and then returned to a shelf. But the problem is that the more a writer spends time with the “thing,” the more it becomes part of the writer’s existence and the more it begins to accumulate value.\r\nYou begin to care about the inanimate piece of paper because on it is a piece of your spirit. When you reach this point, you become frightened of getting involved any further. Once there is emotion attached to your work, it becomes possible to start thinking that the work itself requires your nurturing, and that stress of expectancy can cause you to flee. Although this idea is irrational, only a change of scenery can alleviate the anxiety. In circumstances such as these, it is best to be anywhere else—anywhere but here, in front of the computer monitor, typing on a keyboard. Although the disruption created in escaping can throw into disorder everything you’ve worked so hard to tidy up, leaving a mess behind, abandoning feels better than carrying the burden of caring on your shoulders.\r\n\r\nWhat is perplexing, however, is that the same means of escape is also an action that only prolongs the initial sequestering. Walker Percy states that the writer “is marooned in his cortex ... unlike the artist who can fool and cajole his right brain and get it going by messing in paints and clay and stone, the natural playground of the dreaming child self, there sits the poor writer, rigid as a stick, pencil poised, with no choice but to wait in fear and trembling until the spark jumps to the commissure” (147-148). Many times have I been seemingly locked in one place, as if cast away in isolation on an island somewhere inward, in an immaterial place in my brain. Being in such a place can block the connection that forms among the ink, the paper, and the creator.\r\n\r\nI can wander the streets for as long as I want, sample every cuisine in my neighborhood, and buy supplies for pets that I might not even own, but after a while I begin to get homesick. Detachment, in the end, reminds the writer inside that only through working with the words, playing with the emotions, and juggling the elements of form, does true clarity begin to take shape. For although an artist has the advantage of possessing the physical ingredients of creation, a writer has the flexibility of considering things that do not fall under the strict guidelines of the corporeal. Writers find in one idea—in a moment’s single spark—the possibility of extending oneself beyond one’s limits.\r\n\r\nBefore I finished this essay, I returned home and picked up the pieces that I had left scattered on the floor. It was getting dark, and outside flakes were falling beyond the fogged glass of my bedroom windows, dusting the world with a clean sheath of white.

But the problem is that the more a writer spends time with the “thing,” the more it becomes part of the writer’s existence and the more it begins to accumulate value.\r\nYou begin to care about the inanimate piece of paper because on it is a piece of your spirit. When you reach this point, you become frightened of getting involved any further. Once there is emotion attached to your work, it becomes possible to start thinking that the work itself requires your nurturing, and that stress of expectancy can cause you to flee. Although this idea is irrational, only a change of scenery can alleviate the anxiety. In circumstances such as these, it is best to be anywhere else—anywhere but here, in front of the computer monitor, typing on a keyboard. Although the disruption created in escaping can throw into disorder everything you’ve worked so hard to tidy up, leaving a mess behind, abandoning feels better than carrying the burden of caring on your shoulders.\r\n\r\nWhat is perplexing, however, is that the same means of escape is also an action that only prolongs the initial sequestering. Walker Percy states that the writer “is marooned in his cortex ... unlike the artist who can fool and cajole his right brain and get it going by messing in paints and clay and stone, the natural playground of the dreaming child self, there sits the poor writer, rigid as a stick, pencil poised, with no choice but to wait in fear and trembling until the spark jumps to the commissure” (147-148). Many times have I been seemingly locked in one place, as if cast away in isolation on an island somewhere inward, in an immaterial place in my brain. Being in such a place can block the connection that forms among the ink, the paper, and the creator.\r\n\r\nI can wander the streets for as long as I want, sample every cuisine in my neighborhood, and buy supplies for pets that I might not even own, but after a while I begin to get homesick. Detachment, in the end, reminds the writer inside that only through working with the words, playing with the emotions, and juggling the elements of form, does true clarity begin to take shape. For although an artist has the advantage of possessing the physical ingredients of creation, a writer has the flexibility of considering things that do not fall under the strict guidelines of the corporeal. Writers find in one idea—in a moment’s single spark—the possibility of extending oneself beyond one’s limits.\r\n\r\nBefore I finished this essay, I returned home and picked up the pieces that I had left scattered on the floor. It was getting dark, and outside flakes were falling beyond the fogged glass of my bedroom windows, dusting the world with a clean sheath of white. But even with a fresh start, I was still left with finding that damned first sentence. ', 'Housekeeping', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '255-autosave', '', '', '2012-02-27 07:37:44', '2012-02-27 07:37:44', '', 255, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?p=409', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

(257, 5, '2011-12-19 07:36:15', '2011-12-19 07:36:15', 'It was August of 2003, seven years since my family first emigrated from Ankara, Turkey to the U.S. and four years since, during one of our annual summer visits back, my father was murdered violently in an attack on the apartment we used to call home. It was my first time back to Turkey since the summer of the attack. I was sixteen years old, and as my mother, brother and I entered the apartment I was overcome with emotions at the scene before me. The walls were black with dust, the furniture was upturned and torn up where bullets had been excised, and the remaining police tape stood as a testament to the time-capsule the apartment had become, sealed off from the rest of the world since the days of the investigation and trial. But it was more than grief I felt as my family stood on the brink of this eerily preserved space. I felt guilt, because I knew that a part of me had wanted desperately to come back to Ankara, even to this very spot, since my father’s death. I also felt confusion, because in that moment—finally confronted with the terrifying scene before me—I wanted to know why it was that I had been pining to return.\r\n\r\nA similarly painful homecoming is examined by Marianne Hirsch and Leo Spitzer in their essay “‘We Would Not Have Come Without You’: Generations of Nostalgia.” The essay describes a 1998 trip Hirsch and Spitzer took accompanied by Lotte and Carl Hirsch, Marianne’s parents, to Lotte and Carl’s hometown of Czernowitz, now Chernivtsi, Ukraine. Although Czernowitz, of the Austro-Hungarian Habsburg Empire, was once their beloved home, it was also the place where Carl and Lotte “had suffered anti-Semitic persecution, Soviet occupation, internment in a Nazi ghetto… and… survived the Holocaust” (256). By blending accounts of Carl and Lotte’s first return trip—decades later—with their accompanying narratives about the past, Hirsch and Spitzer seek to answer the question: “why go at all to this place that for Carl and Lotte had been, in Eva Hoffman’s words, ‘home in a way, but…also hostile territory?’” (257).\r\n\r\nThe answer, according to the authors, lies in what Carl and Lotte’s narratives reveal about “the persistent and shifting shapes of nostalgia in the face of trauma,” and specifically in the concept of “ambivalent nostalgia” unique to survivors of tragedy (257, my italics). The authors define the concept of ambivalent nostalgia as Carl and Lotte’s ability to maintain “positive recollections of childhood and youth” alongside the negative memories of “traumatic events” that took place Czernowitz and ultimately “precipitated their departure” (260). This concept strikes me as exactly an articulation of the conflicting feelings I grappled with myself during the four years between my father’s death and our return to Turkey. On the one hand, I sorely missed Turkey because I had so much love for it as the country where I was born, the country where I was raised, the country where my grandparents, cousins, aunts, friends—all that mattered to me in the world—still lived on. On the other hand, I had lots of anger and hatred for it, as the country where we had to leave my father behind, an evil place seared with memories of a horrendous night that changed my life forever.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is understandable why the ambivalent coexistence of my feelings ultimately resulted in the creation of a third, more painful one: guilt for harboring fond memories of a place where something as horrible as my father’s murder could occur. According to Hirsch and Spitzer however, the very thing that characterizes ambivalent nostalgia is “traumatic dissociation—the process by which painful portions of experience survive and remain vividly present without being integrated or mastered by the subject” through “a psychic mechanism of splitting” (260). This definition of ambivalent nostalgia not only helps elucidate the confusing amalgamation of feelings I had; the dichotomy that it implies exonerates me from the guilt I felt for longing to return to Turkey. I can see how the splitting of memory in the face of tragedy results in two memories that coexist, leading to two different types of nostalgia, and, ultimately, to two distinct motivations for wanting to go back—one more, in fact, than that of the ordinary émigré.\r\n\r\nTo explain this phenomenon, it is important to first acknowledge the type of nostalgia that everyone experiences—the type that is independent of tragedy and independent even of temporal or geographic distance from a place: regular nostalgia. Hirsch and Spitzer identify it as “affectionate longings for earlier stages and scenes…as well as for pleasurable experiences in familiar places and settings” (259). Such nostalgia is universal and provides its own impetus for return to one’s homeland; it even exists independently, through the mechanism of splitting, for survivors of tragedy. “The disappointment that Carl and Lotte expressed during [their] first walk in the city after [their] arrival” is offered by Hirsch and Spitzer as evidence that they, too were “to some degree affected by” the simple desire to “reconnect an idea of the city that they had continued to keep alive in their minds to the sites they had once held dear: to view and touch them again in a material sense” (259).\r\n\r\nThis ordinary sense of homesickness also accounts for my own longing to return to the site of my father’s death. I was born and raised in that apartment, on a dusty, sunny, surprisingly quiet side street in the neighborhood of Kavaklidere in Ankara. One avenue removed from the bustling ana cade, or main street of the neighborhood, the apartment was a cherished wedding gift from my grandfather to my parents, two young but poor graduate students who couldn’t otherwise have afforded to live in that neighborhood. The city spilled into our apartment through its open, sun-warmed windows, in the form of the wafting scents of neighborhood cooking, or as the sounds of prayer floating in five times a day from the mosque on the other side of town. In turn, as I grew up, I first ventured outward into the city through those same windows. At the age of five, for example, I finally earned the much-anticipated responsibility of calling out from them to the simitci, the man who carries Turkish crescent breads on his head, to place orders for our Sunday brunches. It was through these windows that I staged my first elaborate imaginary games with my cousins, shouting orders down to them in the rose garden below during pirate sieges and ambushing them from above with snowballs during epic Eskimo battles. It was in the kitchen, living, and dining rooms of that apartment that my family congregated for nearly every other meal—cousins, aunts, uncles, and grandparents, dining together in the traditional Turkish manner, gathered around one huge merry table.\r\n\r\nThe loneliness my brother, mother and I felt in the States in those years following my father’s death as a result of having left our family members behind only exacerbated the regular nostalgia we felt. It cemented for me what Hirsch and Spitzer refer to as the “contrast between ‘there’ and ‘here,’ ‘then’ and ‘now,’ in which the absent is valued as somehow better, simpler, less fragmented” (258). The fond memories of my childhood and my family provided the first impetus for my longing to return. As Hirsch and Spitzer point out, “Returning the ‘homesick,’ the ‘nostalgic’ to their origins,” was believed by the Greeks to be “the cure for the disease” of nostalgia, its “restorative ending” (258).\r\n\r\nAt the same time, like Carl and Lotte—for whom “the positively tinged nostalgia for the past was only one aspect of their recollections,” I also carried “very negative and bitter memories” with me (259). Hirsch and Spitzer describe Carl and Lotte’s “determination to find, revisit, and show [them] the different apartments and houses where they had found refuge during their confinement in Czernowitz’s Jewish ghetto in October of 1941,” commenting that “negative and traumatic memories such as these were certainly the complicating other side of nostalgia” (260). Similarly, my fond memories of the apartment in Kavaklidere remain, to this day, overlaid by memories of the horrific: of violent struggle, the ring of gunshots, the crash of breaking windows. The same windows that facilitated my first memories of the city of Ankara now also exist in my negative memory as the route used by assailants to break into my home, and ultimately as the escape route that allowed the man who killed my father to evade prosecution for months following the attack.\r\n\r\nWhat’s remarkable is that the “psychic mechanism of splitting” described by Hirsch and Spitzer allows both positive and negative memories, even of the same exact place or thing, to coexist. What follows from this first “splitting” is the formation of a distinct second impetus, unique to the survivor, for wanting to return to the site of the trauma. The “ambivalent desire to recall negative experiences at the places where they happened” is “a significant motivation for return journeys such as the one we took to Czernowitz,” Hirsch and Spitzer write, and since, “in the act of recollection, traumatic events are inevitably linked to their points of origin” a physical return can “facilitate the process of working through” them (260). In retrospect, it is clear to me that the need for closure, the need to finally come to terms with the trauma we experienced, was my family’s own second impetus. It was the reason why my mother, my brother, and I found ourselves finally returning to that apartment after years of avoiding it—years during which I often questioned the validity of my coexisting fond memories.\r\n\r\nThis leads me to recognize a key distinction between the Hirsch and Spitzer essay and my own experience. For Carl and Lotte, returning to Czernowitz was certain to be somewhat disappointing; the city was bound to be different, not just because of the substantial temporal separation between memory and reality (1945-1998) but also because of the major ideological and political shifts that occurred in Czernowitz—many of them set in motion while Carl and Lotte lived there themselves. From the beginning, the changes taking place in their city caused them to develop memories “less and less connected to [Czernowitz’s] geographical location and ever more dependent on the vicissitudes of personal, familial, and cultural memory” (256). Thus in returning decades later, they already knew that there existed for them “inevitable disappointments and ironic incongruities in all attempts at homecoming.” (261).\r\n\r\nYet the Hirsch’s journey was still about connecting with the past. It was an attempt to “hold both sides of the past simultaneously in view without necessarily reconciling them, or ‘healing’ the rift” (261). They sought to uphold two realities at once, to be able to give credit to both, by overcoming any denial of trauma or “puncturing layers of erasure and oblivion” to “find vestiges of a vanished past” (274).\r\n\r\nMy own journeys back, in contrast, are about reconciling the real Ankara of my childhood with the terrifying, warped Ankara that exists as a separate place only in the land of my traumatic memory. In the eight years since my father’s death, Turkey certainly has undergone plenty of changes due to factors such as globalization; however, for the most part it remains the same. Unlike Carl and Lotte, when I return I have no trouble locating all the places I miss, and my family members, friends, and old neighbors are there to remind me that the past is not far behind. Everything remains the same, but my father is gone. The apartment remains like a time-capsule to this day—the one stark physical reminder that the events of that night are real. I might not otherwise believe it all actually happened the way it did; and frankly, in a way it would be easier to deny the whole thing. That first time my family went back, when we opened the musty apartment for the first time, I truly understood the emotional and psychological risk inherent in our journey. Hirsh and Spitzer mention this risk at the end of their essay: returning to the location of the trauma will always “authenticate” it, “to the point where it threatens to re-engulf those who come to tell and to listen” to the narratives of the past (272).\r\n\r\nCarl and Lotte are saved from such an experience, tethered to reality by the presence of Marianne—the child who would not have existed had they not survived the Holocaust. The “traffic noises and people around [them]” as they remember the past also “propel[s] [them] back into the present” (272). Similarly, each successive return to Turkey gets a bit easier for my family as the real Ankara seeps into the apartment: supportive neighbors venture inside with us, bake pastries, brew Turkish tea, and help us sort through our old clothes and photos. We are now well on our way to shutting the apartment down and moving on for good, though not without inevitable regret and sentimentality. Nowadays, I no longer feel guilty about that aspect of it: I have come to think of my “splitting” as more of a defense mechanism, allowing me to partition negative memory aside so that positive memory can live on. If it weren’t for this mechanism, after all, every evil event in the world would envelop the positive nostalgia, would snuff it out for good, and that would be the true tragedy.', 'Divide and Conquer: Shielding Good Memories from Evil', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'divide-and-conquer-shielding-good-memories-from-evil', '', '', '2012-02-27 04:19:50', '2012-02-27 04:19:50', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=257', 0, 'essay', '', 0),

(259, 5, '2011-12-19 07:37:28', '2011-12-19 07:37:28', '“You betrayed millions of readers.” With these words, Oprah confronted the author who had aroused a storm of controversy in the literary world. His name was James Frey, and, in four short months, his new best-selling memoir, A Million Little Pieces, had come under extreme scrutiny. The problem was that James Frey’s memoir was not a memoir at all—he had dramatized large sections of his life, in one instance expanding his hours in jail to three months. Frey fueled an already fiery debate over artistic license and dramatic rendering in the “non-fiction” genres of memoir and autobiography. How rigidly can and should authors adhere to the facts when recounting their life stories? By examining The Diary of Anne Frank as an emblematic work of the genre, it becomes clear that the faithful recounting of one’s own life is extremely difficult, if not impossible.\r\n\r\nThe world of self-narratives is often chaotic and blurry. Author Tom Sykes ironically announced in the Guardian that “fake memoirs are all the rage,” and publishers have created genre after genre of “autobiographical novel,” “semi-autobiographical novel,” “roman à clef,” and “nonfiction novel.” The ambiguity lies in autobiography’s presentational aim. Autobiography involves not only the portrayal of one’s life, but also “the construction of a public self” (Goffman 26). Erving Goffman asserts in The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life that each person takes on a role that they present to the world. In the process of self-representation, a conflict of interest arises: an author is tempted “to lie and to exaggerate,” to construct his or her own character. Although autobiography implies a “true” representation of the author’s life, language “always contains the possibility of lying” (Spicer 386). In the attempt to fashion a life into an interesting, readable book, autobiography takes on an “uneasy relation to fiction,” and this makes its factuality highly questionable.\r\n\r\nIf the autobiography is stripped of its self-consciousness—the motivation to dramatize, shape, and inflate—a unique genre, objective and factual, presumably emerges. The diary seems to stand alone in its claim to pure introspection. Philippe Lejeune, a French specialist of autobiography, lists the four functions of a diary: self-expression, reflection, the suspension of time, and the potential for pleasure from the writing process (Lejeune 106). The author pens a diary not for another’s entertainment or guidance, but for him- or herself. There is an element of secrecy that autobiographies lack in their exhibitionism—many people have memories of hiding childhood journals from parents. Where the autobiography thrives in its outward direction, in its desire to communicate with a world of readers, the diary begins as an inward turn; the writer is “alone, unable to pour it out to a friendly ear” (Lejune 106). Without the social obligation to present a coherent face and personality, a diarist can theoretically be honest with their dullness, their shortcomings, and their contradictions. The vacuum of pretensions should expose the true human being, stripped down and humbled.\r\n\r\nIn practice however, capturing an authentic experience proves much more difficult. Anne Frank’s diary points to the fluid relationship between the diary and the autobiography. The intertwining of the two genres begins with an author’s shifting intentions. When Frank first receives a blank, plaid journal at the age of thirteen, she intends it for her personal support and perusal. She writes, “I hope I shall be able to confide in you completely, as I have never been able to do in anyone before, and I hope that you will be a great support and comfort to me” (Frank 177). The word, “confide,” confers a secretive dimension to her writing. When she mentions that others, curious for a peek, have asked to read her diary, she describes their requests as breaches of her privacy. Frank seeks to relay her deeper feelings and thoughts through the most unassuming of mediums.\r\n\r\nFrank first mentions the idea of publishing her work when she hears a radio reporter suggest “a collection of diaries and letters after the war” (Frank 578). However, she moves on from this idea, or perhaps misinterprets it, to instead muse upon “Een roman van het Achterhuis,” or “a romance of the ‘Secret Annexe.’” The Dutch word, “roman,” more accurately translates into “novel” in English (Caplan 81), and it is here that the reader first glimpses Frank’s changing intentions. She sees that her diary will help with her “greatest wish . . . to become a journalist someday and later on a famous writer” (Frank 647). After constructing these plans, Frank’s diary takes on a new dimension: it no longer serves a merely personal function, but now provides the catalyst for Frank’s dream of becoming a celebrated author. She sees her diary as the foundation for a novel, a genre of fiction, and this vision, above all else, cements her decision to revise her entries.\r\n\r\nFrank proclaims, “I want to go on living after my death!” (Frank 647). And so she begins editing her earlier entries, adding, deleting, and rewording. Her revisions mimic the process of producing autobiography by reflecting upon the past. Autobiography looks back, “so if something escapes you, it’s the origin, not the ending” (Lejeune 103). In the act of revision, one inserts insights only later received and reconciles inconsistencies. In contrast, diarists are rooted in the present: there is no lapse in time between experiencing and reflecting on paper, and the diarist’s stories—his or her life—obviously lack an “ending.” The future “slips away . . . by showing up once again in the beyond.” (Lejeune 103). Although Frank’s original entries indeed unfold over the course of her time in the Annex and “she writes without knowing for certain the end of her story” (Caplan 81), she foresees an eventual ending. On May 20, 1944, she enthuses, “I have started my ‘Achterhuis.’ It is as good as finished” (Frank 653). The diarist always drives on, as the writing has no plot or form but the “shape of death” (Lejeune 103), Frank’s work possesses a direction. Her Het Achterhuis cannot live past her time at the Annex. In creating a conclusion for her diary, she enables herself to reflect, reexamine, and reshape her own story.\r\n\r\nFrom May to July of 1944, Frank edited her two previous years of entries. The Critical Edition separates Frank’s work into separate drafts—the a-text includes her originals, the b-text contains her own revisions, and the c-text the published version. These versions “set the Diary in a no-man’s-land between fiction and memoir” (Caplan 81). What Frank seeks to accomplish in altering her diary is to enhance its drama and artistic value. She seeks “to make the Diary both more vivid (pleasurable) and more public (useful) (Caplan 82). She simultaneously recalls and creates reality by rewriting a more explicit experience of everyday life. She injects into paragraphs the interruptions of daily life, the casual exclamations, and spur-of-the-moment observations. In most cases, a small addition along the lines of “it is so peaceful at the moment” (Frank 185) suffices, but her edits involving her family’s arrest prove much more heavy-handed.\r\n\r\nHer original entry on the event spans two paragraphs and only briefly captures the shock. She summaries her feelings with a concise, single sentence: “Of course I started to cry terribly and there was an awful to-do in our house” (Frank 207). When she revisits this text two years later, however, she unabashedly sells the fear and the despair of the situation. She alters the narrative structure, foreshadowing the soldiers’ entry before the arrest. She ends it with a cryptic, “hurried interjection of the present tense” (Caplan 82): “There goes the doorbell, Hello’s here, I’ll stop.” The audience is later led to the horrifying discovery that this visitor is actually the policeman and feels like they are there to witness it all.\r\n\r\nThe revised entry detailing the actual arrest expands greatly beyond the original and spans five pages. This time, Frank recounts in vivid detail her heightened emotions, the hour-by-hour developments, and the arduous task of packing. She speaks in fearful language—“I picture concentration camps and lonely cells” (Frank 207)—and describes her surroundings with attentiveness: “The stripped beds, the breakfast things lying on the table, a pound of meat in the kitchen for the cat” (Frank 210). The palpable suspense and the colorful scenes that seemingly unfold in real-time dramatize the story for an audience. When, after the arrest, she writes in the b-text, “Years seem to have passed between Sunday and now,” one wonders if she saw the irony. Years did pass between that fateful Sunday and the penning of that sentence—two, to be exact.\r\n\r\nWith the decision to publicize a text, there suddenly appears the recognition of an audience. The process of composing a diary for presentation involves not only the enhancing of literary content, but also the censorship of sensitive entries. Frank never intends for her audience to glimpse the immaturity and idealism that comes with adolescence. She writes at fifteen, “When I look over my diary today, 1 ½ years on . . . I no longer understand how I could write so freely . . . I really blush with shame when I read the pages dealing with subjects that I’d much better have left to the imagination. I put it all down so bluntly!” (Frank 305). Her “shame” refers to her entries on puberty (Frank 567) along with her romance with Peter van Pels, and she relieves this shame by removing a considerable number of these diaries.\r\n\r\nHer original entries on Peter are long and detailed. She writes as a young teenage girl, infatuated and exuberant at her first taste of love. “Oh, Peter, just say something at last, don’t let me drift on between hope and dejection” (Frank 526), she gushes. Naturally, after her enchantment fades, she feels inclined to excise entire months of entries that reference her preoccupation with him. She recreates her own adolescence, turning a “private diary into a public document” (Caplan 79). Even as a young author, Frank understands how text and identity merge: the diary serves as her reader’s only source for judging her character.\r\n\r\nIn moving form the a-text to the b-text, Frank frequently censors herself to control her identity. However, one can only guess at her ultimate plan, as she was never able to finish her work. Publishers, however, continued where she left off, interpreting, editing, and repackaging the author to fit their perceptions and preferences. In particular, there is a “de-judaisation” of her work in moving from the b-text to the c-text, as Rachel Feldhay Brenner discusses in “Anne Frank’s Portrait as a Young Artist.” She champions Het Achterhuis as “an extraordinary piece of writing produced by an extraordinary writer under extraordinary circumstances” (Brenner 109). Frank herself testifies to the significance of her identity and acknowledges “awareness of the terrifying historical reality against which, as a Jew, she writes her life story” (Brenner 109). In her diary, Frank comments, “It would be quite funny 10 years after the war if we Jews were to tell how we lived and what we ate and talked about here” (Frank 578). “We Jews,” she proclaims. Her work centers around her individual life story, but this story is inextricably connected to her Judaism. She recognizes her narrative’s indebtedness to this particular identity.\r\n\r\nThe publisher’s presentation of the diary largely overlooks her identification as a Jewish author. Of all translations, the Dutch edition alone preserves Frank’s original title. The English paperback, in contrast, calls itself, Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl. The first distortion is that of genre—Frank never intended to publish a diary, and her thorough edits reflect her intentions. Translators and editors, in “calling it a ‘diary’ . . . have perpetuated Anne’s own fiction of a day-to-day journal” (Caplan 79). More significantly, however, the title places “the content in the realm of the ‘normal’” (Brenner 106) when much of the diary seeks to relay the horrors of a war. Similarly, the synopsis on the back cover of the first English paperback edition suppresses the extraordinary for the ordinary, summarizing that “her story is that of every teen-ager” and focusing mainly on her relationship with Peter (Brenner 110). Frank loses her Jewish identity, and the book becomes a coming-of-age romance. She transforms into a generic “symbol of universal victimization and . . . prevailing humanism” (Brenner 110) that fails to capture an essential piece of her story: she is Jewish and narrates a specifically Jewish experience. To deny this obscures “the difference between Anne and other teen-agers” (Bernstein 2).\r\n\r\nThe life story encounters obstacles to truth at every step of its formation. The diarist falls prey to bias from the start. Anne Frank’s diary fails as a diary, as considerations for self-presentation are found within the text itself. The diary in full a-text form doesn’t even exist—there are no multiple drafts of entries after the day she conceives of Het Achterhuis, implying that from then on she writes with full acknowledgment of an audience. How does one then confront the problem of inaccuracy in portraying the events of one’s life? One may follow the lead of publishers and dissect the autobiography into minute, arbitrary, and often indistinguishable genres. One may lambast Anne Frank for her extrapolations and proclaim her a fraud. However, to argue in this manner misses the point. At the end of Frank’s diary, one leaves not with the remembrance of the embellished details of the war, but with the sentiments she inspires that cannot be falsified. She remains alive today precisely because she is presented, albeit inaccurately so, as an ordinary girl coming of age in times radically different yet still somehow familiar.

(261, 5, '2011-12-19 07:39:04', '2011-12-19 07:39:04', 'When local villagers of Godamuri first encountered the wolf children of Minapore in 1920, they immediately suspected that the wild creatures were Manush-Bagha, Bengali for ghost-headed man-bodied beasts. Driven by curiosity and eager to dispel local superstitions, Reverend J. A. L. Singh led a band of men into the jungle where he found two “hideous-looking beings” (Singh &amp; Zingg 5) huddled with a band of wolf pups in an old ant mound. Singh took the wolf-raised children back to his orphanage and named the younger one Amala and the elder Kamala. Singh kept a diary and recorded detailed observations of their feral behavior, such as the girls’ four-legged prowling and mangled midnight imitations of the noises the wolves made. Amala died a year after her introduction to human society, but her older sister lived on. Singh continued to painstakingly document Kamala’s “tardy development from a wolf-like existence to that of a human being” (Singh &amp; Zingg 38).\r\n\r\nThough Singh was deeply concerned with the well-being of the wolf-children, his diary was essentially a scientific case study, and he took a rational, dispassionate approach. This perspective prevented him from having to truly acknowledge the subjects of his investigations as human beings. He was more interested in the connection between heredity and the influence of environment, and he studied the feral children’s ability to comprehend language and their capacity for human emotion. Singh noted that when the children smiled, it was merely to show internal satisfaction of basic needs such as hunger. He wrote that “unlike human pleasures and joys, theirs were confined in a very narrow circle, while those of mankind are extensive, circumscribed by time only . . . All this spoke of a peculiar joy among animals only.” By contrasting their emotions with those of humans, Singh constructed a barrier between the feral children and ordinary people. Singh often made gestures towards eliciting sympathy in the reader, but he then qualified it with impassive statements. A year after capturing the children, he observed:\r\n\r\nKamala shed tears—a drop from each eye was seen trickling down her cheeks—only at the time when Amala breathed her last on the early morning of Wednesday, the twenty-first of September, 1921. Beyond this, emotional faculties were dormant, and not appreciable.\r\n\r\nThus, the most tragic event in Kamala’s life became an occasion for the study of emotion. The death of Amala clearly had its impact on Kamala, who spent nearly three days facing a wall and refusing to eat. But because she could not outwardly express her emotions, Singh concluded (with a belittling “only”) that she could not truly feel as a human being.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, Singh’s main goal was to present an objective understanding of feral children; eliciting sympathy was only his secondary aim, yet he still suffered from what Elizabeth Costello would have characterized as a “tragically limited” perspective. In a fictional speech at Applegate College, Elizabeth Costello, the character created by J. M. Coeztee in a 2003 novel by that same name argues that “the question to ask should not be: “Do we have something in common […] with other animals?” (Coetzee 34). Instead, Costello, who is a famous writer, believes that the way to ensure universal understanding is to break all barriers that separate the superiority of humans from the supposed inferiority of animals. She calls for us to recognize the spark of life and “embodied soul” (Coetzee 33) shared by all living creatures.\r\n\r\nCostello argues that if, as an author, she can think her way into the existence of a fictional character then it is possible to imagine ourselves into the existence of any living being. By this logic, the perspective of a child raised by wolves should not be difficult to understand at all. According to Costello, nothing can be viewed as “a fundamentally alien form of life” as long as it shares with us “the substrate of life.” Of course, Costello herself is not a real person, but the reader of Coetzee’s novel is still able to appreciate and understand her point of view. In fact, the reader herself becomes a vehicle in proving Coetzee’s point: the creative imagination has the power to extend beyond rational thought.\r\n\r\nCostello not only argues for but embodies the sympathetic imagination that Singh’s rationalist perspective lacks. Singh was so fascinated by the extent to which feral children differed from either humans or wolves that he failed to appreciate them on their own terms. In attempting to compare feral children to ordinary human beings, Singh finds that the wild child’s capabilities inevitably fall short, and he concludes that they lack the ability to reason. The danger of this perspective is that it implies feral children are unlike man and are not “godlike” but “thinglike” (Coetzee 23). With this belief, we open ourselves up to the possibility of treating them like “things,” too. It is clear that lack of imaginative compassion has dire consequences.\r\n\r\nLike Coetzee’s Costello, Martha Nussbaum calls upon imaginative compassion as the basis of our perspective towards other beings, but at the same time recognizes its unreliability. While Costello has no problem imagining herself in the form of a bat or even a corpse, Nussbaum acknowledges that there are obstacles in understanding any living thing. Nussbaum recalls an educational program director in rural India, who, when asked how a foreigner would understand the suffering of another person in another country, indicated the scope of the problem. He replied, “I have the greatest difficulty understanding my own sister” (Nussbaum 26).\r\n\r\nAnother problem with compassion is that it has the potential of slipping into partisan loyalty. As an example, Nussbaum cites the first baseball game in Chicago played after September 11, incidentally against the Yankees. Due to an increased awareness of the situation of New Yorkers, and perhaps the volume of beer consumed, the spectators began to chant “U-S-A, U-S-A.” At first, the chant was uttered as a sign of national unity, but eventually it devolved into a display of anger against the umpire after he made a questionable call.\r\n\r\nAlthough severing all attachments may be one extreme way to guard against loyalty to one’s own tribe, team, family, city, or species, Nussbaum does not believe in the option of universal impartiality. The extermination of these connections, she asserts, would only result in “death within life” (Nussbaum 23). Nussbaum suggests that we retain our local attachments while engaging with other cultures and experiences. She calls this critical compassion: a sympathy heightened by imagination and sensitivity to the arts. Nussbaum believes in the role of “tragic art in promoting good citizenship” and in the artist’s ability “to awaken a larger sense of the humanity of suffering” (Nussbuam 25). Tragic art, such as Euripides, dramatizes the loss of local attachments but also places them in a context that crosses cultural and temporal boundaries. Through these works of art, we vicariously experience the pain of others and transcend the limits of our own understanding.\r\n\r\nOnce we have honed our capacity for critical compassion, we may approach feral children in a new way. Although Karen Russell’s short story, “St. Lucy’s Home for Girls Raised by Wolves,” isn’t exactly tragic art, it contains loss and sorrow on a scale significant enough that we sympathize with the protagonists. “St Lucy’s” is the story of human children of werewolf parents who have been sent to a sanctuary managed by nuns who aimed to “humanize” the young girls. In order to help the children transition into society, the authoritative nuns erase the girls’ original names (‘GWARR!’ and ‘HWRAA!’) and re-christen them Jeanette and Mirabella. The girls struggle to suppress their lupine ways and adopt the human code of falsities and formality. The story of the girls of “St. Lucy’s” bears many similarities to that of Amala and Kamala, but the key difference is that Karen Russell, unlike Reverend Singh, is able to engage our critical compassion. Russell describes how the girls lose their local attachments and societal connections. Even so, Russell is able to narrate from a distinctly wolfish point of view:\r\n\r\nThose were the days when we dreamed of rivers and meat. The full-moon nights were the worst! Worse than cold toilet seats and boiled tomatoes, worse than trying to will our tongues to curl around our false new names.\r\n\r\nRussell enters the mind of a wolf-girl so seamlessly that everything we regard as completely normal—even cooked vegetables and toilet seats—suddenly becomes alien. It is this disengagement from the human world that allows the reader to fully enter the realm of the wolf-girls. From the feral point of view, being human means knowing how to apologize, play golf, say “How do you do,” talk about the weather, and carry out other decorous social rituals. Humans are not civilized but “bred in captivity” (Russell 236), trapped by their own sense of civilized refinement.&lt;\r\n\r\nRussell’s wolf-children are the stuff of myths; nowadays children raised in the wild are extremely rare. But by stepping into the paws of the wolf-children, we gain an objective standpoint from which to recognize the contradictions and artificialities of our own human society. As Costello argues, sympathy is “all about the subject,” not the object. Costello’s act of imagining herself as a bat does nothing to affect the well-being of the bat. In reality, it is the act itself that has changed the subject and the subject’s ability to view the world around her.\r\n\r\nOur compassion then is for our own benefit: the simple act of empathizing is a lesson in self-awareness. We can consider using our critical compassion to imagine ourselves as various animals whose lives are directly or indirectly affected by our own. It is not enough for us to imagine ourselves as a bat; we need to examine how this perspective affects human lives, customs, and rituals that are taken for granted. Imagine yourself, then, as the rat in the subway running away with your discarded bagel, or the squirrel guarding the last Redwood, or the mosquito landing on your arm. If you briefly distance yourself from human attachments and gaze at the world though the eyes of another creature, you may notice something about yourself that you had never previously seen.

As Yet Untitled by the modern sculptor Anish Kapoor comprises thousands of hexagonal mirrors, each no more than an inch across, which compose a reticulate pattern and combine to form an enormous concave disc. Its mirrored surface reflects light from every direction, displaying countless miniature images. From a distance, the structure appears nebulous, a distorted and unsettling reflection of its surroundings. As the viewer approaches the disc, he sees a warped and unfocused reflection of himself; surrounding this reflection, there hover thousands of miniature viewers, each staring directly back.\r\n\r\nAs Yet Untitled generates an unnerving sense of being watched, similar to the sensation described by Michel Foucault in “Panopticism.” In this essay, the French philosopher describes how society imposes discipline in the modern age. Using Jeremy Bentham’s Panopticon as an architectural model, Foucault unravels the intricate control structures that permeate society. Systems of omnipresent surveillance make everything visible and compel people into a state of submissive productivity, clouding their individuality. Although Kapoor’s As Yet Untitled functions by exaggerating visibility, it ultimately blurs reality, reproducing the systems of control at work in Foucault’s panoptic society. A juxtaposition of the essay and the artwork exposes the potency of each: Foucault’s essay explains the overwhelming effect of Kapoor’s sculpture, while the sculpture provides a tangible manifestation of the theoretical power mechanism described in the essay.\r\n\r\nThe Panopticon is a spectacular specimen of discipline and power. Foucault describes the structure as “an annular building,” the perimeter of which “is divided into cells, each of which extends the whole width of the building” (200). Each cell has “two windows,” one facing inwards towards the center of the building and one facing outwards, so as to “allow the light to cross the cell from one end to the other” (200). At the center of the building is a tower, “pierced with wide windows that open in the inner side of the ring,” so that a supervisor can “observe from the tower, standing out precisely against the light, the small captive shadows in the cells of the periphery” (200). When a person stands at the focal point of As Yet Untitled, he becomes the supervisor and each individual mirror becomes a cell, imprisoning the miniature reflection of the viewer. Like the cells of the Panopticon, each mirror is “like so many cages, so many small theatres,” in which each image of the viewer is “perfectly alone, perfectly individualized and constantly visible” (200). Both structures require the constant presence of light. The Panopticon relies on backlighting to illuminate the inmate’s silhouette while As Yet Untitled relies on the reflection of light to produce the viewer’s image. In both cases, light effectively traps the inmate in a state of “permanent visibility” (201). Both mechanisms achieve their function not by force, but by an instrument of “architecture and geometry” (206). The power of each stems from the fact that a single supervisor can keep watch on all the inmates simultaneously\r\n\r\nKapoor designed As Yet Untitled so that it operates autonomously. As with the panoptic machine, it does not matter who exercises power. Foucault explains that “any individual, taken almost at random, can operate the [Panopticon]” (202). Similarly, any viewer “arriving unexpectedly at the center” of As Yet Untitled immediately finds himself in a position of power; he can keep watch on the many mirrors surrounding his field of view (204). Kapoor leaves the structure to hang alone in a museum, relinquishing control to anyone who steps in front of it. However, like the panopticon, the artwork sustains “a power relation independent of the person who exercises it” (201). No single individual governs the system, and this quality “assures the automatic functioning of power” (201). As Yet Untitled exists as a self-sufficient instrument of power, dependent only on the mechanical gaze of its viewers.\r\n\r\nThe sculpture fully integrates the role of supervisor and inmate. The viewer constantly watches his many reflections; the reflections, in turn, stare directly back, placing the viewer under perpetual observation. Foucault asserts that in the panoptic society, “an individual inscribes in himself the power relation in which he simultaneously plays both roles; he becomes the principle of his own subjection” (202-3). Like Foucault’s panoptic society, As Yet Untitled requires no centralized power because the viewer effectively keeps watch on himself. The concave shape of the structure makes the viewer the object of surveillance. Concave mirrors reflect light towards their focal point, precisely where the viewer is standing. In the Panopticon, which focuses all incoming light on the viewer, light serves as a tool for total visibility and perpetual observation. The sculpture necessarily integrates the viewer in the process of observation, for the viewer has no choice but to participate. As Foucault writes, “enclosed as he is in the middle of this architectural mechanism, is not the director’s own fate entirely bound up with it?” (204) Ultimately, however, As Yet Untitled combines the role of observer and observed in a way that the Panopticon cannot: the viewer and his reflection—the surveyor and the surveyed—are in fact one and the same.\r\n\r\nBecause Kapoor constructs As Yet Untitled from mirrors, he attaches important cultural meaning to the artwork, contributing to the work’s panoptic qualities. Mirrors function as tools for self-modification, for surveillance and for deception. They hang in conspicuous places—bathrooms, clothing stores, and dance studios—and constantly remind people of their appearance. Mirrors propagate self-awareness. Self-awareness fosters growth and development as people attempt to produce an image of themselves that satisfies their personal standards. Panopticism achieves a similar end, as its aim is “to strengthen the social forces—to increase production,” and “to increase the possible utility of individuals” (208, 210). As Yet Untitled contains thousands of mirrors and produces thousands of images of the viewer, generating an excessive sense of self-awareness. Mirrors also serve as an instrument of surveillance: two-way mirrors in interrogation rooms, convex mirrors in security cameras, and rear-view mirrors in vehicles all function to keep watch on others. Lastly, mirrors have the ability to distort reality and foster deception. Magicians use mirrors to create illusions; amusement parks use houses of mirrors to confuse patrons; and interior decorators use decorative mirrors to make rooms appear larger. The panoptic society is, at its core, a complex illusion that tricks citizens into monitoring one another—“factories, schools, barracks, [and] hospitals” are not the social organizations they appear to be, but rather sources of discipline and control (228). Similarly, As Yet Untitled’s densely mirrored surface distorts the world around it, thrusting the viewer into an elaborate panoptic illusion.\r\n\r\nThe image displayed in As Yet Untitled resembles the panoptic society as a whole. Standing at the structure’s focal point, the viewer sees his own distorted image in the center of the disc, surrounded by thousands of other miniature images. The central image of the viewer is blurred, his image diffused; he is no longer an individual, but the generic product of the panoptic machine. Each surrounding mirror contains a reproduction of the same person, and each person serves the same function; each is constantly watching, like a “faceless gaze that transform[s] the whole social body into a field of perception: thousands of eyes posted everywhere” (214). The result is a society of people without individuality, working to perpetuate what Foucault calls “omnipresent surveillance” (214). The image portrays a system “in which the exercise of power may be supervised by society as a whole,” by a homogeneous population of observers (207).\r\n\r\nTurning away from As Yet Untitled, the viewer experiences a peculiar sensation. His vision is unfocused, clarity dislodged, because his eyes, confused by the artwork’s visual tricks, interpret a reality broken up into thousands of tiny hexagons. He walks away with a warped visual perception of his surroundings. As Yet Untitled’s distorting effects follow the viewer even when he is no longer viewing the sculpture. Like the panoptic society, it clouds the perceptions of the individual. There is nothing inherently unclear about either panopticism or As Yet Untitled. Both mechanisms function by generating visibility, not by obscuring it. Both, however, have the ability to illuminate as well as to conceal, and ultimately create merely an illusion of reality. These structures effect a loss of clarity, a blurring of edges between the observer and the observed; the individual and the society; the viewer and his image.', 'Blurred Edges: ‘As Yet Untitled’ and the Panoptic Society', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'blurred-edges-as-yet-untitled-and-the-panoptic-society', '', '', '2012-04-10 16:01:19', '2012-04-10 16:01:19', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=263', 0, 'essay', '', 0),

Just do it. Before you die your life flashes before your eyes, so make it something worth looking at. Advertising executives, writers, musicians, and friends all have one thing to say: live your life. However, as human beings we think of old homes and future bachelor pads or of first school days and dream jobs because we have more than just the present; we have the past and the future. We have memories to fall back on and dreams to aspire to. We have then, now, and later, which we jump to and from in our everyday lives. We think, therefore we are. We live in order to have something to think about.\r\n\r\nAndré Aciman understands. In his essay, “Arbitrage,” Aciman introduces and explores the concept of “mnemonic arbitrage” (152), which ties into the idea of experiencing the moment to look back on it. Mnemonic arbitrage occurs when an individual “[firms] up the present by experiencing it as a memory, by experiencing it from the future as a moment in the past” (151). The individual “grounds the present on the past, and the future on the past recaptured” (152), such that riding a bike in Central Park is not ‘the moment.’ Instead, the moment is consecutively remembering the last time you rode the bike in Central Park and anticipating the fact that you will remember this current bike ride in Central Park. You are “not just remembering. [You are] remembering remembering” (152). Mnemonic arbitrage is a more complex idea than memory or nostalgia; it captures the human instinct to save memories for later.\r\n\r\nAciman verbalizes what for many of us may be a passing thought, a second, or a snap. His narrative style conveys this by jumping from setting to setting: an apartment in Cambridge, a street in Alexandria, a street in Rome, and a graveyard in a fictional story. He borrows from time and place, mixing and matching the two, simulating arbitrage, and entering “a realm where memory and imagination [trade] places with the dizzying agility of an entrechat” (162). To Aciman, arbitrage is a gift that can brighten up even the dullest of days: “if nothing were to happen in my life to make me happy, the very act of thinking back on things could make me no less happy than an experienced Ulysses waking up in Ithaca still thinking of the journey home” (164). Here, Ulysses looks back through rose-tinted glasses and finds joy in his homecoming by thinking about the journey home when he dreamed of a future homecoming.\r\n\r\nNaturally, “Arbitrage” made me look back on my own memories in search of that dizzying realm. Aciman’s images of sweet nostalgia suggested that I was missing a piece of the puzzle as I tried and failed to think of moments in my past that still resounded within me. The words haunted me: <em>Live your life. Just do it. Carpe Diem, “The very act of thinking back on things could make me no less happy….”</em>Yet I was drawing a blank. My mind was not buzzing with eighteen years of color.\r\n\r\nWhen Aciman writes, “[I]t was not even this moment, or this place, or this girl that mattered anymore but how I’d woven my desire to live and be happy with each,” I imagine the intense feeling of mnemonic arbitrage to be like a film reel speeding past, flashing colors at me as I zoom in on specific stories and jump to another and another, remembering not the past experience but the feeling it gives me now, laughing at the time when I got lost on the subway though the experience itself was frustrating (164). However, when I look back I see my childhood up to the age of eight. I see colors upon colors, memories upon memories—and then I see blank. There are only gray moments popping up here and there on the film reel that is my eighteen years. I find myself trying to force good memories out of things I can’t seem to remember.\r\n\r\nThe confusion gives birth to questions that come in tens and suddenly I begin to connect dots: I spent my formative years in Hong Kong. I grew up on the furthest point on the globe from Columbia, from New York City, from my favorite bands, from my favorite musicals, from my ideal life. To bridge the gargantuan gap between my obsessions and me, I turned to the one thing that could take me to London (to New York, to Brazil, to Mali) in a mouse click. The Internet helped me indulge in my obsessions. By simulating my ideal life, I could remove myself from the present into my own dizzying realm. But the Internet is only a simulation of reality: we live on our ‘<em>home</em>pages’ and check our ‘e-<em>mails</em>’, as we read a ‘web<em>page</em>’ and ‘i<em>Chat</em>’ with our friends. However, as a child of the digital age the Internet is not just a simulation of my life, it has become my life.\r\n\r\nI recently moved to New York to attend Columbia University and saw my then only living idol (Regina Spektor) in concert. As my dream panned out before me, I was thinking of the weblog entry I was going to write about it; I was substantiating the moment, preparing it for the long-term. As an arbitrageur, I was enjoying the concert by performing mnemonic arbitrage, by thinking of myself in the future remembering her performance and documenting it on the internet.\r\n\r\nMy relationship with the Internet is a vicious cycle. In anticipating my ideal future, I jumped to the Internet to keep my mind in what was coming. But now that I am living the life I anticipated, I have become an online arbitrageur, trying to solidify the present by documenting it for the future. However, this online arbitrage causes me to lose mental memories because I spend my time anticipating the physical documentation of moments rather than experiencing the moments themselves so that I can remember nostalgically.\r\n\r\nThe two subjects—mnemonic arbitrage and the Internet—are very similar. With the Internet, I remove arbitrage from my mind and put it online. I enjoy a party by taking pictures to put on the Internet and thereby remember it. But, unlike mnemonic arbitrage, online arbitrage takes much more than a split second, and so it becomes my life instead of a mere fragment of it. Aciman’s character (the young man) realizes that “unless he makes an effort to remember where [his grandfather’s tombstone] is, he’ll never be able to find the grave again” and just like the young man, I fear “losing that future memory” (154, 151). But I find myself in a more dire situation. In my life, consisting of the endless saving of these memories, I stop living the moments that become flashes of color on the film reel: my memory draws a blank.\r\n\r\nBoth online and mnemonic arbitrage can produce a sense of satisfaction and that is what makes them so addictive. However, in the long run, being an arbitrageur can cause a person to forget about life itself. Aciman explores this irony in the quote “I was, in Alexandria, homesick for a place from which I had learned to re-create Alexandria” (157). It is as if the individual is worshipping the image with the real thing at his fingertips. With mnemonic arbitrage a person does not live in the present, but rather anticipates the future documentation of it. In trying to never forget the world, a person ceases to appreciate its presence. The result is irony; reality is not enough, although the process of arbitrage begins as an attempt to solidify it. As an online arbitrageur, I am at a party homesick for the weblog where I will recount the party. I have stopped creating moments; instead I am saving them for the rainy day. But as I put my memories online, I burn the memories onto disc, erase them from my mind, and create a blank mental film reel.\r\n\r\nThis blank film reel is the result of making a natural thing unnatural, changing arbitrage from an act of memory into the physical act of recording it online. After all, if the smell of fresh soil is meant to take me back to the day I got stuck in a field, how can I remember that moment if, instead of taking in the smells and sights, I was planning a blog entry? The blank film reel is a result of the second-person experiences created by physical online arbitrage. With mnemonic arbitrage, I still have the memory of the present even though I am thinking of the future and past. Alternatively, with online arbitrage, I lose the present. Aciman writes that, in Egypt, “you are forced to squint or avoid looking directly at anything” and this is also the case with online arbitrage (159). Perhaps I have substituted online arbitrage for its mnemonic counterpart because there is something appealing about having my memories available online for everyone to see: like when suburbanites bombard houseguests with family albums because a memory seems more valid when other people can physically see it—it remains unchanged by time and is always remembered as it was.\r\n\r\nMnemonic arbitrage can help a person look at the world in a much deeper way because, through the intricate exchanges of place and time, the world becomes our own. The sight of marbles can take us back ten years to the school playground. But reading a weblog from May 24, 2004 is a completely different experience. Instead of the scent of a burning match taking me back to the time my sisters and I held a séance, I have a write-up of the séance complete with pictures, while the experience of the séance itself consisted of the mental preparation of the weblog. Mnemonic arbitrage allows you the chance to ‘live your life,’ but online arbitrage removes that chance and replaces it with a blank film reel.\r\n\r\nThe words will continue to ring around us, telling us to ‘just do it,’ ‘live for the moment,’ or ‘seize the day.’ That is exactly what we need to do. Life is a combination of arbitrage and experience. Like Aciman’s “writing [his story] and returning [to Egypt],” they are bound in very intricate ways (159). They cannot be pulled apart because arbitrage is human nature; we will inherently think about the past and future but still have the present. It is easy to fixate on memories and the future when we are unhappy with the present, but as we ponder what ifs and maybes or lust for yesteryears, we are losing moments that could become memories, just as I lost the memories of ages eight to eighteen through online arbitrage. However, the solution is not to banish the Internet from our lives—it is not a tumor that needs to be removed, but a social innovation as fundamentally altering as the discovery of fire, and like fire it contains unpredictable advantages and dangers. I may draw a mental blank because of internet arbitrage, but I haven’t lost the memory of my teenage years – they are online and that is a consolation. Still, reading “Arbitrage” has made me conscious of my problem, has taught me that I need to enjoy the future that I’ve always wanted while it’s happening. Life is never set in the Garden of Eden, and it would be nice to have access to “a realm where memory and imagination [trade] places with the dizzying agility of an entrechat” without having to log online (162).

Just do it. Before you die your life flashes before your eyes, so make it something worth looking at. Advertising executives, writers, musicians, and friends all have one thing to say: live your life. However, as human beings we think of old homes and future bachelor pads or of first school days and dream jobs because we have more than just the present; we have the past and the future. We have memories to fall back on and dreams to aspire to. We have then, now, and later, which we jump to and from in our everyday lives. We think, therefore we are. We live in order to have something to think about.\n\nAndré Aciman understands. In his essay, “Arbitrage,” Aciman introduces and explores the concept of “mnemonic arbitrage” (152), which ties into the idea of experiencing the moment to look back on it. Mnemonic arbitrage occurs when an individual “[firms] up the present by experiencing it as a memory, by experiencing it from the future as a moment in the past” (151). The individual “grounds the present on the past, and the future on the past recaptured” (152), such that riding a bike in Central Park is not ‘the moment.’ Instead, the moment is consecutively remembering the last time you rode the bike in Central Park and anticipating the fact that you will remember this current bike ride in Central Park.

I was back in Harvard Square, where I had lived the preceding summer while interning at the Democratic National Convention. I was pleased to return, but I knew it was to a different place. Out of Town News, Harvard Yard, the Quad, Felipe’s Taqueria: none of them were the same—the landscape had changed. The musicians had left the streets to find a lonely coffeehouse mic. The LaRouche proselytizers had left to hibernate for another four years. The t-shirts and sandals of summer sun had retreated in the face of winter’s austere countenance. My political innocence was gone, as well. Two weeks ago, the election had fallen upon me with all the heavy weight of reality. Challenged by the outcome, I was a changed person looking at a changed landscape: over everything, an inch of fresh snow.\r\n\r\nI walked slowly to my friend’s dorm where I would be spending the weekend. Quiet lingered in the air. I could hear the soft crunch of New Balance on slush. It was as if the election had hastened the arrival of winter, as if the capitol of liberal politics was eager to retreat to the safety of the fireside. There, in oak-paneled studies with bookcases, thinking citizens would insulate themselves from the anti-intellectual New America, thumbing endlessly through back copies of the <em>New Yorker</em>, mourning past evocations of hope and possibility. I peered through the humble Puritan windowpanes along Dunster Street, convinced that those citizens were in each room. I watched my breath disappear in the falling snow, wondering where American borders really lie.\r\n\r\nByron E. Shafer opens his book <em>Bifurcated Politics</em> by admitting, “Even in an era when it is widely viewed as an institution in decline, the national party convention retains a certain immediate, raw, and visceral fascination” (1). I can sympathize. As a young politico working the convention, being in such a high-level political environment was exciting. I spoke to Jesse Jackson and James Carville on the phone. Terry McAuliffe (T-Mac to those in the know) was constantly in my midst. I shook hands with Barack Obama and Larry David, and I took a picture with George McGovern. Teresa Heinz Kerry signed my poster. I patiently awaited my CNN interview with cellphone in hand and credentials around my neck.\r\n\r\nWhat I was less apt to recognize was the “institution in decline” part of the experience. We the convention committee (in order to form a more perfect union), perched atop a skyscraper looking down on the Old State House, would hear about Mayor Menino’s problems with the police union. We would hear that Boston was going to lose—rather than gain, as was originally believed—significant sums of money on the convention. We would hear the complaints of Bostonians: too much traffic, altered public transportation, increased terrorist threat. We would hear, but we weren’t really listening. After all, they, the complainers, were on the outside. They couldn’t understand that it was all necessary. What did they know?\r\n\r\nIn her essay “Insider Baseball,” Joan Didion speaks to my experience. Writing about the Dukakis campaign of 1988, she considers the “assumption” of people within politics that “the narrative should be not just written only by its own specialists but also legible only to its own specialists” (50). Part of me thought that since I had an ID card that said DNC 2004 on it, I was more qualified to assess the convention. Those on the other side of the glass didn’t really know what they were talking about.\r\n\r\nDidion also details a scene in which Dukakis plays catch with one of his campaign aides on an airport tarmac. Didion writes:\r\n<blockquote>What we had in the tarmac arrival with ball tossing, then, was an understanding: a repeated moment witnessed by many people, all of whom believed it to be a setup and yet most of whom believed that only an outsider, only someone too ‘naïve’ to know the rules of the game, would so describe it. (65)</blockquote>\r\nDamned if I would be naïve. A friend of mine who had worked on the Dean campaign in New Hampshire (and was now in Vietnam on a fellowship) complained about the unnecessary level of control and choreography that he saw going into the convention. I told him it was all necessary: the lighting cues, the careful choice of music, the placement of the delegations on the floor, the speakers’ obligation to submit speeches beforehand for approval. “We can’t risk a disorganized appearance,” I insisted, “there is too much at stake.” What we needed, I believed (not uniquely, I might add), was to project an image of unified professionalism that would dispel, among other things, notions of a party torn by an extraordinarily divisive primary season. John Kerry was our man, and he would deliver us from George W. Bush’s dark presidency. Any calls for a more natural political forum misunderstood political strategy. Those who made those calls were, by definition, “outsiders.”\r\n\r\nThe narrative of insiderism that the convention unwittingly created proved to be destructive to its appeal. A bubble—dreaded in theory, embraced in practice—surrounded all things DNC. I remember on Thursday night, the last night of the whole spectacle, my friend Eric, who was interning for CNN, was able to get me into a party at the Roxy. Maroon 5 played the event. In the middle of the set, John Edwards—sleeves rolled up, tie loosened, mic in hand—appeared onstage in front of a dramatic green light as a fog machine did its thing. He looked heroic, almost godlike. He engaged the crowd: “This may look like a concert, this may feel like a concert, and this may sound like a concert.” The crowd quieted. We waited for his words. “But this is a movement.” We erupted. We were, of course, ready to cheer.\r\n\r\nEven this memory—one I recall so fondly—has paled since the election. Whereas I originally experienced it in terms of Shafer’s raw, visceral fascination, now I can’t help but see the shadow of decay about it, evidence of a declining institution. There I stood with two different credentials (one for the Fleet, one for the Roxy) in the plastic sleeve on my “Democrats Win It in the Field” lanyard, supposedly affirming some sort of “movement.” Was this the field? Was this where we were supposed to win it? After leaving one closed event, I was now at another closed event, both of which had further levels of exclusivity within them. Even worse, we—supposedly the party of the First Amendment—feared protests so much that we restricted peaceful demonstrations to an aptly named “Free Speech Zone” festooned with nets to “protect the delegates.” On the closing night of the convention, I stared as hundreds of police donned storm trooper riot gear and clogged the surrounding streets.\r\n\r\nWe assumed the movement Edwards referred to must have been some sort of popular uprising against the Republicans. But surely velvet ropes and nightsticks do not comprise a popular movement. In Boston, Massachusetts, the seat of leftist American politics, America’s foremost liberal party managed to hold a convention detested by the city’s citizens. Having always believed the Democrats to be a populist alternative to the stodgy GOP, I associated them with popular appeal. After all, Jules Witcover calls his history of the Democrats Party of the People. But the character of their convention—our convention, as it were—denied any such claim. In the end, far from anything I could have imagined earlier, exclusion may have been the name of the game. It certainly was at all of the satellite events: the Media Party in south Boston, the Rock the Vote party at the Avalon, the delegate parties throughout the week, the closing party at the Roxy. A prevailing insiderism dominated what was supposed to be our chance to show the country we were not a party of distant intellectual elites. It reminds me of my high school history teacher’s favorite phrase: “Lost opportunity.”\r\n\r\nThe parties, the symposiums, the caucuses, the book signings, the balloons, the music, the traffic, the t-shirts: all this, and for what? Conventions simply boost a general election season by approving a candidate already chosen. In reality, the DNC is little more than an extravagantly expensive gas station on the campaign trail. How expensive? The <em>Boston Globe</em> set the estimated cost of the convention at $95 million (Klein). Is it really justifiable to put that much money into such a weak institution, an institution whose own biographer considers it to be declining? If the convention were to serve a more pivotal purpose, such funding might be excusable; but to throw so much money at ratifying a foregone conclusion seems downright irresponsible.\r\n\r\nThe convention as an institution has not always been so weak. It was not always like today’s incarnation, essentially a well-dressed figurehead strutting around with a practiced air of self-importance. In fact, political conventions began in 1832 as a reaction against the same elite class that today’s conventions serve to propel. It was the nation’s first third party of note, the Anti-Masons, which introduced the concept of a national political convention. In <em>Party of the People</em>, Jules Witcover writes:\r\n<blockquote>(The Anti-Mason convention) was born of a case of the suspected murder of one William Morgan, of Batavia, New York, a former member of the secret Society of Freemasons who disappeared as he was about to publish an exposé of the society. Attempts to block its publication created demands for an investigation and ultimately a clamor against Masons in public office, culminating in a call for a convention to nominate a presidential candidate. (143)</blockquote>\r\nIronically, that convention nominated William Wirt, a rather uninteresting candidate who specifically stated his indifference to Masonry, to stand against Masons Andrew Jackson and Henry Clay (Witcover 143). However, much like today’s third parties, the Anti-Masons were less interested in a viable campaign than in national attention to their issues of import. As Shafer writes, “The quickest route to national stature was a presidential campaign, but the new party could hardly launch such a campaign with the dominant nominating device to that date, a caucus of party members in the U.S. Congress, because it possessed none” (9). From that point on, the national convention would replace the party caucus as the primary theater of presidential nomination. How strange it would be for the Anti-Masons to see the national convention, this child of theirs, existing today on the lifeblood of exclusivity and police security.\r\n\r\nIn terms of power, 1832 marked the beginning of a period that would last until 1952, at which point the convention began to look quite like the current ones. Within this period, the convention exhibited great power, deposing numerous sitting presidents, including John Tyler, Millard Fillmore, Franklin Pierce, and Chester Arthur. It also chose dark-horse candidates like James K. Polk (Shafer 15). Convention discourse centered mostly around the nominee in question, with some conventions featuring extended debate on whom to choose. But the decline of local political parties, as exemplified by New Deal legislation, had prepared the original convention character for its last hurrah in 1952. Shafer writes, “The Democratic convention of 1952 was the last of the classic old-style party gatherings and featured behavior which in its essence would have been familiar to convention participants a hundred years before” (33). He continues: “The product of this politicking, the candidate, had entered no primaries and engaged in no direct campaigning prior to his nomination” (33). Every convention thereafter demonstrated the shift of the nomination away from the convention itself and into the primary season, creating a movement towards today’s condition in which the convention serves only to approve a decision already made.\r\n\r\nThat shift accelerated in 1968 due to the tumultuous Democratic convention in Chicago, at which tens of thousands of protestors took their dissent to the streets. Their calls for bringing the political process nearer to the people ushered in an era of reform politics that saw the proliferation of the primary season, one perceived solution to the problem of high-level political bureaucracy. As a result, the convention evolved into the weakened form it holds to this day (Shafer 42). Stripped of its original nominating function, the convention began to look more like a risk than an opportunity. The two election cycles of the 1970’s demonstrated this idea. Shafer writes:\r\n<blockquote>In 1972, a Democratic convention featuring deep divisions between the nominee and his challengers and between the nominee and some of his own delegates was paired with a Republican convention featuring little evident conflict in either area. Yet only four years later, it was the Republican convention which manifested the major candidate conflict, along with exacerbating issue divisions, while the Democratic convention escaped candidate splits entirely and surfaced only minor issue conflicts to fuel its limited struggles. (150)</blockquote>\r\nIn both 1972 and 1976, the party that presented a more unified convention won the general election. This contrast between unity and disunity, unity triumphing each time, proved to be a lesson politicians would not soon forget. With the potential for a divisive primary season constantly threatening to produce an image of a party in conflict, conventions began to focus energy on polished appearance rather than honest debate. Disunity, an ominous sign of weakness, took on the characteristics of a risk to avoid at all costs.\r\n\r\nFor better or for worse, it seems the Democrats know their history. The 1970s conventions set a precedent—unity at all costs—that the national parties emulate to this day. One can imagine T-Mac and convention CEO Rod O’Connor sitting in a well-lit office late at night pondering the official convention slogan. America 2004: The Democratic Convention, or America 2004: A Stronger America? The differences are subtle, even aesthetic. But by July 26, the message had changed from the former to the latter. There could be nothing weak about this convention; history warns as much. “Strong” necessarily conjures images of unity, for strength is predicated on organized support. At the expense of a real political forum, we proceed with this historically fortified notion of strength, for we have learned the lessons of the ’70s. Certainly “unschooled” has never been an accusation leveled at Democrats. Nevertheless, the Golden Age of conventions is dead, and even the current age declines. Surely Swinburne waxed rhetorical when he asked, “Is not Precedent a king of men?”\r\n\r\nNow that the post-election pall had descended and winter had frozen over Harvard Square, I began to reevaluate my memories. After all, “we” had lost. This summer, good little Democrat that I was, I probably would have described the color of the convention as some sort of fluorescent blue. Now I might side with the dreaded gray. Neither red nor blue, Republican nor Democratic, just—gray. Perhaps my experience of disillusionment is simply a function of election depression. Or perhaps the election has been my apple, and I have eaten of it. Either way, I recall feeling like we had something—whether it was momentum, passion, or truth on our side, I’m not sure. But there was something that has faded now.\r\n\r\nThe November issue of <em>Harper’s</em>, which was released before the election, aptly demonstrates the Democrats’ obsession with presenting a united front. Ironically, it is Luke Mitchell’s essay about the Republican convention that accomplishes this, even as he lets the Democrats off the hook. He writes, “Whereas Kerry had struggled to create meaning—no matter how stupid, dishonest, or clichéd that meaning was—Bush’s team seemed actively to be plotting its demise” (67). Mitchell treats Kerry kindly, keenly aware of the approaching Tuesday. Mitchell continues, considering the discussion that took place in the Garden: “These were half-narratives, made up of questions so preposterous as to end discussion and possibly even subvert our understanding of what it means to mean something…The real message, radiating from the podium and echoing through the rafters, was that there was no message” (67). It is not difficult to imagine a covert Luke Mitchell marooned in The Red Sea, subconsciously holding his nose while straining his ears to catch the words between the echoes. The fact that he couldn’t decipher any message suggests that the Republicans know their historical precedents, too: Organization at the expense of meaning.\r\n\r\nBut now that the election is over and all may speak freely, one must wonder if Mitchell would still excuse Kerry. Perhaps not—I, for one, with hindsight shaded by the election, find his appraisal of the Republicans quite applicable to the Democrats. The Dems’ platform professes “a profound optimism about our future—an optimism that springs from our great faith in America” (Strong 1). In terms of gritty policy-talk that one might expect from a political platform, the document sounds more like a stump speech. It avoids confronting Iraq, turning that question instead into a section called “Strengthening Our Military.” It says, “We will add 40,000 new soldiers—not to increase the number of soldiers in Iraq, but to sustain our overseas deployments and prevent and prepare for other possible conflicts” (13). Worse, the title of the platform, the overall message, amounts to more of a non-message: “Strong at Home, Respected in the World.” Who can argue with such a stance? Is it a stance? The statement is eternally malleable: Anyone could mold it to his or her particular ideology. It is both isolationist and internationalist. It is both militant and gradualist. In essence, it is both liberal and conservative. It draws no lines, because it comes down on the side of no one. Even as the Dems tried to learn from history’s convenient lessons, they came up short. The Democratic message tried to be all things to all people—and still the electoral map bleeds endlessly. Perhaps we spoke directly to no one. Such is the risk of a politics of caution. In my own words, “There is too much at stake.”\r\n\r\nMitchell realizes that risk. In a later passage in his essay, he discusses the effort of the Republican convention to appear completely inoffensive, an effort I found similar to the Democrats’. He tries to recount the atmosphere of the Garden to a friend, who refers him to E.M. Forster’s <em>A Passage to India</em>. “It’s the Marabar Caves,” his friend tells him. Mitchell notes, “He was almost impossibly right.” Forster describes the caves:\r\n<blockquote>Whatever is said, the same monotonous noise replies, and quivers up and down the walls until it is absorbed into the roof. “Boum” is the sound as far as the human alphabet can express it, or “bou-oum,” or “ou-boum,”  utterly dull. Hope, politeness, the blowing of a nose, the squeak of a boot, all produce “boum”…. (68)</blockquote>\r\nIn a literal sense, the Marabar Caves recall to me the first night of the convention, when I was sitting very high up in the Fleet Center, straining my ears to hear the Clintons. The echoes were definitely overwhelming at times, and I missed much of what was said. But Mitchell cites Forster to get at something deeper. What Mitchell is concerned about is the conscious decision to sterilize discourse, to the extent that blowing one’s nose and expressions of hope both sound like “boum.” Both parties are guilty of this transgression; most likely the Republicans just play the game better. Forster realizes this, too. In the same passage, he writes, “Echoes generate echoes.” Today, echoes generate elections.\r\n\r\nAs I approached Kirkland House, my friend’s Harvard dorm, I took my earbuds out so I could concentrate on the directions he had given me. First gate on the right, proceed into the courtyard, turn left, look for the dining hall. No one had shoveled the walkway in the courtyard yet; I left footprints in the snow as I walked towards the door. Through the tall windows, I could see chandeliers and crowded tables. It looked warm inside.\r\n\r\nMonths before, we had visited this building, often late at night, so that my friend (who also interned with me) could show me where he would be living for the next three years of college. Another friend of his was spending the summer in the next house over, Eliot House, so we would go there, too, and we would have long political discussions in the night. We were like the “pink-cheeked young aides” Didion recalls in her essay, thinking of ourselves, “innocent of irony and therefore history, as ‘the best and the brightest’” (56). It rarely—if ever—occurred to me that the next time I would return, winter’s cold winds would have swooped down on the wings of the election to clear the landscape. There was an air of immortality about our convention work that summer. I assumed victory and the concomitant vindication would have taken place by now. From the heights of the Fleet Center, defeat looked impossible.\r\n\r\nIn <em>The Politics of National Party Conventions</em>, David, Goldman and Bain write: “Convention decisions cut close to the great political concerns of any society: the allocation of political power, the purposes for which political power shall be used, and the further evolution of the political system” (2). As a representative institution, as a symbol of a larger political process, the convention does not bode well for the future of politics. If the characteristics of this summer’s Democratic convention were to continue—the tendency towards insiderism, the construction of the “boum”—American politics would have some work to do before it could once again call itself a worthwhile organ of a government that pretends to democracy.\r\n\r\nEven now, in the wake of a disastrous election, the Democrats’ discussion of the future seems less interested in lasting change than more of the same. Take, for example, the theater in which a recent discussion took place. The New York Times reports that “Most of the party’s biggest names headed to former Clinton campaign adviser James Carville’s party at the old Arkansas Gazette Building, which served as the headquarters of Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign. Some partied at Doe’s Eat Place, an old Democratic hangout” (Democrats 1). That gathering sounds like a smaller version of this summer’s convention: elite figures discussing the nation’s future over cocktails. The words “old Democratic hangout” fall harshly upon my ears. But even the discourse itself comes up short. Governor Bill Richardson says, “I remember being on a trip with him in New Mexico: I put a cowboy hat on Senator Kerry and someone on his staff shuddered and asked me to stop. This is I think an example of the East Coast not connecting with the West Coast and with the rest of the country” (Nagourney 2). If Governor Richardson is right, this country is in a sad place: he believes it is more effective to pander to the “rest of the country” through empty props than actually to address issues they care about. Surely it’s less—not more—of Richardson’s theatrics that the political process needs.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I am simply unschooled in politics’ dark arts. Surely there are mysteries I cannot comprehend. After all, I am merely a has-been pink-cheeked young aide, stepping softly through the snow to meet up with my friend. If I was an insider before, by now I am a definite outsider. Apparently, you need not be one or the other to care. As for those thinking citizens, hibernating with stacks of the New Yorker, I found them in the Kirkland dining hall, discussing the Warren Court for a paper due in three days. Outside, on the trees and in the gardens, across the lawns and in the sky, the falling snow cleansed the canvas, painting over everything with a broad white stroke.

However, to say that Aciman labeled this type of thought is not to say that he was the first to experience or address it. It is actually from Wordsworth and his poem “Tintern Abbey” that Aciman borrows the idea, and it is through studying Wordsworth that Aciman recognizes his own use of mnemonic arbitrage: “What Wordsworth remembers at Tintern Abbey is not the past but himself in the past imagining the future; and what he looks forward to is not even the future, but himself, in the future, retrieving the bone he buried in the past” (151). Both Wordsworth and Aciman essentially borrow their experiences from imagination, in lieu of living within the moment.\r\n\r\nMnemonic arbitrage is not a course of thought limited to the minds of poets and scholars, however. Just as Aciman applies Wordsworth’s form of enjoyment to his periods of life in Rome, New York, and Cambridge, expanses of time during which he fantasizes about reliving in the future the ways in which these locales have reminded him of his upbringing in Egypt, so have I lived beyond the moment—most memorably on two occasions within theatrical performance. The first of these experiences occurred during a stunningly successful performance of a doubted play entitled <em>Under the Influence.</em>\r\n\r\nA collection of monologues and scenes depicting the effects on and thoughts of those associated with drug and alcohol abusers, I was afraid, in participating in the play, that audience members would feel the show was proselytizing, that the school was producing some kind of after-school special. Much to my surprise, though, when the intermission of our first performance arrived, the audience members seemed very receptive. And in the second act, yet to come, were several very well-acted, poignant scenes. By the time the show ended, and the song, “What a Wonderful World,” began, one felt an electricity within the auditorium. An emotional communion between audience and players had been wrought, and the feeling was vivifying, to say the least. But what is interesting about my experience, or rather nonexperience, is that, as I stood there on stage, what consumed my mind more than an appreciation for that moment was the envisaging of how invigorating this experience would be in retrospect. Ecstatic, my exuberance was being derived not from my immediate surroundings, but from an excitement about the value of this moment as a memory. I could not wait until I could mentally relive this moment.\r\n\r\nI had a similar experience when standing on stage during the finale of the closing performance of my high school’s musical my senior year, <em>Crazy for You.</em>The whole process of putting together that musical had been very dreamlike, as it was a fruition of my hopes for high school theatre. It had been my first time as the romantic lead in a show, and the part had several perquisites. I sang more than seven solos and duets, and even led a few tap dances (I have a secret passion for tap dancing). Realizing the opportunity to play such a role was unique, I tried to absorb each rehearsal, each step, each lyric, each nuance of each line. When the bows started for the final performance, though, it is not absorption of the congratulations that I remember; rather, I recall engaging in mnemonic arbitrage, thinking about how affirmative and special this experience would be in retrospect. I was excited about the audience’s receipt of the show not as a thing happening, but because of how vivid and emotional it would be as a memory.\r\n\r\nPerhaps mnemonic arbitrage, or the application of it to a particular experience, should be labeled first as an indicator of the significance of an experience, before addressing it as a distraction from immediate appreciation. For me, the execution of mnemonic arbitrage has occurred only at times of extreme emotion, of what would have been a most greatly-felt high: <em>those</em> moments. Those moments are of a special breed, and one is fortunate if he or she can name more than a few such moments in the past few years of his or her life. The application of mnemonic arbitrage might be looked at as a form of mental preservation—at the realization of the uniqueness, the specialness, of a situation or event, the mind seeks to ensure that that moment will be held securely within memory. The subsequence is thought of that remembering, of the product of that mnemonic preservation.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, these moments are too precious to be inhabited by our thoughts in the present, as some items of value, some artifacts, are too valuable to be tampered with as physical items. But people are free to observe these objects in museums and in photographs, and it is there that they must be appreciated. It is due to efforts at preservation, and the prohibition of usage, that generations to come may observe and enjoy the artifacts. An archaeologist, in a way, must practice a form of arbitration; however, this act is much less metaphorical and much more practical. In discovering ancient Greek vessels, for example, the archaeologist must preclude and resist handling a vase too much or, needless to say, using the artifact. The archaeologist must concern him or herself rather with the future of the object, and, in the future, being able to be still excited both about the discovery of that object and the actions of that discovery that have enabled the enjoyment of that object to continue.\r\n\r\nIt seems that in my theatrical performances, I have practiced a kind of mnemonic archaeology, uncovering a significant moment but preserving it for future appreciation. Perhaps there is something to say about the arts and their evocation of arbitrage-like experiences. For Aciman, Wordsworth’s “Tintern Abbey,” irrefutably a work of art, is a catalyst for mnemonic arbitration. Not only does Aciman recognize Wordsworth’s usage of this line of thought, but in the process of this recognition, Aciman ponders how he will be remembering this experience in the future, valuing his time in the Cambridge apartment and his essaying on Wordsworth as a memory. Perhaps, something about the heightened expression of poetry and theatre lends itself to mnemonic arbitrage. If the application of such thought is, in fact, a barometer of significance, then it seems logical that heightened experiences—expressively or otherwise—would be more likely to be the objects of mnemonic arbitrage.\r\n\r\nSomeone could very possibly apply mnemonic arbitrage to a ballet recital, thinking on how that last pirouette will be felt in a future memory; to the completion of a long-worked-upon painting, projecting how it will have felt to have applied those last few strokes of color, to have painted on that signature. It is also possible that the probability of such events being objects of mnemonic arbitrage has something to do with the “putting” of oneself into these events. An artist often claims he has put himself in whatever picture, as does Basil in Wilde’s <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em>; an actor might purport that he “exposed” himself within a particular role (or, conversely, complain that a role was frustrating because no point of personal insertion into the character could be found). These events are personalized. And because of this, the artist or performer is made vulnerable. This vulnerability could serve as an alternative explanation for the necessity of a type of “preservation.” But maybe it is not so much mental “preservation,” as it is mental “protection.” In “putting themselves out there,” artists risk something. They risk not only criticism, but also losing a part of themselves in the piece or work or performance. They risk losing themselves to their art, to the audience, to unresponsiveness, poor reception, to un-appreciation. Thus, to live in the future is to shield oneself from the dangers of living in the moment, from the perils of vulnerability.\r\n\r\nHowever, Aciman’s form of mnemonic arbitrage does not seem to involve an issue of protection, per se. One might argue, though, that there is an issue of vulnerability present. The sentimentality of Aciman’s reminiscence might be construed as a type of heightened emotion—as in the expression of artistic endeavors. Early on in “Arbitrage,” Aciman does in fact appear to be “putting” himself into the girl’s Cambridge apartment:\r\n<blockquote>Perhaps a tiny part of me was already lodged here and wished to come back again and again in the days to come, in search of that moment just after sunset when, switching on the first light and letting the windows turn to mirrors against the darkening sky, I’d watch Cambridge disappear and Alexandria rise suddenly upon the windowpanes. (149)</blockquote>\r\nTo Aciman, mnemonic arbitrage seems to be, in part, about a displacement of self. By displacing himself out of sentimentality, Aciman averts the parlous nature of sensitivity. The stuff of mnemonic arbitrage is not common. For Wordsworth, it was visits to Tintern Abbey. For Aciman, it was time in a somehow familiar and comforting Cambridge apartment, and time on the streets of New York and Rome, remembrances of a childhood in Alexandria. Personally, I experienced mnemonic arbitrage when in the midst of my passion: theatre. But whatever the nature of mnemonic arbitrage, it indubitably signifies that some event has some importance to whomever goes through it. These events are of such an importance, that there is a desired preservation of them. For memories bring to the present significance. Without memories, there is no basis for comparison, no relation to past events; the present becomes meaningless. Perhaps mnemonic arbitrage is applied when such preservation is most needed. In “Tintern Abbey,” Wordsworth captures and articulates this significance and the elemental nature of mnemonic preservation: “That in this moment there is life and food/For future years…” (Aciman 151).

(271, 5, '2011-12-19 07:49:08', '2011-12-19 07:49:08', 'In 1924, as the United States Congress debated the Johnson-Reed immigration act, Senator Ellison Smith of South Carolina took to the Senate floor to assert what he believed to be the country’s need to “shut the door.” “Without offense,” Smith ironically declared, “but with regard to the salvation of our own, let us shut the door and assimilate what we have, and let us breed pure American citizens and develop our own American resources.” While Smith believed this “purity” could best be achieved through immigration restriction harsher than that created by the already restrictive bill on the table, he was willing to vote for the bill’s quotas, as were most of his colleagues. Although Smith’s racist arguments were not indicative of the entire chamber’s calculus for vetting the bill, it was nonetheless approved with overwhelming support and signed into law the same year (“Shut the Door”).\r\n\r\nOver 80 years later, a similar scene unfolded in the halls of Congress. During a speech to the House of Representatives in September of 2006 regarding a bill which would strengthen the investigatory powers of law enforcement, Colorado Rep. Tom Tancredo invoked the supposed criminal activity of illegal immigrants in his state to garner support for what he called “our true and one single responsibility” (United States Congress). In effect, the responsibility was to deal with the increasing illegal alien population of the country, a cause with which Tancredo, the Chairman of the House Immigration Reform Caucus and author of <em>In Mortal Danger: The Battle for America’s Border and Security</em>, had long been associated (“Biography”).\r\n\r\nThe juxtaposition of these two moments in legislative history offers a glimpse into America’s seemingly never-ending conflict with immigration, particularly illegal immigration. The racism of Smith’s time evolved into the more refined nativist streak in politicians like Tancredo, one which arguably placed him to the right of his colleagues on the issue (like Smith himself). However, such an acknowledgment must be treated cautiously; perhaps the more proper angle from which to consider Tancredo’s position is in relation to the view of the American public. With equal caution, we can submit the Congressional elections of 2006 as the measuring stick with which to gauge the electorate’s perception of illegal immigration and the nativist response it may have drawn in various political circles. More complex but perhaps more relevant would be to view the election as a moment of internal struggle, the latest development of the existential conflict in which the “nation of immigrants” attempts to define itself.\r\n\r\nLess than two weeks before the midterm elections, President Bush signed a law authorizing the construction of a 700-mile fence on the border with Mexico. While many critics decried the ludicrous inefficacy and difficulty of the fence’s construction, to the shrewd political observer the intent was not pragmatism but rather political opportunism; Republicans seemed to believe that a platform highlighting immigration control would aid them in the coming election. As Michael Fletcher and Jonathan Weisman of the<em>Washington Post </em>astutely noted, the bill had backed President Bush into a corner, with “international allies and his own immigration principles on one side, and the electoral needs of his party on the other” (A04). Bush’s signing of the law effectively heralded his resignation to the political reality, an acceptance of the fence as willed by the people.\r\n\r\nTaking the passage of the fence construction bill as the definitive emergence of immigration as a Republican issue for voters in 2006, we can consider the party’s tactics in passing the law a mixed success. According to the CNN National Exit Poll for the U.S. House, of the 62% of voters who considered illegal immigration either “very” or “extremely” important in 2006, the majority voted for Republican candidates (“U.S. House of Representatives/National/Exit Poll”). On the one hand this figure seems to indicate voters’ recognition of Republican efforts on the immigration issue. However, the significant national net losses by the Republican Party might point to the relegation of the immigration issue among the priorities of the electorate. While it seems likely that the favorable response to the Republican immigration agenda was that party’s reward for pragmatic legislative effort (the mere passage of the fence bill), it is also reasonable to conclude that the average American voter did not undergo a radical ideological shift, such as an adoption of nativism as a guiding philosophy on the issue.\r\n\r\nWhether or not the election returns and the polling data on immigration specifically were a referendum on American <em>personal </em>sentiment towards immigrants, the results lend credibility to the notion that American identity is not marked by a prejudicial nativism. Moreover, if the voters approved of Republican immigration policy because of its emphasis on external (at the border) rather than internal control, the results would be in line with larger international trends. According to a study by Angel Solano Garcia which asks, “Does illegal immigration empower rightist parties?” in most developed nations where the issue is framed (and parties distinguished) by level of commitment to border enforcement, voters tend to heavily favor right-wing parties when they connect illegal immigration to a sense of insecurity (652). This projection validates the statistics provided by the CNN exit poll that asked voters what should be done with “most” illegal immigrants currently living in the U.S. 57% of respondents said that illegal residents should be “offered legal status,” while 38% favored deportation (“U.S. House of Representatives/ National/Exit Poll”). The willingness of the majority to grant amnesty (a term as fervently avoided by many politicians as a scarlet letter of treason) in some form to illegal immigrants would seem to preclude any evidence of nativist bias among most voters. Of course, the 38% minority in support of deportation is significant, and we can speculate that those voters responded to the “border security is national security” trope. Even if the distinction between the two responding constituencies is conditioned by the influence of nativism on the part of the minority, it would adhere to Garcia’s model, given the fact that 56% of that minority voted for Republican candidates (“U.S. House of Representatives/National/Exit Poll”).\r\n\r\nThe national data is useful to the extent that it can help us form a picture of the average voter’s attitude towards the parties’ portrayal of the illegal immigration issue, as well as their respective success in reconciling pragmatic security concerns with heavier moral ones. By isolating certain races of note in 2006, we can build on that portrait in order to better understand how such considerations were weighed on a more local level. The southwest region is the most likely candidate for closer observation in any immigration study, owing to its higher concentration of illegal immigrants and the tendency for that presence to pervade the realm of state and local politics. In Arizona’s fifth congressional district, the defeat of Rep. J.D. Hayworth was hailed by many supporters of the “path to citizenship” plan for alien residents as a symbolic victory for their cause, part of an overall American repudiation of conservative restrictive policies (Archibold).\r\n\r\nAt first glance, it seems reasonable to conclude that voters rejected Hayworth’s relatively “hardline” position on illegal immigration. Hayworth, like Congressman Tancredo, authored a book on the subject entitled <em>Whatever it Takes</em>, which sparked controversy both in his district and nationally for, among other things, its employment of a quotation from Henry Ford (Giblin). In addition, the <em>Arizona Republic</em>, an influential community publication, called Hayworth a “bully,” and asserted that the district needed “a bridge-builder, not a bomb-thrower” (Myers). If we were to assume that these characterizations represent a prevalent view of Hayworth within his district, we would concurrently assume that the voters of the fifth district favored tempered rhetoric and moderation of policy (in the hope that it would lead to pragmatic legislative achievement) over more fiery, divisive postures.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the presence on the statewide ballot of Proposition 103 complicates such an assessment. Proposition 103, which called for the adoption of English as the official language of Arizona as well as the limitation of multilingual government programs, was passed with 74.2% of the vote (“Voters Make English”). Traditionally, measures such as this one have been perceived as the hallmark of the modern nativist effort. Why then did an overwhelming expression of statewide disapproval for the intrusion of immigrant language into American communities not translate into a victory for Hayworth and his restrictive platform? After all, the characterization of the passage by one leader of the English-first campaign, Mauro Mujica, as Arizona’s call for “assimilation, not separation”, was strikingly reminiscent of what was <em>rejected</em> by many as nativism in Hayworth’s<em>Whatever it Takes </em>(“Voters Make English”). “Instead of Americanization,” Hayworth wrote, current policy offers “bilingual education, racial and ethnic quotas, and education that focuses not on American heroes and culture, but on a potpourri of ethnic heroes and cultures” (qtd. in Giblin).\r\n\r\nUnless popular opinion in the 5th district differs extraordinarily from that of Arizona as a whole, it seems clear that Hayworth’s support for “Americanism” rather than so-called “multiculturalism” was not the voters’ chief grievance with their congressman. Overall, Arizonans may have felt that in fact, the defense of English (and perhaps transitively in their minds, the defense of strictly “American” culture) was as essential a tool on the illegal immigration front as physical border security itself. But the fact that Proposition 103 was passed irrespective of party or ideological affiliation—exit polls indicate the measure was approved by 54% and 53% of Democrats and Liberals, respectively—shows that while Hayworth may have been on the right side of the issue for some voters, like many Republicans nationwide he may simply have been a member of the wrong party for this election (“Ballot Measures/Arizona Proposition 103/Exit Poll”).\r\n\r\nHowever, even support for Proposition 103 does not lend itself to the embrace of nativism as a guiding philosophy without reservation. Exit polling estimates that 55% of all Arizona voters supported the granting of legal status to current illegal residents (“Ballot Measures/Arizona Proposition 103/Exit Poll”). It is this statistic more than any other that exposes the suggested “existential conflict” over immigration. The stated motives of proponents of Proposition 103 are designed to distance, or even reject, an explicit nativism. Consider the rationale offered by Arizona State Rep. Russell Pearce to voters considering the Proposition that “Official English promotes unity” and “empowers immigrants” (“Ballot argument FOR Proposition 103”). If sincere, these assertions could hardly be considered anti-immigrant. Rather, they, along with Pearce’s contention that the measure will eliminate government waste, appeal to an <em>inclusive</em> persuasion. Therefore, the “existential conflict” is essentially the struggle to reconcile Americans’ tendency towards the so-called “Americanism” and “Americanization” with the previously embraced “melting pot” theory of societal development. The difficulty lies in validating the belief that these new systems allow for an equally smooth and efficient integration of an immigrant population into American communities.\r\n\r\nFurther, Rep. Hayworth’s framing of the issue sheds light on the rhetorical ambiguity surrounding this conflict. It is doubtful that most supporters of English-first legislation, such as Mujica, would assert that assimilation through language (and perhaps other responsibilities of American citizenship) mandates the purging of ethnic identity. Rather, their philosophy accepts the ethnic “potpourri,” which Hayworth decried, as a viable part of American life. Indeed, most would maintain that a confluence of ethnic traditions created and continues to create American culture, rather than threaten it. It is clear then that their call for “assimilation” is far more benign than Hayworth’s “Americanization,” which seems to equate the adoption of English with that of an exceedingly narrow view of American identity. And inevitably, this view of identity is based in potentially harmful racial distinctions, rather than inclusive patriotic sentiment.\r\n\r\nOf course, Arizona cannot legitimately be considered a microcosm for the entire United States. As the national polling data indicated, American voters may have been less concerned with immigrant integration than Arizonans were when they voted in 2006. Therefore a consideration of a case outside of the southwest, a region we might even consider “tainted” for study given the way in which the economic and cultural effects of immigration may prejudice votes, can be used to return to a more general study of national opinion. The election in the sixth District of Illinois, another one of the key swing races in 2006, may illuminate how illegal immigration was used or misused as an issue among the rest of the electorate.\r\n\r\nThe race in the sixth district pitted Democrat Tammy Duckworth, an Iraq war veteran, against Peter Roskam, a Republican state legislator (“The 2006 Campaign”). Not surprisingly given Duckworth’s combat experience, Democratic strategists hoped to use this race to emphasize their party’s commitment to national security and defense issues, which were traditionally in the Republican corner. Also not surprising given the national dissatisfaction with Iraq was Roskam’s refusal to make that war a major focus of his campaign. However, he did not shy away from the issue of illegal immigration, a decision which ultimately may have greatly helped him secure victory. Roskam opposed the “path to citizenship” legislation and supported fence construction on the border (“Border Security/Illegal Immigration”).\r\n\r\nBy conventional standards, Roskam’s decision to incorporate immigration into the debate is rather puzzling. Considering the overall national distaste for the Republican record, sticking to the prevailing wisdom of treating local issues primarily in a House race would have been the logical strategy. If a Republican candidate were to widen the discourse to the national scale, they would open themselves up to attacks based more on party affiliation than on personal record. However, Roskam did just that, allowing illegal immigration to come into play as the primary issue in the national security field.\r\n\r\nIt was certainly not the issue Democrats had hoped would emerge. But the question remains: why would voters respond favorably to Roskam’s posturing on illegal immigration when the issue affected their district only tangentially? While we cannot assume that Roskam won solely on this point of contention, it undoubtedly played a role in his victory. One reasonable inference is that the voters of the Illinois 6th considered immigration an<em>economic</em> threat first and foremost. Perhaps the same protectionist sentiment ridden by some Democratic candidates, such as Rep. Sherrod Brown in the Ohio Senate race, to victory in 2006 aided Roskam in this case in the sense that voters were attentive to the potential economic consequences of expanded immigration and amnesty. If voters supported Roskam’s campaign platform, which stated, “We are a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of laws,” we can identify a new voice in the existential debate, one that hearkens to the call of immigration control not out of bias or even the integration of “Americanism” (“Border Security/Illegal Immigration”). Rather, this constituency responds to a sense of “crowding”—the imposition of immigrant economic needs (not cultural ones) on the country. As the sixth district shows us, the crowding can be just as potent hundreds of miles from the source.\r\n\r\nWhile the 2006 Election failed to produce a clear consensus on immigration, it cemented the status of the issue as far more complex and relevant than previous agents of electoral polarization. Indeed, we now see that immigration is not a polemic of the same fabric as the much-hyped “moral values” debate of 2004; the issue is impaired by hyperbole yet rejects the tendency to divide along traditional regional and social contours. The identity crisis observed among the American electorate is one which will continue to compound the national immigration debate, fostering a confused politics in which voters are unable to define themselves according to philosophies traditionally recognized by politicians. Still, perhaps only by recognizing the impossibility of settling this internal discord—of reaching a cultural consensus—will we reject the disquieting politics of anxiety that currently reigns in public discourse.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'A Conflict of Culture or Conscience: Re-reading the 2006 Election', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'a-conflict-of-culture-or-conscience-re-reading-the-2006-election', '', '', '2012-04-10 15:38:00', '2012-04-10 15:38:00', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=271', 0, 'essay', '', 0);

(272, 5, '2011-12-19 07:49:34', '2011-12-19 07:49:34', 'In 1933, Federico García Lorca delivered a lecture entitled “Play and Theory of the Duende.” In it he speaks of the phenomenon of “duende”, a demon-like spirit represented as an irrational being with an intense correlation to raw passion, desperation and a heightened awareness of death and suffering. Lorca gives his audience a glimpse into the elusive nature of duende and exposes its presence in Spanish cultural folklore. However, his true purpose was to critique rationalism in the arts, specifically the performing arts. By pointing out the differences between those who are guided or ordered by angels or muses and those who possess duende, Lorca expresses his disdain towards intellectualism and traditionalism in the process of creative thinking. Lorca defends the exploration of the unconscious, the primitive, and the intuitive as the true sources of the very substance of art; by doing so, he challenges the traditional notions of artistic conception and interpretation. In his appeal for a more sensuous approach to the arts, Lorca gives little or no credit to rational methods like mastery of the necessary skills. While not opposing Lorca’s claim that the unconscious plays an important role in artistic expression, this paper will argue that hard work, knowledge of the craft, and a deep awareness of man and nature are also fundamental parts of the process of expressing creative power and originality. Artistic expression might find its inspiration in different sources, but discipline and training will always be intrinsic to the creative process.\r\n\r\nFederico García Lorca, a member of the “Generación del 27” avant-garde movement of 1920’s Spain, like many of his contemporary colleagues, endeavored to produce a drastic change in art by creating a bridge between art and the masses. He, like Picasso, Dalí, and Miró, turned his back on traditional art techniques to give birth to a Spanish revolution in art that had its roots in his political views. For the avant-garde artist, “art absorbs the slang, notions and problems of modern life…it wants to destroy the hierarchy of art forms, to efface the dividing lines between ‘high’ and ‘low’ all in order to get closer to the public and overcome the alienating effect of the division of labor” (Szabolcsi 56). This notion is reflected in Lorca’s “Play and Theory of the Duende,” with its exaltation of duende and Spanish folklore. Lorca not only elevates Spanish popular interpreters and performers to the heights of recognized artistic figures like Apollinaire and Becquer, but he implies that art must connect with the public to avoid becoming futile. “Here we care nothing about ability, technique, skill” (Lorca 53). Lorca voices the reaction of an audience unimpressed with the superior technical abilities of a flamenco singer. In turn, the audience demands duende, which they can recognize and truly appreciate.\r\n\r\n“Play and Theory of the Duende,” from beginning to end, is full of criticism and scorn towards traditional values found within contemporary Spanish cultural society. Lorca begins his lecture with great disdain towards his formative academic years as a student at the “Residencia de Estudiantes” in Madrid; he calls those years studying Philosophy and Letters boring. He continues his censure by giving voice to the gypsy dancer who liked Brailowski, but was bored by Glück, Brahms, and Milhaud. Lorca looks upon intellect and inspiration as limiting and restrictive forces and similarly assesses the muse and angel as sources of creativity. He instead defines duende as the true source of creative self-expression. Lorca’s duende “is a power, not a work…it is not a question of ability, but of true, living style, of blood, of the most ancient culture, of spontaneous creation” and nowhere is this power better exhibited than in the Spanish popular culture (49). Lorca, through his assessment of the idiosyncratic elements of Spanish folklore, makes his case for a more primitive approach towards the conception of art.\r\n\r\nIn his essay “Freedom in Art,” John Tuttle discusses contemporary movements that, like the avant-garde, promote the departure from traditional notions of art conception and appreciation:\r\n<blockquote>A typical manifestation of the conception of free individual expression is primitivism. In revolting from academicism, tradition, and the arduous discipline imposed by the past, it is only natural that artists turn to the spontaneous art of the child, the work of simple, untaught artists of the present or of earlier periods…also that of primitive men, both prehistoric and contemporary. Here, it is felt, art shines forth more purely, without the encrustations of individual and racial training and without the damaging influence which the mind is considered to exert on the free, untrammeled expression of artistic impulses. (46, 47)</blockquote>\r\nTuttle considers this view of freedom in artistic expression as narrow. He admits that the unconscious plays a role in artistic imagination, but he contends that “the idea that there is a sacred inner self, always ready to yield up something significant or valuable for expression in art is a fiction, a piece of ungrounded mysticism” (Tuttle 47). He argues that a person “achieves a creative artistic power only through work, through training, through breadth and richness of experience” (Tuttle 49). Creative power, rather than the expression of an obscure inner self, is a force strengthened by the combination of the elements of training and practice. Originality then is the outcome of ability, experience, and deep understanding of the craft.\r\n\r\nFlamenco and bullfighting are Spain’s unique forms of popular artistic expression. Lorca presents them as mystical expressions of art. His flamenco singers become vessels of magical powers that awe their audiences with passionate performances that are only achieved through their abandonment to duende. His bullfighters can only achieve artistic truth with duende’s help. While the Spanish culture has one of the most mystical souls of Western culture, the perpetuation of its cultural roots is a product of traditionalism rather than improvisation. The seemingly impromptu displays of fevered emotion are yet another traditional form of artistic expression. Pastora Pavón, the famous Andalusian singer endorsed by Lorca, whose remarkable performances won her international fame, is said to have possessed much duende. Nonetheless, Pavón also possessed an “extraordinarily flexible voice” and “technical perfection” that enabled her freedom to sing “not only well, but magnificently” (Volland 2). Sanchez Mejias, another of Lorca’s duende-infused bullfighters, gave performances that were described as irrational and impulsive. However, Timothy J. Mitchell, in his essay “Bullfighting: the Ritual Origin of Scholarly Myths,” describes Sanchez Mejias as far from reckless: “Sanchez Mejias was not a kamikaze. It was paradoxically his mastery of technical resources and ingenious tricks that enabled him to make such a convincing show of his careless courage” (407).\r\n\r\nThe Gypsies have practiced flamenco for centuries and it is their personal history that transfuses flamenco with pain and dramatic expression. Peter Manuel, in his study “Andalusian, Gypsy, and Class Identity in the Contemporary Flamenco Complex,” asserts that “the sense of Andalusian oppression has been a central theme in flamenco…” (48). The Gypsy awareness of his social and political identity is what makes flamenco unique in its form. As Peter Manuel writes: “Also valued in Flamenco are stylistic features…such as raspy vocal timbre, [and] sobbing-like falsetto breaks…The latter features have been interpreted as reflecting the sense of struggle and adversity so central to the Andalusian aesthetic and identity” (55). Flamenco performers, more than raw passion, possess a deep understanding of the Gypsy character and thousands of years of flamenco tradition. Lorca’s flamenco artists, beyond mystical power, own the confidence gained through training that allows them to express themselves freely. Even if the technique used is simple, their mastery of the form allows them to forget about the act itself, which gives way to the true emotion that they want to communicate.\r\n\r\nSetting aside the notion of duende, Lorca’s mystical bullfighters exuded the confidence gained through achieving expertise. Lagartijo with his Roman duende, Joselito with his Jewish duende, Belmonte with his Baroque duende, and Cagancho with his Gypsy duende, were nonetheless true professionals of the craft. Mitchell observes that bullfighting “constitutes a traditional body of knowledge and practices” that “requires a highly sophisticated understanding of animal behavior, adherence to very specific norms and procedures, and a fair degree of nerve in carrying them out” (396). Even when the bullfighter puts on a performance that is more than pure technique, even before duende can make an appearance and take over the body, mastery of the craft is obligatory. Notions of geometry enable the bullfighter to measure the distance between him and the bull, understanding of the bull’s nature to calculate its movements. The bullfighter actions are both premeditated and rational: “even moments of panic and flight are prone to aesthetic elaboration” (Mitchell 404). Mitchell further emphasizes this point by asserting, “the fact remains that the craft itself has been shaped cerebrally, by the precedence of intelligence over strength, strategy over raw courage, brains over brawn” (407). Duende might represent the emotion that the bullfighter pours into his performance, but above all, great dexterity and command of technique determine the freedom of his performance.\r\n\r\nLorca brought popular culture to the attention of the intellectual community in an effort to reduce the gap between the Spanish social strata; in so doing he also revitalized the regional culture. “García Lorca was the most prominent modern poet to bridge the gap between rustic, often illiterate Gypsy singers and the literary intellectual world” (Manuel 53). “Play and Theory of the Duende” brings the musician Manuel Torre and the bullfighter Cagancho, performers who might never have reached star quality without Lorca’s endorsement, to center stage. Lorca also gives voice to an otherwise unknown Ignacio Espeleta, who was proud to be from Cádiz, building on the nationalistic pride of Lorca’s presentation. Lorca’s social dissatisfactions might have turned his artistic faculties to more ordinary issues like the impoverished Gypsies and might have influenced his dislike towards the conventions of the academy, but his observations are the result of intellectual analysis. His awareness of the disadvantages of the poor and his knowledge of politics are part of what allows Lorca to voice his criticism towards the exclusiveness of the artistic realm. His intellectual faculties are the tools that enable him to express his views. He draws from the vast well of academic resources to produce prose and verse that reflect the confidence of one who knows his craft. The force that drives Lorca’s passionate voice, then, is not\r\n<blockquote>…merely subjective impulse, irrationality, an introverted and esoteric imagination, the repudiation of tradition and discipline, or a recourse to primitivism. It implies, on the contrary, a perception of the potential universality of the human spirit; a responsibility to artistic truth; a use of the whole mind—including intelligence, imagination, emotion, and more—in the service of artistic creation; an imaginative activity which is not turned primarily inward, but which looks out on the broad world of nature and humanity. (Tuttle 53)</blockquote>\r\nLorca puts the best of his abilities to the service of a greater truth: creating awareness about the importance of a national identity that represents all the layers of its social composition. Making use of his intellectual capabilities and his knowledge of Spain’s cultural folklore, Lorca presents to us an exquisite study of the mystical soul of Spain and some of its most influential artistic figures.\r\n\r\nWhile Lorca is content to criticize the intellectualization of art in the academy, he nonetheless has given us his intellectual expression in his lecture “Play and Theory of the Duende.” Therefore, in an unconscious way, Lorca supports the very claim to intellectualization he seeks to refute. Lorca’s work represents its author’s intellectual breadth, exceptional rhetorical skills and deep awareness of Spanish cultural identity.', 'Lorca: Against Intellectualism', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'lorca-against-intellectualism', '', '', '2012-03-23 15:29:10', '2012-03-23 15:29:10', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=272', 0, 'essay', '', 0),

As planes crashed and buildings fell, the word “terrorism” took on a new and frightening meaning, and America, which previously had been thought immune to such an attack, was left yearning for the feeling of safety and security that had so quickly been stripped from it. The monster born of that moment—the Terrorist—is one that Americans have fought and feared for five years now.\r\n\r\nIt must be understood that the Terrorist exists solely in the minds of Americans; while the threat of terrorism is certainly a reality, our fears and imaginations, fueled by media sensationalism and presidential rhetoric, have transformed the human terrorist (specifically that of militant Islam) into the superhuman “Terrorist”—an entirely irrational and unstoppable being whose only “goal is to…strike America and other free nations with ever-increasing violence” (President Bush, October 6, 2005). This distinction between the real and the imaginary is important, as it is only the latter to which we can apply Monster Theory—a set of seven theses proposed by Jeffrey Cohen which govern the nature and implications of monsters created within a particular cultural context.\r\n\r\nCohen’s essay, “Monster Culture (Seven Theses),” makes the claim that at the point at which a culture is forced to reexamine its values (for instance, the willingness to embrace homosexuality) lays a monster (in this case, Francis Ford Coppola’s homoerotic portrait of Dracula). He states that monsters “ask us to reevaluate our cultural assumptions about race, gender, sexuality, our perception of difference, our tolerance toward its expression” (20). However, it seems that “Monster Culture”, specifically when it is applied to the Terrorist, can force us to reevaluate larger issues, even the values most inherent to our culture.\r\n\r\nThe first of Cohen’s seven theses states that “the Monster’s body quite literally incorporates fear, desire, anxiety, and fantasy….The monstrous body is pure culture” (4). This seems to be fairly rational; as monsters are created for a particular audience, it is only logical to assume that they are constructed to fit the particularities of that audience. Of course, it must be understood that Cohen is speaking for the monsters of the fictional world, those that we find in literature and film. The Terrorist is unlike any of these monsters in that he is not simply a pop culture phenomenon—he is, in part, a reality. His every detail cannot be altered to fit a particular cultural mentality in the way that Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein or Bram Stoker’s Dracula can. However, though many pieces of the Terrorist’s story are set in factual stone, the Terrorist has been subjected to half a decade of rumor, media hype, and the collective imagination of the American people. Language used when describing the Terrorist has ranged from mild and almost playful (consider the popular “Wanted Dead or Alive: Osama Bin Laden” stickers) to downright slanderous and bigoted (such as talk radio host Michael Graham’s assertion that Islam is essentially “a terrorist organization”), yet has remained universally negative. Such a strong opinion, combined with a lack of cultural knowledge, has caused us to accentuate and even falsely attach certain characteristics to terrorists, breeding this new monster—one that is based partly upon our observations and partly upon our imaginations. The Terrorist, therefore, is no exception to Cohen’s first thesis: though he holds his basis in fact, he is similar to fictional monsters in that he reflects the fears of the culture in which he was created and, as the obvious antagonist, serves as the antithesis to that culture’s values.\r\n\r\nCohen goes on to assert that, because monsters are geared toward a particular people, the study of certain monsters can reveal worlds about the cultures to which they belong. “A construct and a projection,” he says, “the monster exists only to be read” (4). A thorough “reading” of the Terrorist—through his descriptions in political speeches, popular media, and private conversations—can therefore provide invaluable insight into America’s current collective mindset. For instance, “freedom-hating” is an epithet commonly ascribed to the Terrorist, as it is generally assumed that we are attacked simply for having those rights that come with a secular democracy. While this is, for the most part, untrue (a majority of terrorists are, ironically, striking back at the institutions which they see as oppressing their own rights to self-determination and freedom), it is nonetheless a part of our construction of the Terrorist, and our value system is clearly reflected in such an image. In much the same way that the homosexual undertones in Bram Stoker’s Dracula exposed the negativity of the public’s heterosexism, the phrase “freedom-hating” paints a favorable picture of America as a country that values free will over authority. Other descriptions are just as telling: the depiction of the Middle Eastern countries in which the Terrorist resides as oppressing women and denying their people certain liberties shows the pride we take in the ideas expressed in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights; media portrayals of Arabs as violent and bloodthirsty (such as those during the recent riots over cartoon drawings of Mohammed) tell of a country that values peace over war and passivity over violence; the simple diction of the labels “extremist” and “fundamentalist” depict an America which values bipartisanship over single-minded leadership and free thought over blindfolded faith.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is not new information. We know that freedom and liberty are at the core of America’s values, that senseless violence and religious extremism have long been frowned upon by American society. However, in his final two theses, Cohen reaches two startling conclusions, the first being that our “fear of the monster is really a kind of desire” (16). According to Cohen, the reason we enjoy the experience of monster stories (and by extension, the reason that, despite not having been attacked in five years, we are still glued to our television sets every time the Terrorist is mentioned) is not so much the thrill of fear, but the ability to see our subconscious desires embodied in the monster. “We distrust and loathe the monster at the same time we envy [it]” (17). Therefore, if Monster Culture theory truly applies to the Terrorist, it must be able to shed light on some quality unique to the Terrorist that we, the American people, desire. But what could the Terrorist, the violent, “freedom-hating” being burning holes in our television sets, possibly have that we do not?\r\n\r\nThe answer, once again, can be found in the qualities that we have imparted to our monster. When we see the videos in which soon-to-be-terrorists (not individuals in our minds, but manifestations of the larger Terrorist) describe their plans and hopes televised on CNN and cable news, we often wonder at the sheer ignorance of the Terrorist, who believes that he is carrying out the will of God and that he will receive tremendous repayment beyond the grave for murdering himself and others. Yet there is something haunting about that confident stare and those strong words, and one must wonder if ignorance is indeed bliss. The Terrorist, despite his monstrosity, is completely and utterly secure. We secretly envy the Terrorist because, though he is without freedom, he does not need it. He is sure of his place in the world, fully convinced of his own righteousness, and afraid of nothing, not even death. Other societies and peoples have gone to great lengths to achieve such security: many have foregone free thought by joining cults and fundamentalist religions for religious security; entire peoples have supported and fought for fascist governments for physical security; nations have constructed and defended horrendously oppressive institutions (such as slavery in the United States) to provide financial security. After we see the Terrorist speaking with such conviction in his latest video publication, we subconsciously begin to wonder if life would be better if we were to trade a little freedom for security.\r\n\r\nIn his last thesis, Cohen simultaneously reaches his conclusion and his climax, stating that “the monster stands at the threshold…of becoming” (20). Because monsters are simply the manifestation of certain desires of the society in which they are created, Cohen states that they generally serve as a prelude to a cultural shift in which the society embraces those qualities embodied in the monster. Monsters can create “a revolution in the very logic of meaning”, he asserts, and the Terrorist has certainly created such a revolution in the minds of Americans (7). Over the past five years, we have allowed many of our democratic rights and values—those same values of free thought, free will, free speech, and peace that seem so alive in our snide references to the “freedom-hating terrorist”—to slowly fade away. The Patriot Act impinges on our freedom from illegal search and seizure, wire-tapping programs are defended as necessary for security, newspaper articles exposing the administration’s torture programs are cut or criticized for posing a “threat to national security,” and we have buried ourselves militarily and financially in a war that is both pointless and endless. One might argue that we are indeed better off; such grievances are, comparatively speaking, minute, and do not affect the average American. Furthermore, these measures seem to have kept terrorism off our shores for the five years they have been in place. However, by continuing down this path we risk everything we value. Cohen states: “the monster stands as a warning against exploration of its uncertain demesnes…to step outside this official geography is to risk…becom[ing] monstrous oneself” (12). That is not to say that the Patriot Act will transform Americans into terrorists, but one could imagine how, given the right course of events, a democratic people would sacrifice more and more of its rights until it fell into a sort of de facto fascism, essentially becoming the monster it hates so much.\r\n\r\nOur monster, therefore, is unlike those Cohen describes in that he is a legitimate warning against exploration rather than a scarecrow established in order to maintain the status quo. Past monsters have served as warnings against sexual promiscuity (the temptress demons of <em>Queste del Saint Graal</em>), homosexuality (<em>Dracula</em>), communism (the Hollywood-invading ants of the 1950s horror movie<em>Them!</em>), and even against interfering with established monopolies (the serpents depicted at the edges of trade routes allegedly dreamt up by powerful medieval sea merchants) (13). The Terrorist, however, serves as a warning against sacrificed freedom. To heed this warning would not be to limit ourselves as in the examples above, but to preserve our way of life. In the case of the Terrorist, the status quo is favorable, and exploration of the monster’s world, where freedom is viewed as a threat, should be avoided at all costs.\r\n\r\nFive years ago, as we emerged from the chaos of 9/11 trying to make sense of this new and frightening world in which even the US is vulnerable, we looked into the eyes of the monster and for an instant saw something desirable, something we desperately needed, and, to a certain degree, we’ve obtained it. Where we go from here depends upon the terrorists’ actions and upon how rationally we are able to approach our fears. The one thing we can be sure of, however, is that, as Cohen states, “the monster always escapes,” and the Terrorist, alongside the threat of our own impulses, will always haunt us (4).', 'Monster Culture in Post-9/11 America', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'monster-culture-in-post-911-america', '', '', '2012-03-23 15:31:55', '2012-03-23 15:31:55', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=273', 0, 'essay', '', 0),
(414, 8, '2012-02-27 14:18:53', '2012-02-27 14:18:53', 'In 1933, Federico García Lorca delivered a lecture entitled “Play and Theory of the Duende.” In it he speaks of the phenomenon of “duende”, a demon-like spirit represented as an irrational being with an intense correlation to raw passion, desperation and a heightened awareness of death and suffering. Lorca gives his audience a glimpse into the elusive nature of duende and exposes its presence in Spanish cultural folklore. However, his true purpose was to critique rationalism in the arts, specifically the performing arts. By pointing out the differences between those who are guided or ordered by angels or muses and those who possess duende, Lorca expresses his disdain towards intellectualism and traditionalism in the process of creative thinking. Lorca defends the exploration of the unconscious, the primitive, and the intuitive as the true sources of the very substance of art; by doing so, he challenges the traditional notions of artistic conception and interpretation. In his appeal for a more sensuous approach to the arts, Lorca gives little or no credit to rational methods like mastery of the necessary skills. While not opposing Lorca’s claim that the unconscious plays an important role in artistic expression, this paper will argue that hard work, knowledge of the craft, and a deep awareness of man and nature are also fundamental parts of the process of expressing creative power and originality. Artistic expression might find its inspiration in different sources, but discipline and training will always be intrinsic to the creative process.\r\n\r\nFederico García Lorca, a member of the “Generación del 27” avant-garde movement of 1920’s Spain, like many of his contemporary colleagues, endeavored to produce a drastic change in art by creating a bridge between art and the masses. He, like Picasso, Dalí, and Miró, turned his back on traditional art techniques to give birth to a Spanish revolution in art that had its roots in his political views. For the avant-garde artist, “art absorbs the slang, notions and problems of modern life…it wants to destroy the hierarchy of art forms, to efface the dividing lines between ‘high’ and ‘low’ all in order to get closer to the public and overcome the alienating effect of the division of labor” (Szabolcsi 56). This notion is reflected in Lorca’s “Play and Theory of the Duende,” with its exaltation of duende and Spanish folklore. Lorca not only elevates Spanish popular interpreters and performers to the heights of recognized artistic figures like Apollinaire and Becquer, but he implies that art must connect with the public to avoid becoming futile. “Here we care nothing about ability, technique, skill” (Lorca 53). Lorca voices the reaction of an audience unimpressed with the superior technical abilities of a flamenco singer. In turn, the audience demands duende, which they can recognize and truly appreciate.\r\n\r\n“Play and Theory of the Duende,” from beginning to end, is full of criticism and scorn towards traditional values found within contemporary Spanish cultural society. Lorca begins his lecture with great disdain towards his formative academic years as a student at the “Residencia de Estudiantes” in Madrid; he calls those years studying Philosophy and Letters boring. He continues his censure by giving voice to the gypsy dancer who liked Brailowski, but was bored by Glück, Brahms, and Milhaud. Lorca looks upon intellect and inspiration as limiting and restrictive forces and similarly assesses the muse and angel as sources of creativity. He instead defines duende as the true source of creative self-expression. Lorca’s duende “is a power, not a work…it is not a question of ability, but of true, living style, of blood, of the most ancient culture, of spontaneous creation” and nowhere is this power better exhibited than in the Spanish popular culture (49). Lorca, through his assessment of the idiosyncratic elements of Spanish folklore, makes his case for a more primitive approach towards the conception of art.\r\n\r\nIn his essay “Freedom in Art,” John Tuttle discusses contemporary movements that, like the avant-garde, promote the departure from traditional notions of art conception and appreciation:\r\n<blockquote>A typical manifestation of the conception of free individual expression is primitivism. In revolting from academicism, tradition, and the arduous discipline imposed by the past, it is only natural that artists turn to the spontaneous art of the child, the work of simple, untaught artists of the present or of earlier periods…also that of primitive men, both prehistoric and contemporary. Here, it is felt, art shines forth more purely, without the encrustations of individual and racial training and without the damaging influence which the mind is considered to exert on the free, untrammeled expression of artistic impulses. (46, 47)</blockquote>\r\nTuttle considers this view of freedom in artistic expression as narrow. He admits that the unconscious plays a role in artistic imagination, but he contends that “the idea that there is a sacred inner self, always ready to yield up something significant or valuable for expression in art is a fiction, a piece of ungrounded mysticism” (Tuttle 47). He argues that a person “achieves a creative artistic power only through work, through training, through breadth and richness of experience” (Tuttle 49). Creative power, rather than the expression of an obscure inner self, is a force strengthened by the combination of the elements of training and practice. Originality then is the outcome of ability, experience, and deep understanding of the craft.\r\n\r\nFlamenco and bullfighting are Spain’s unique forms of popular artistic expression. Lorca presents them as mystical expressions of art. His flamenco singers become vessels of magical powers that awe their audiences with passionate performances that are only achieved through their abandonment to duende. His bullfighters can only achieve artistic truth with duende’s help. While the Spanish culture has one of the most mystical souls of Western culture, the perpetuation of its cultural roots is a product of traditionalism rather than improvisation. The seemingly impromptu displays of fevered emotion are yet another traditional form of artistic expression. Pastora Pavón, the famous Andalusian singer endorsed by Lorca, whose remarkable performances won her international fame, is said to have possessed much duende. Nonetheless, Pavón also possessed an “extraordinarily flexible voice” and “technical perfection” that enabled her freedom to sing “not only well, but magnificently” (Volland 2). Sanchez Mejias, another of Lorca’s duende-infused bullfighters, gave performances that were described as irrational and impulsive. However, Timothy J. Mitchell, in his essay “Bullfighting: the Ritual Origin of Scholarly Myths,” describes Sanchez Mejias as far from reckless: “Sanchez Mejias was not a kamikaze. It was paradoxically his mastery of technical resources and ingenious tricks that enabled him to make such a convincing show of his careless courage” (407).\r\n\r\nThe Gypsies have practiced flamenco for centuries and it is their personal history that transfuses flamenco with pain and dramatic expression. Peter Manuel, in his study “Andalusian, Gypsy, and Class Identity in the Contemporary Flamenco Complex,” asserts that “the sense of Andalusian oppression has been a central theme in flamenco…” (48). The Gypsy awareness of his social and political identity is what makes flamenco unique in its form. As Peter Manuel writes: “Also valued in Flamenco are stylistic features…such as raspy vocal timbre, [and] sobbing-like falsetto breaks…The latter features have been interpreted as reflecting the sense of struggle and adversity so central to the Andalusian aesthetic and identity” (55). Flamenco performers, more than raw passion, possess a deep understanding of the Gypsy character and thousands of years of flamenco tradition. Lorca’s flamenco artists, beyond mystical power, own the confidence gained through training that allows them to express themselves freely. Even if the technique used is simple, their mastery of the form allows them to forget about the act itself, which gives way to the true emotion that they want to communicate.\r\n\r\nSetting aside the notion of duende, Lorca’s mystical bullfighters exuded the confidence gained through achieving expertise. Lagartijo with his Roman duende, Joselito with his Jewish duende, Belmonte with his Baroque duende, and Cagancho with his Gypsy duende, were nonetheless true professionals of the craft. Mitchell observes that bullfighting “constitutes a traditional body of knowledge and practices” that “requires a highly sophisticated understanding of animal behavior, adherence to very specific norms and procedures, and a fair degree of nerve in carrying them out” (396). Even when the bullfighter puts on a performance that is more than pure technique, even before duende can make an appearance and take over the body, mastery of the craft is obligatory. Notions of geometry enable the bullfighter to measure the distance between him and the bull, understanding of the bull’s nature to calculate its movements. The bullfighter actions are both premeditated and rational: “even moments of panic and flight are prone to aesthetic elaboration” (Mitchell 404). Mitchell further emphasizes this point by asserting, “the fact remains that the craft itself has been shaped cerebrally, by the precedence of intelligence over strength, strategy over raw courage, brains over brawn” (407). Duende might represent the emotion that the bullfighter pours into his performance, but above all, great dexterity and command of technique determine the freedom of his performance.\r\n\r\nLorca brought popular culture to the attention of the intellectual community in an effort to reduce the gap between the Spanish social strata; in so doing he also revitalized the regional culture. “García Lorca was the most prominent modern poet to bridge the gap between rustic, often illiterate Gypsy singers and the literary intellectual world” (Manuel 53). “Play and Theory of the Duende” brings the musician Manuel Torre and the bullfighter Cagancho, performers who might never have reached star quality without Lorca’s endorsement, to center stage. Lorca also gives voice to an otherwise unknown Ignacio Espeleta, who was proud to be from Cádiz, building on the nationalistic pride of Lorca’s presentation. Lorca’s social dissatisfactions might have turned his artistic faculties to more ordinary issues like the impoverished Gypsies and might have influenced his dislike towards the conventions of the academy, but his observations are the result of intellectual analysis. His awareness of the disadvantages of the poor and his knowledge of politics are part of what allows Lorca to voice his criticism towards the exclusiveness of the artistic realm. His intellectual faculties are the tools that enable him to express his views. He draws from the vast well of academic resources to produce prose and verse that reflect the confidence of one who knows his craft. The force that drives Lorca’s passionate voice, then, is not\r\n<blockquote>…merely subjective impulse, irrationality, an introverted and esoteric imagination, the repudiation of tradition and discipline, or a recourse to primitivism. It implies, on the contrary, a perception of the potential universality of the human spirit; a responsibility to artistic truth; a use of the whole mind—including intelligence, imagination, emotion, and more—in the service of artistic creation; an imaginative activity which is not turned primarily inward, but which looks out on the broad world of nature and humanity. (Tuttle 53)</blockquote>\r\nLorca puts the best of his abilities to the service of a greater truth: creating awareness about the importance of a national identity that represents all the layers of its social composition. Making use of his intellectual capabilities and his knowledge of Spain’s cultural folklore, Lorca presents to us an exquisite study of the mystical soul of Spain and some of its most influential artistic figures.\r\n\r\nWhile Lorca is content to criticize the intellectualization of art in the academy, he nonetheless has given us his intellectual expression in his lecture “Play and Theory of the Duende.” Therefore, in an unconscious way, Lorca supports the very claim to intellectualization he seeks to refute. Lorca’s work represents its author’s intellectual breadth, exceptional rhetorical skills and deep awareness of Spanish cultural identity.', 'Lorca: Against Intellectualism', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '272-autosave', '', '', '2012-02-27 14:18:53', '2012-02-27 14:18:53', '', 272, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?p=414', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

I question, however, whether these clubs promote diversity in practice or actually lead to division between groups. My roommates and I recently attended a party at a local bar hosted by the Korean Student Association. Dates with members of the group were being auctioned to raise money to support local public schools. We are not members of the club, but Adam, our friend’s brother, was being auctioned as a representative of Columbia’s Student Council, and we went to watch and support him. Adam was the only non-Korean on the auction block. At least 75% of the audience was Korean; almost everyone else was just tagging along with friends. This scene is not unusual. The same organizations heralded as the foundation of campus diversity rarely attract a diverse group of members. Korean students join the Korean Student Association, Jewish students join campus Hillel, homosexuals join the Queer Alliance, and Republican voters join Columbia College Republicans. Our pride in having so many diverse groups fades when we realize that these groups are more homogeneous that we like to believe.\r\n\r\nRichard Rodriguez sees the same trend involving the homosexual population in San Francisco. In his essay “Late Victorians,” Rodriguez gives a personalized history of the gay community in California. He describes the attitude toward homosexuality in general, toward gay households and families, toward gay artists and interior designers, and the San Franciscan reaction to the AIDS epidemic. Rodriguez also understands and explains the cultural and socioeconomic boundaries that define the separate boroughs of San Francisco. He describes neighborhoods known as the “homosexual address in San Francisco” (126). Other neighborhoods are the “black and working-class parts of the city” (Rodriguez 122). Each neighborhood has its own identity and its inhabitants rarely have close connections with people from outside areas. Vivian Gornick sees the same division between ethnicities in New York City. In “On the street: nobody watches, everyone performs,” Gornick wanders through the city experiencing the rich variety of cultures. She recalls interactions with a writer on her block, two “tough old Jewish guys” on Greenwich Avenue, a black couple on Ninth Avenue, and many different kinds of people at various points along her journey (3). She is aware that individual “neighborhoods accumulate personalities” (18). She pins the fabulously wealthy to Park Avenue, the bourgeois to West End Avenue, and the remnants of bohemia to her area of Greenwich Village. Just like in San Francisco, New Yorkers stay within their neighborhoods and rarely venture out into relationships with people from other areas.\r\n\r\nHuman beings are by nature extremely xenophobic. People with a common trait or background tend to group together for support and comfort, and they rarely reach out to other groups. Each community is expected to take care of its own members. The Korean Student Association has its own parties for its members, and other clubs at Columbia have their own programs. Gornick seems to be the exception for her ability to blend in and involve herself with so many types of people. However, even she is shocked when she happens to spot “someone from [her] block…in another neighborhood and the first impulse of the brain is, What are you doing here?” (2) I had a similar reaction when I happened to see a classmate on my subway in the area outside Columbia campus. Both Gornick and I expressed our shock with surprised laughter and a friendly greeting before continuing on our way. Unfortunately, in other situations, this shock is more controversial and far less friendly.\r\n\r\nRodriguez experienced the transition of the San Franciscan homosexual community from a discreet lifestyle hidden in bars on Polk Street to a vibrant, flamboyant culture on Castro Street. As the population of gay men in California grew, the classic Victorian homes of the area were divided up into apartments for these non-traditional households. The growing population of homosexuals in San Francisco was not welcome in these areas. They were seen as “blockbusters” that were destroying “the discreet compromise” between the different neighborhoods of a “tolerant city” (Rodriguez 122, 126). As soon as a couple arrived and began to fix up their new home, the neighbors would express their shock at seeing gays outside their traditional neighborhood with an “anonymous reply…on the sidewalk out front: KILL FAGGOTS” (Rodriguez 123). This xenophobic response stems from common stereotypes and over-generalizations.\r\n\r\nRodriguez contends that “society’s condemnation forced the homosexual to find his redemption outside nature”—namely, fashion and interior decorating. Homosexual interior decorators are attempting to “make up” for their sexual orientation by performing a useful service for the greater community. This is a prime example of Federico García Lorca’s essay “Play and Theory of the Duende.” Duende—the passion that appears in great art—is discovered only after great struggle and conflict. Art produced with duende reveals “the culture, the sensitivity of a people who discover man’s best anger, bile, and weeping” (Lorca 58). The community of gay decorators, painters, dancers, and other artists described by Rodriguez has definitely seen the worst of human beings’ anger and negativity. Finding and using duende to produce art is like “crying tears of blood” (Lorca 61). This is easily applicable to the artistic homosexual population of San Francisco, whose members have to bear people who pity them—“they don’t seem real, poor darlings”—and dismiss them and their supporters as infantile “yuppies” (Rodriguez 127). At the same time, they have to deal with the terrors of the AIDS epidemic and the grief of losing their partners and friends to such a horrific death. All of this opposition has given the homosexual the duende needed to succeed in the art world. This impulse to “challenge the rule of nature” is actually a pure expression of duende (Rodriguez 124).\r\n\r\nDuende is not confined to interior decorating and visual art; “Duende is a power not a work” (Lorca 49). This power can be seen in the tremendous response of Californians to the AIDS crisis. The horrors of AIDS quickly spread throughout the entire city of San Francisco and enveloped the heterosexual as well as the homosexual community. In a united effort containing streaks of duende, the city came together to fight this evil. Rodriguez vividly defines the far-reaching effects of AIDS:\r\n<blockquote>[I]ts victims were as often black, Hispanic, straight. Neither were Charity and Mercy only white, only male, only gay. Others came. There were nurses and nuns and the couple from next door, co-workers, strangers, teenagers, corporations, pensioners. (133)</blockquote>\r\nThis type of communal duende appears whenever groups have each cried “tears of blood” and come together to fight a common evil (Lorca 61). Gornick relates several experiences that stand out for the deep connection formed between herself and inhabitants of different neighborhoods, both literal and figurative. One such example is the brief conversation she has with a “skinny, young, black” man in the middle of Times Square. A young boy had just committed suicide in front of them by lying down in the road in front of oncoming traffic. In emotional shock, Gornick turns to a member of the boy’s community for support and explanation. This brief bond between the two worlds sprang up as a direct result of a common tragedy. Later, Gornick recalls the night that her neighbor’s husband dies. Although they live in the same building, the two women never speak and appear to live in two different worlds. One night, Gornick sees the woman crying in the lobby in deep distress over the loss of her husband. In the face of such a crisis, the two very different women come together to support each other and to offer help and encouragement.\r\n\r\nThe Korean Student Association charity date auction showed duende on a smaller scale. Students from different groups all came together to raise money for public education. The current problems in the public school system affect everyone, and Columbia students rose above ethnic lines to support this worthy cause. In the face of a common enemy, divisions between clubs no longer mattered. My friends and I were welcome at the KSA party because it was supporting a mutual interest. Through our efforts to support public education, a community was formed that crossed cultural, religious, racial, and political boundaries. These new friendships, however brief, were filled with duende that will push the effects of our efforts higher than we could have hoped to achieve as individuals.\r\n\r\n“Where is the duende?” asks Lorca (62). It is in the pure sense of community responsibility that drives all different types of people to overcome their xenophobia and learn “to love what is corruptible” (Rodriguez 134). It is what connects the people walking with Gornick on the streets of New York and what pulls all the individual clubs at Columbia together to form a vivid diversity fair. It allows my roommates and me to feel accepted at the Korean Student Association’s charity auction. And it drives the homosexual community in San Francisco to find its niche in the artistic sphere in California. Each community still maintains its own individual identity and territory, but a mutual bond of tolerance is formed whenever different groups face a common obstacle and put aside their disagreements to work together to produce a solution filled with societal duende.', 'Societal Duende', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'societal-duende', '', '', '2012-03-23 15:41:35', '2012-03-23 15:41:35', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=274', 0, 'essay', '', 0);

Though historical analysis might reveal that the Second World War had its roots in what were the early stages of the Holocaust, that which made the war worthy of its worldly status did not truly begin until a number of years later. By the time the United States and its allies finally launched a full scale attack against the Fascist powers in 1944, most of the genocide that the Nazis ultimately committed had already taken place, and many of the death camps had long since closed down because there was simply no more killing to be done. What exactly was it, then, that took the world so long to respond? And if the international community was truly unaware of what was taking place (a theory which has long since been abandoned), why did the Europeans who were aware of but not subject to Nazi persecution sit back and watch?\r\n\r\nIn his speech “The Perils of Indifference,” Elie Wiesel addresses the question that underlies any discussion of the world’s response to the atrocities of the Holocaust: “What is indifference?” (2). Essentially, his question raises two separate but equally important issues: What motivates indifference, and what are its consequences? Martha C. Nussbaum and Bruce Robbins, in their respective essays “Compassion and Terror” and “The Sweatshop Sublime,” present the typical contemporary answers to these questions. It seems worthwhile, however, to take heed of the words of wisdom that Wiesel, a Holocaust survivor, might have to offer given his experience. Analyzing the prevailing approaches to these questions, from the perspective of two significantly different generations, ought to give deeper insight into the concept of indifference, how it might explain the global response to the Holocaust, and, perhaps more importantly, how it relates to the world today.\r\n\r\nNussbaum expresses, in part, the more modern view on the causes of indifference in her essay “Compassion and Terror.” Though she directly discusses the concept of compassion in the context of the events surrounding September 11th, her particular thoughts on the causes of this emotion are of equal relevance with regard to indifference. Commenting on why Americans did not respond emotionally to the plight of Rwandans with the same intensity as they did following September 11th, she writes, “suffering Rwandans could not be seen as part of the larger ‘us’ for whose fate we trembled” (17). Nussbaum is of the belief that, among other causal factors, a sense of connectivity and commonality is required between the victim and the onlooker for compassion to be aroused within the onlooker. If this sense is lacking, the result will be a relative lack of compassion, which is one important element of indifference.\r\n\r\nBruce Robbins, author of the essay “The Sweatshop Sublime,” would argue against Nussbaum’s point that a degree of closeness is required for any feeling of compassion to develop. Compassion, Robbins claims, can be aroused regardless of differences between the victim and the onlooker; it is simply the ability of compassion to affect action that is affected by the degree of closeness. One might experience a “moment of consciousness,” as Robbins describes it, in which one grasps the complexity of the division of labor and the inequality it engenders, but “this moment of consciousness will not be converted into action” (84). While compassion or pity can be felt for people no matter their nationality and social status, the crux of the issue is a different “tyranny of the close over the distant” (Robbins 86). The problem, ultimately, as Robbins explains, is “that global commitments can emerge more or less organically and continuously only from local, personal, familial commitments” (91). Though we may sympathize with the plight of others, our willingness to assist them will only be an outgrowth of more personal, tangible issues that we have committed ourselves to resolving. Thus, in Robbins’s terms it would seem indifference is not a lack of compassion, but rather a lack of action.\r\n\r\nThough these are two very distinct aspects of the definition of indifference, it is important to note that either of these elements could produce the same effect. A lack of compassion will never lead to action, and compassion without action is of no help to the sufferer. Despite their differences, Robbins and Nussbaum can at least agree on what causes indifference: a certain rift between the onlooker and the victim. A sense that the victim is different or distant ultimately leads to a lack of compassion (in Nussbaum’s definition) or a lack of action (in Robbins’ definition), both of which leave the victim helpless.\r\n\r\nWiesel, representing the approach to indifference of generations past that have learned from history and experience, could respond to this idea with several pieces of contradictory evidence. Most notably, how would the citizens of Poland and Germany who claimed to bear no hatred for the victims of Nazi persecution fit into this definition? Were these not their fellow citizens? Yet so many of them did not speak up or act and went on living their lives showing no signs of sympathy for the suffering of others in their midst. In the city of Lublin, Poland, people literally lived with a death camp in their backyard; if indifference can exist under such circumstances, then how can we define it as a product of distance? Of course Nussbaum might retort that perhaps these people did feel compassion, though they did not show it, and Robbins would say that the lack of action in this situation stemmed from a fear for their own lives. If this is true, then Wiesel would want to know what there is to say for the response of the United States, which presumably was not afraid of the Nazis. While the argument of distance and difference might apply, does it still hold in the case of the St. Louis, for instance? As Wiesel explains, the St. Louis was a ship that requested refuge in the U.S., among other countries, and “its human cargo—maybe 1,000 Jews—was turned back to Nazi Germany” (4). Given a blatant opportunity to prevent the suffering of one thousand people that were figuratively knocking at the country’s door, the U.S. government sent them back with full knowledge of where it was sending them. Distance was most definitely not an issue, and one might argue that difference is not a factor when one is in direct contact with the victim. Then, according to Robbins and Nussbaum, why was the U.S. government so obviously indifferent?\r\n\r\nOne might be inclined to say that this question is irrelevant to Robbins’s and Nussbaum’s definitions of indifference altogether. It seems they are explaining the causes of indifference on the individual level, while Wiesel seeks to understand its causes on the national level. Yet even Robbins and Nussbaum equate these two realms. Though they are both clearly analyzing personal responses to certain issues, they frame their analyses in the context of discussions that can only be understood on a national level. Nussbaum wants to know what factors caused the response, or lack thereof, of Americans to the genocide in Rwanda. This question, while relevant on the individual level, only bears significance in the context of the national; no one could realistically expect the individual to affect the situation in Rwanda, whereas the collection of every individual response into what becomes the national one may have an impact. The same holds true with regards to Robbins’s discussion of sweatshop labor. While it may be necessary to examine the causes of indifference on the individual level in order to fully understand the logic behind it, such an analysis is only important in that it leads to an understanding of the concept on a larger scale. Thus, the question that Wiesel poses about the U.S. government’s response to the pleas of the St. Louis passengers is unequivocally relevant to Robbins’s and Nussbaum’s understandings of indifference on the individual level as well.\r\n\r\nWiesel, in attempting to decipher the causes of indifference, asks, “Is it necessary at times to practice it simply to keep one’s sanity, live normally, enjoy a fine meal and a glass of wine, as the world around us experiences harrowing upheavals?” (2). Robbins, explaining the aftermath of the moment of consciousness of the division of labor, answers this question as directly as possible: “You have a cup of tea or coffee. You get dressed. Just as suddenly, just as shockingly, you are returned to yourself in all your everyday smallness” (85). The reason, according to Robbins, that compassion will not necessarily lead to action is because to worry about the division of labor that produced your shirt or cup of coffee means you will not be able to fully enjoy those things. Nussbaum agrees with this idea as well, commenting on our relative lack of compassion for things that do not affect us: “There are so many things closer to home to distract us, and these things are likely to be so much more thoroughly woven into our scheme of goals” (16). Essentially, Nussbaum is of the opinion that the capacities for concern we have for our own happiness and the happiness of others are mutually exclusive, and ultimately we have to choose one over the other. The fact that our personal goals are a more immediate distraction and a more integral aspect of our daily lives prevents us from feeling concern for the suffering of others to the degree that we can or should. The consensus here seems to be that, if nothing else, indifference is the result of a very natural desire to maintain one’s own happiness. This approach might help explain the response of the U.S. to the request of the St. Louis passengers: granting one group refuge might have inspired others to make a similar journey, thereby sparking an influx in immigration that would be easier for the government not to have to worry about or deal with. Indifference is a product of values that prioritize personal happiness over the greater good.\r\n\r\nHaving established the root cause of indifference, it seems appropriate to analyze its effects. Implicit within both Nussbaum’s and Robbins’s essays, in that they only discuss the causes of compassion and action, or lack thereof, is the widespread idea that lack of compassion and lack of action effectively leave the situation static and unchanged. According to Nussbaum, if we are not concerned for the fate of suffering Rwandans, then they will simply continue to suffer; according to Robbins, if we do not respond to the plight of sweatshop laborers, then their plight will remain. Wiesel, however, emphatically disputes this notion that indifference is merely neutral. He argues, “Indifference is always the friend of the enemy, for it benefits the aggressor- never his victim, whose pain is magnified when he or she feels forgotten” (3). The effect of indifference, in Wiesel’s view, is twofold: it aids the oppressor by giving him the necessary means and the confidence to continue what he is doing, and it worsens the victim’s suffering by diminishing his hope. The former effect is highlighted by the St. Louis incident in that the U.S. literally sent the Nazis one thousand more people to persecute and murder as a direct result of their indifference. This sheds light upon a very relevant distinction between the notion of lack of compassion and the notion of indifference: lack of compassion seems to imply neutrality as Robbins and Nussbaum would like to have it; something is missing, therefore no effect will be produced. Indifference, however, is an emotion in its own right; it is an inactively active response with real consequences that are rarely positive.\r\n\r\nThis important distinction captures within it a true understanding of the problem of indifference. It is not, as Nussbaum and Robbins seem to imply, a simple lack of compassion or action to complement compassion, both of which lead to the same result; rather, it is a helping hand to the oppressor. It is a truly active response. This being the case, it seems all the more necessary to directly deal with the issue by stopping it at the source. The driving force behind indifference is the one idea that Wiesel, Nussbaum, and Robbins all seem to be able to agree on: the need to ignore the plight of others in order to maintain one’s own happiness. But given the already proven results of indifference, is it feasible to say that the gain in happiness one receives from being indifferent outweighs the consequences? Is our ability to enjoy trivial pleasures to a slightly greater degree more important than the suffering and lives of so many?

Though historical analysis might reveal that the Second World War had its roots in what were the early stages of the Holocaust, that which made the war worthy of its worldly status did not truly begin until a number of years later. By the time the United States and its allies finally launched a full scale attack against the Fascist powers in 1944, most of the genocide that the Nazis ultimately committed had already taken place, and many of the death camps had long since closed down because there was simply no more killing to be done. What exactly was it, then, that took the world so long to respond? And if the international community was truly unaware of what was taking place (a theory which has long since been abandoned), why did the Europeans who were aware of but not subject to Nazi persecution sit back and watch?\r\n\r\nIn his speech “The Perils of Indifference,” Elie Wiesel addresses the question that underlies any discussion of the world’s response to the atrocities of the Holocaust: “What is indifference?” (2). Essentially, his question raises two separate but equally important issues: What motivates indifference, and what are its consequences? Martha C. Nussbaum and Bruce Robbins, in their respective essays “Compassion and Terror” and “The Sweatshop Sublime,” present the typical contemporary answers to these questions. It seems worthwhile, however, to take heed of the words of wisdom that Wiesel, a Holocaust survivor, might have to offer given his experience. Analyzing the prevailing approaches to these questions, from the perspective of two significantly different generations, ought to give deeper insight into the concept of indifference, how it might explain the global response to the Holocaust, and, perhaps more importantly, how it relates to the world today.\r\n\r\nNussbaum expresses, in part, the more modern view on the causes of indifference in her essay “Compassion and Terror.” Though she directly discusses the concept of compassion in the context of the events surrounding September 11th, her particular thoughts on the causes of this emotion are of equal relevance with regard to indifference. Commenting on why Americans did not respond emotionally to the plight of Rwandans with the same intensity as they did following September 11th, she writes, “suffering Rwandans could not be seen as part of the larger ‘us’ for whose fate we trembled” (17). Nussbaum is of the belief that, among other causal factors, a sense of connectivity and commonality is required between the victim and the onlooker for compassion to be aroused within the onlooker. If this sense is lacking, the result will be a relative lack of compassion, which is one important element of indifference.\r\n\r\nBruce Robbins, author of the essay “The Sweatshop Sublime,” would argue against Nussbaum’s point that a degree of closeness is required for any feeling of compassion to develop. Compassion, Robbins claims, can be aroused regardless of differences between the victim and the onlooker; it is simply the ability of compassion to affect action that is affected by the degree of closeness. One might experience a “moment of consciousness,” as Robbins describes it, in which one grasps the complexity of the division of labor and the inequality it engenders, but “this moment of consciousness will not be converted into action” (84). While compassion or pity can be felt for people no matter their nationality and social status, the crux of the issue is a different “tyranny of the close over the distant” (Robbins 86). The problem, ultimately, as Robbins explains, is “that global commitments can emerge more or less organically and continuously only from local, personal, familial commitments” (91). Though we may sympathize with the plight of others, our willingness to assist them will only be an outgrowth of more personal, tangible issues that we have committed ourselves to resolving. Thus, in Robbins’s terms it would seem indifference is not a lack of compassion, but rather a lack of action.\r\n\r\nThough these are two very distinct aspects of the definition of indifference, it is important to note that either of these elements could produce the same effect. A lack of compassion will never lead to action, and compassion without action is of no help to the sufferer. Despite their differences, Robbins and Nussbaum can at least agree on what causes indifference: a certain rift between the onlooker and the victim. A sense that the victim is different or distant ultimately leads to a lack of compassion (in Nussbaum’s definition) or a lack of action (in Robbins’ definition), both of which leave the victim helpless.\r\n\r\nWiesel, representing the approach to indifference of generations past that have learned from history and experience, could respond to this idea with several pieces of contradictory evidence. Most notably, how would the citizens of Poland and Germany who claimed to bear no hatred for the victims of Nazi persecution fit into this definition? Were these not their fellow citizens? Yet so many of them did not speak up or act and went on living their lives showing no signs of sympathy for the suffering of others in their midst.

Sometimes I think us engineers in the School of Engineering and Applied Science deserve it. Once, when a friend casually remarked, “It seems like graduation is light-years away,” I absentmindedly responded, “Light-years measures distance, not time.” She then immediately threw that “SEAS kid” line at me. Another time, when a large group of my Columbia College friends were discussing their Literature Humanities class and were debating about certain philosophers and their beliefs, someone asked me what I thought. I winced, painfully admitting that I did not know a single one of Aristotle’s philosophies. The “SEAS kid” line was hurled again. On late Sunday nights, when a lot of us physics students are working on our long weekly physics problem sets together in our floor lounge, engaging in loud heated debates over topics such as rotational inertia or projectile motion with drag forces, at least a couple of non-engineering students will walk by the door, stick their heads in, and say things like, “You crazy SEAS kids,” or, “Engineers. Ha!” Perhaps engineers really do think, process information, and carry out tasks in a distinctive way. And perhaps these engineer-like tendencies carry over and unravel themselves when we attempt other supposedly nonscientific activities as well, writing being one of them.\r\n\r\nBefore writing anything for University Writing, the lens essay, the conversation paper, the research paper, or even this retrospective essay on my own writing, I would become extremely agitated. As soon as I sat down in front of my laptop, I began squirming in my chair as a multitude of uncomfortable questions popped up. There’s a paper due in 12 hours; what do I do? Do I even know anything about this topic? Wait, why am I writing about this subject? Should I change the topic instead? I need a food break! To me, writing a paper is like dismembering a ticking time bomb. I can feel the number of hours and minutes left before the deadline decline in an inverse relation to my exponentially rising frustration.\r\n\r\nIn order to ease my anxiety, I consoled myself with the fact that writing can be like science, and thankfully, science is not one of those entirely relative disciplines without concrete answers. Since I always feel like each step in writing any paper is governed by a consistent process, I joyfully discovered that the background procedure to writing a paper can be directly related to and governed by the steps of the scientific method. Yet while this discovery helped steady my pulse and slow my erratic breathing because I am comfortable with the steps of the scientific method, the writing counterparts of these steps were not so painless and were a very trying process this semester, to say the least:\r\n\r\n1. <em>Identify the problem or question. </em>This is the brainstorming process for the topic of the essay. It also involves choosing which sources to use to best back up the central argument. This is the easiest and most obvious step of the scientific method with respect to science, since usually someone uses the step process after he or she has recognized that there is a problem to be solved. Because this step in science is self-explanatory, I thought this step in writing would be similar. However, I have learned, in a long brutal way, that if you do not spend sufficient time on this initial step in the writing process, as easy as it may sound, you will pay for it after the first draft is complete. This is exactly what happened to me in the first two essays. I realized that even if someone has a general topic in mind, the first draft may still turn out rather catastrophically if the topic is not planned out well or is not detailed enough.\r\n\r\nIn the first essay, in which we were supposed to use a concept from one of the class readings as a “lens” on a subject of my own choosing, I almost disregarded this step. I thought, “Okay, I’m obviously going to write about Vivian Gornick’s essay ‘On the Street: Nobody Watches, Everyone Performs’ and her notion of street theater.” Little did I know that simply defining an author and a vague concept as a topic provides a setup for a rather horrific, confusing first draft. I then faced the mental anguish of writing many more drafts than necessary because I did not spend enough time on this first step. After the first draft was done, I realized that I had many problems in connecting separate experiences into one flowing essay while incorporating Gornick’s ideas and language. Then I separated the experiences into geographic location and wrote the entire essay explaining the differences in location with application to street theater. In the middle, I had problems defining street theater in terms of kinds of performances, and then after I wrote a last sentence about masks, I decided to make the entire essay about two different kinds of masks. I finally changed the topic into masked and unmasked performances in the last draft, feeling extremely queasy from all the unneeded mental exertion. Had I planned out and spent more time identifying and narrowing down the topic in the beginning, I would not have written so much unnecessary and ultimately deleted material, and would not have had to deal with such a messy array of random topics and ideas.\r\n\r\nSince I am accustomed to taking the first “identify the problem” step for granted in science, I sadly made the same mistake again with the conversation essay. It had even bigger, messier consequences. I jumped right into the essay without much background planning and ended up writing, once again, many unnecessary pages of drafts. In my first draft, I tried to compare the arguments in Jonathan Lethem’s essay “Speak, Hoyt-Schermerhorn” with Jonathan Franzen’s “Sifting the Ashes,” but afterwards I realized the essay was too loosely connected. I had intended to write about both the personal and documentary-based histories of the two essays, but I did not do enough planning to realize ahead of time that the two essays would be quite impractical to use together. Therefore, I started over completely from scratch, this time using the Lethem essay and Jamaica Kincaid’s “In History.” I quoted too heavily from Kincaid the first time and struggled to incorporate Lethem’s ideas, because, yet again, I did not plan well.\r\n\r\nI must say I have learned my lesson, because the punishment of extra writing is really quite harsh for a SEAS kid. Overall, I realized how important this planning process is, not only for the sake of time but also for the quality of the paper. I did not fall into the same trap the third time around in my final research paper, thankfully. This often-overlooked initial step of science is instead crucial to writing.\r\n\r\n2. <em>Form a hypothesis.</em> In writing, this includes the entire process of thinking through all the ways of proving the topic that was decided on in step one and putting it down on paper in a first draft. In this step, I noticed a trend in my writing: since engineers tend to be more mechanical, even my attempts to be creative ended up in a structured, process-oriented way. I realized I started each essay the same way with a personal anecdote, always starting with “I”: in my lens essay, “I made my way along the street” (“Mask of Performance” 1), and in the research essay, “I [remembered] riding in a horse carriage” (“Passion for Experimentation” 1). Although I always try to muster up creativity to place into these anecdotes, it is amusing to see how even my creativity is restricted to a formula in my papers.\r\n\r\nWithin this second step also lie mechanics and grammar, which are certainly needed as the draft is being created after the brainstorming. Syntax, mechanics, and grammar are all vital aspects of writing but usually are not an engineer’s forte. Like laws and theories in science, I know language and all of its aspects are extremely important in writing; yet in the first couple essays, I consistently brushed over these aspects, and my essay was much lower in quality than it could have been. I actually handed in a final draft of my lens essay that contained mistakes such as writing “an” instead of “and,” due to a lack of proofreading. Since then, I have resolved to spend more time on the technical aspects of writing, and hopefully these careless errors will not appear again.\r\n\r\n3.<em> Test your hypothesis with experiments. </em>The writing analogs to these experiments are the many drafts of revision. Within the drafts and revisions, aspects of writing such as structure and organization are important before the final draft. In this step, I noticed another engineer-like aspect of my writing: I like to prove things. I like to follow up statements with supporting material, and I like everything to be backed by evidence. For example, in the research essay, I wrote, “Some proponents of animal rights argue that those supporting animal experimentation have put human rights too high and have complete disregard for the well-being of animals,” but I feel comfortable and justified in dismissing this statement in my essay because there is not “much substantial evidence” to support it (“Passion for Experimentation” 8). I then went on to show how evidence pointed in the opposite way.\r\n\r\nWhereas a need to support each statement in an essay is a positive factor that arises from engineer tendencies, a less positive aspect that falls under this third step in writing is a lack of aesthetic tendencies. When drafting, I think of improving the structure of my essays and the format of the argument. I like my essays to be straightforward and to the point, but the aesthetics of writing do not tend to weigh heavily in my mind. I am inclined to make blunt statements such as “Concern and responsibility for human beings has helped push medical innovations to the cutting edge with the help of animal testing” (“Passion for Experimentation” 4). While I used to think this direct approach was not “good,” I realized that there are many approaches to writing, and it is not bad to prefer a straightforward approach to a florid one.\r\n\r\n4. <em>Form a conclusion</em>. This is perhaps the sweetest writing step. It marks the completion of the final draft in writing. All the many hours of frustration, stress, and mental anguish have finally converted themselves into words on paper. In science, it denotes a grand conclusion to the guesswork. In both subjects, the last step warrants a ten-decibel yelp of satisfaction and, certainly, relief.\r\n\r\nMany humanities courses make engineers shudder, and at the beginning of the semester, for me, writing was one of them. However, looking back, it was not so scary. Sure, the assignments were plentiful, the essays were long, and I lost a lot of sleep in between, but in the end, I really feel transformed into a better writer, even though I am sure that when I finish this last University Writing paper and go dancing around in the hallways announcing the end of my colossal feat, some humanities student will say, “She’s such a SEAS kid.

It is where performers coax precious pieces of their own sentiments to fit the shape of their art and present the finished product for all to appreciate, judge, or criticize. Musicians, actors, and dancers gamble their skills against time, betting that the quality of their presentation can keep up with the passage of every irreversible second and praying to be fortunate while they walk the line separating expression from exposure. Having invested half my lifetime of eighteen years into violin performance, I know music to be a source of solace, thrill, and embarrassment. If all goes well, performance is exhilarating. If mishaps occur, performance is merciless because anything that goes down cannot be taken back. Time cannot be manipulated.\r\n\r\nIn her essay “Forty-One False Starts,” when writing about the random and spontaneous nature of the artwork created by modern painter David Salle, Janet Malcolm draws a comparison between Salle’s art and the process of performance. She writes, “Every brushstroke is irrevocable. He doesn’t correct or repaint, ever. He works under the dire conditions of performance. Everything counts, nothing may be taken back, everything must always go relentlessly forward, and a mistake may be fatal” (507). The first thought this passage evoked in my mind concerned the undeniable what’s-done-is-done nature of performance. The second questioned why anyone would subject an art where erasers, new sheets of canvas, and repainting exist to the conditions of an art where each stroke is forever lost in time. I’d had enough experience in performance to believe that modern visual artists’ playing peek-a-boo with their blessed second chances was a stupid, ungrateful game.\r\n\r\nIf I rewind my memory back to the audition for my first major violin competition, playback begins with my ascent onto stage from behind heavy black curtains of dusty velvet. A hardwood stage floor illuminated in yellow light resonates pointedly upon each step of my high-heeled feet, and shadowed mezzanine seats stretch far into corners where light won’t reach them. There are three people sitting somewhere in the audience—three judges who will determine whether my performance is the best, the one worthy of a solo concerto concert and a good sum of money.\r\n\r\nAs I played that day, I created a rendition of Edouard Lalo’s Symphonie Espagnole that hit the notes and brought out the colors of desperado, gypsy fervor. It was beautiful and the music engulfed me entirely, but in my enthusiasm I neglected to check my own power. I sliced a three-string chord near the end of the piece with the passion it deserved—too much—and heard the discordant bang of broken violin strings as the bridge on my instrument snapped in half, killing the music right then and there. The silence that followed stunned me and my listeners as a disturbance that could not be forgiven. Needless to say, I did not win the competition. It had been a fatal mistake.\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to reconcile myself with David Salle’s desire to embrace this dangerous spontaneity of performance, I tried to imagine what my performance would have looked like if it had been in the form of a painting. I pictured fat brush strokes of colorful oil paint, in the center depicting a lovely gypsy woman dancing to Lalo’s Spanish music, caught in the picture mid-spin with her brilliant red dress twirling about her legs. Swirls of bright colors would surround her, the way the music engulfed me that day. She would be wearing noisy heels on a hardwood stage floor, and she would be dancing her heart out. Of course there would also be a gash of black paint splattered diagonally across the painting’s focal point, to symbolize that fatal chord. The gash would stick out like a sore thumb, confusing and upsetting viewers of the artwork; they would wonder in hesitant horror why the beauty of the painting had to be defaced by such a ghastly-looking mistake.\r\n\r\nThese are exactly the emotions David Salle’s art evokes. His paintings consist of broken, obscene images that don’t seem to belong together—“like an ugly mood,” according to Malcolm (505). He borrows images from previous artwork, takes nudity to the level of disturbance, and combines these items in an unnatural amalgamation. Malcolm, in describing her impression of his work, says “It was an abstracted sensation of dislocation, yearning, and loss that started resonating with my sense of what both art and life are like here in the late twentieth century. Suddenly Salle’s harsh artifice seemed heroic, an earnest of authenticity—without ceasing to seem perverse, against the grain” (517). His crude, jarring pictures communicate to their observers the same emotions as those of their creator. They capture the passion of the artist interminably, preserving the moments of mishap and admitting the realness of imperfection and awkwardness.\r\n\r\nAlthough the artist seems to imitate performance, I do not believe he actually strives to replicate it. The precarious nature of performance is only a lens into the fragility of something much more universal. Mistakes made in life and mistakes made in performance are analogously irrevocable. In imitation of this perception, Malcolm’s writing is organized into forty-one versions of a potential introductory passage. The scope of the entire work never goes beyond introduction; instead, forty-one separate attempts encompass a general conception of both Salle the artist and Salle the man. The concluding “false start,” as her title calls them, quotes Salle saying, “Have you ever thought that your real life hasn’t begun yet?” (530). If Malcolm’s discontinued false starts also subscribe to this yet-to-begin approach to life, the analogy she makes between her writing and her subject’s painting also comes to embrace Salle’s hopelessly expectant outlook. It is an attitude that is at once depressing and appealing; the success of Salle’s art professes to Malcolm’s observation that the coarseness of his art is the authenticity that makes it beautiful.\r\n\r\nThe unconventional form of Malcolm’s writing is, quite poetically, an illustration of three things at once: David Salle’s art, his approach to life, and the beauty of false starts in every sense of the phrase. I have taken Malcolm’s realization and used it as a model to understand my love for performance. If beauty in art and beauty in life can be linked via the espousal of mistakes, performance has one up on visual art. Though Salle never erases or repaints, he does exercise another option that visual artists have which is unavailable to performers—the option to destroy. Malcolm describes one painting of Salle’s that he botched: it depicted two ballet dancers. Once he deemed it a failure, Salle decided to obliterate the image in gray paint. “It’s a reject, a failed painting. It’s going to be cut up,” the artist said of the painting (513). Admitting how wonderful something was only accentuates the frustration with the mistake that killed it. The knowledge of what could have been is what drives a person to regret. In my life, neither that killer chord nor my memory of it is destructible, depriving me of the visual artist’s use of destruction as a means for denial, and his use of denial as a comforting pretense that conceals what happened.\r\n\r\nWithout the security of destruction, performance nurtures a rebellious kind of motivation. After I recovered from the stinging silence that followed that fatal chord, I took a dazed bow and heel-clicked my way back off stage, all the while biting down cries of astonishment and despair. At home a couple of days later, I found camaraderie in the experience of my favorite celebrity performer. I stared at the television, mouth agape, as figure skater Michelle Kwan took a fall in the 1998 Winter Olympics that cost her the Gold Medal and landed her in second place instead. However, as much as Kwan’s memory of that fall had to have served as a torturing reminder of the medal she could have deserved, it also had to play a part in her determination to keep trying. In the end, Michelle Kwan was the only skater of the three Olympic medalists that year who continued competitive skating.\r\n\r\nFollowing the tragedy of my first competition I went on to play in, and win, two others with the same piece. But even success will not erase failures in performance; they remain indestructible, preserved in memory. Here is where the connection that Malcolm delineates between art, performance, and life brings to the table a need to appreciate the imperfect. Beauty in art, performance, and life is the congregation of many parts of a whole, a series of imperfections that complement each other in the big picture. In this way, I realized that the fatal quality of performance actually translates into an economy by which mistakes raise the value of success. It is incredible how empowering the experience of a successful performance is. The immortality of mistakes is a threat intimidating enough to render each success absolutely priceless; the danger provides the thrill. Life is of the same economy. Mistakes make us human at the same time that they make us invincible, because they provide the motivation and inspiration to continue living. Such is a truth in the life of the artist, the performer, and the human being.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'A Fatal Mistake', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'a-fatal-mistake', '', '', '2012-04-10 15:44:07', '2012-04-10 15:44:07', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=278', 0, 'essay', '', 0);

I brought you here to tell me what is wrong but I have been the one doing the talking while you have remained silent for the last twenty minutes; speak to me, sweetheart.” My teacher was right. It was not normal for a ten-year-old to be reading<em> The Arabian Nights</em> while his classmates were playing soccer. What she did not know was that answering her question was going to take longer than twenty minutes. In fact, I am still figuring it out today. Maybe she did not expect me to figure it out; probably she just wanted me to speak up, to say a word or two at that moment. Probably she did not even want me to speak; crying would have done it. I could not. I could not speak out or cry. I could not express my emotions, my feelings, openly and freely. There were certainly more things I was not capable of doing. New in town and at school, I did not know what to make of my new classmates’ jokes about my socks. I did not know how to handle being away from my overprotective single mom for the first time. I did not like living with my uncle’s family; I could not help but hate my oldest cousin when she stole the gummy bears my mom sent me from so far away. But I could not speak up for myself. It was hard for me to express what I was going through, to simply say, “I am angry,” “I am lonely,” “I miss mom.”\r\n\r\nGeorge Orwell’s essay “Why I Write” is a compelling retrospective in which the author, probably one of the most famous British novelists and essayists of the 20th century, expresses the reasons that motivated him to become a writer. As I read the opening lines, in which he describes how he felt undervalued and unpopular at school, I found interesting resemblances between his childhood and mine. What I find especially interesting is his assertion that there is an “emotional attitude” that fuels the pen of every writer before he or she becomes one. Orwell describes four characteristics that define this emotional attitude: sheer egoism, aesthetic enthusiasm, historical impulse, and political purpose. He also says that the time in which a writer lives will also dictate what he or she writes about, and concludes his essay by establishing that his most meaningful works have been those that carried the political commitment of the time he lived in. As I decide whether or not I have what it takes to be a writer myself, I reflect on the emotional attitude that makes me write and the kinds of writing I look forward to reading. In particular, I wonder if that emotional attitude Orwell describes may affect our need to engage ourselves politically to the times we live in, the reality around us, and how that emotional attitude can also shape how we write and want to read about that age in which we are immersed. In my case, like Orwell’s, that emotional attitude is closely related to my childhood and the best means of expression at my disposal I had at that time: love letters.\r\n\r\nMany of us who decide to devote our lives to political causes like to believe that we do it for the sake of helping others. Sometimes, however, much of what we do or write stems from unresolved personal issues related to our emotional attitudes. I like recognition, I strive for aesthetic beauty in writing and whoever bore the burden of reading my essays for University Writing this semester will know the pervading theme was political and historical. However, I struggle to fit myself exclusively into any of these categories. Writing, to me, is more of a necessity than a tool, a necessity to communicate, to speak up or act the way I could not when I was questioned by Teacher Margarita—a need to be heard.\r\n\r\nI write because I am in constant need of finding somebody who can read what I write and identify with it, who can make my words his or hers. I want them to be with me now, at the time that I am writing, and thus also at that time when I was ten years old and I did not know how to express my emotions. I want them to let me know that I was not alone before and that I am not alone now when I remember. I need them to let me know that they are with me, for they lived the same things and felt the same way; they cried under their pillows for the same reasons that I cried under mine, however unjustified, however vain, however human. Unlike Orwell’s “sheer egoism” my need to write does not strive from my eagerness to be unique and special, but from my need to feel normal, to feel like everybody else.\r\n\r\nMy first meaningful experience with writing came with love letters. When I started searching for reasons to become a writer my old high school love letters seemed so distant and superficial in comparison with more politically committed initiatives that going back to them seemed vain. However, the more I have been looking into politically committed writing enterprises the more I realize that my current essays and my old love letters share a fundamental motivation.\r\n\r\nWhen I look back at the essays I wrote this semester I see that this need to belong resides, in some essays more than others, at the core of the emotional attitude that motivated me to write them. In addressing the issue of discrimination against illegal immigrants in America I used my personal experience when I came to America from Latin America as a lens to describe the uneasiness that many immigrants feel when they come to a new world. As a matter of fact, I explicitly wrote that when I stopped living at home and came to the first world trying desperately to feel special and sophisticated, “I entered a new world where I longed to be the same as everybody else.” As I write these lines, I become aware that the circumstances surrounding me during the time when <em>The Arabian Nights</em>was my best friend resemble the circumstances in which I found myself when I arrived in America when I was older: those being a completely new environment and a need to integrate with the rest of the people. This finding actually makes me wonder whether I subconsciously put myself in the position of immigrating to a new world, as I never resolved the internal conflicts that moving from one place to another created in me during my childhood.\r\n\r\nAs later course assignments restrained our possibilities, my personal voice was less conspicuous but my need to belong still present. In my research essay I addressed again the issue of discrimination towards illegal immigrants, this time from the conceptual perspective of deconstruction. Despite the fact that the approach was different, the tone of my essay did not change from my first one. Even though my original concern was to unveil the racist nature of a selection of anti-immigrant discourses, the main claim of my conclusion was actually a cry to help illegal immigrants to integrate with the rest of the American population. I argued that discriminating against illegal immigrants and impeding the legalization of their status does not help the process of their assimilation into our culture. Even though discrimination against immigrants is a real problem, and my concern was genuine, I might have been unconsciously projecting my own need to integrate into American culture on all illegal immigrants.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, unlike Orwell, the pieces of writing that inspire me to become a writer now do not come from my intention to change the lives of others. Looking deeper into my emotional attitude toward writing, I see that my need to belong may be understood as a manifestation of a far more desperate cry: a need to feel loved and a difficulty in expressing affection. During my early years of adolescence, whenever I fell in love with a girl, I was not even able to see her face to face, let alone talk to her. Writing was the only means through which I felt confident approaching her. I started writing my first love letters when I was nine years old. I was successful when it came to expressing my feelings with metaphors and far-fetched analogies. My peers started to respect me a little and asked me to write love letters for them; my Literature teacher even called me the poet of the class. They all seemed to like my love letters, except for the girls to whom I wrote the letters. The muses that inspired my words did not want to share the same tables with me during school lunches. For them, the thought that somebody they barely exchanged words with had irremediably fallen in love with them to the degree that my letters attested was not a tribute to their beauty or my devotion to their beings, but an act of sheer freakiness.\r\n\r\nAnd they were probably right. In the same way that I was projecting my need to belong with illegal immigrants, I was probably projecting on these girls with whom I fell in love a need to be acknowledged and desired. This is probably one of the reasons why my love letters were full of passages with details about their eyes, their hair, or the way their mere names gave meaning to my life. I was actually begging loudly to be noticed myself. My words could be seen now as a trap in which I expected others, especially those girls, to notice me, my needs, and my feelings, through the seductive praising of their own qualities.\r\n\r\nLove letters have a special meaning for me as a person and as a writer, even if they never worked for me. That is because they never worked until I received one myself. When I was 18 years old I received a love letter from a girl I did not know. She signed the letter with her name, Adriana, confessing that she was in love with me. As I opened it and read through all fifteen lines that someone I had never seen before had carefully written for me, I was enthralled. I felt for the first time that my ability to express my emotions did not matter anymore. Her words were sweet, her tone sincere; she even had a beautiful spelling mistake on line fourteen. I loved the fact that even though the letter lacked any contact information, she had completely exposed herself. She had made a statement. Adriana had perpetuated a feeling she could not take back. I, on the other side, was completely shielded. It did not matter if I took twenty minutes to react to her words after reading them. Everything that was important would reveal itself naturally. All I had to do was to choose a comfortable and quiet place and listen to her. Nothing could be wrong. She loved me. For all I knew, nobody deserved my heart more than she did. No more acts or fears; I could just reread her letter over again. As a matter of fact, I did. I read her letter for days, over and over again. I read her words with delight for I knew they confirmed that I was not the only person unable to confront somebody important to me in person.\r\n\r\nAdriana never wrote to me again. Was it a mistake? Did she mean to give that letter to somebody else? I tried by all means to find out who she was but nobody I knew had heard of her. I spent much of my school time looking for her. Perhaps I still am. Whenever I read a book or an essay I am looking for clues to that love letter, for hints of those words that are carefully, if even mistakenly, written just for me. I look for the confirmation in somebody else’s life, fictitious or real, that I have not been alone. I look for a writer who, like Adriana, is able to unknowingly make me feel that I am not the only person unable to express my emotions and frustrations fluently at all times.\r\n\r\nUnlike Orwell, many of us do not have an innate facility for confronting difficult realities. Our skills to express our feelings, especially in speech, are one of those realities that writing negotiates. Hence, writing presents itself to us as an opportunity to step back, take a breath, and express our emotions. Sometimes we are unable to better communicate our feelings through writing and we end up concealing our emotions to others and to ourselves, even more than our speech would. Sometimes, writing does serve as an instrument to bring those emotions to the surface, and we do it in such an expressive way that our words transcend our experience; we are able to involuntarily elaborate little love letters that other people are waiting to open up and read.\r\n\r\nNot everyone likes love letters; some people actually hate having to write them, even to people they love. However, for those of us who do like them, every time we go to the bookstore and pick up a book we do not know much about, we close our eyes and hope that within those two hundred pages there will be clues to a message coming from somebody we do not know and whose emotional attitude we cannot even suspect. An anonymous human being who has carefully crafted a message directed to us and the experiences we have lived.

(280, 5, '2011-12-19 07:55:00', '2011-12-19 07:55:00', 'David Cronenberg began his career by making B horror films but later transcended the genre, creating gruesome, highly physical melodramas. One of the ways he has made this transition so smoothly is through the motif of sadomasochism, in which violence is directed at an objectified female. In watching Cronenberg films like <em>Videodrome, Crash, Dead Ringers, and A History of Violence</em>, it is easy to interpret one’s horror as an indication of the director’s offensive ideology. But one must also consider the possibility of a director distancing himself from his dramatic material through the use of horror techniques, and encouraging the viewer to do the same: a possibility that becomes clear through an investigation of the work of Laura Mulvey, one of film theory’s most prominent feminists.\r\n\r\nIn her essay, <em>Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema</em>, Mulvey discusses the cinematic convention of the objectified female and the man as the bearer of the look. She proposes that since the male protagonist directs the gaze of the spectator through subjective narration, mainstream Hollywood encourages the audience to identify with his voyeurism. She also claims that implicit in the voyeur-exhibitionist relationship between the male protagonist and the female lead is a sadomasochistic fantasy that is never explicitly realized: “The power to subject another person to the will sadistically or to the gaze voyeuristically is turned on to the woman as the object of both” (845). Because the Hollywood female lead is placed in a submissive role, film has not only reflected the sexism in society but also perpetuated it, affirming women’s submissive role in society. She identifies this problem through the use of Hitchcock films as an emblem of mainstream Hollywood misogyny, and she defines sadomasochism as the use of pain to enhance sexual pleasure in both the inflictor and the recipient.\r\n\r\nMulvey calls for a new subversive film language to destroy these misogynist pleasures of spectatorship by provoking the viewer to analyze the look of the camera. She writes, “The first blow against the monolithic accumulation of traditional film conventions (already undertaken by radical filmmakers) is to free the look of the camera into its materiality in time and space” (847). In other words, subversive filmmakers would need to eliminate the technique commonly referred to in film editing as the “eyeline match,” in which a character’s gaze is intercut with the subject of the gaze. This would free the look of the camera from the subjective look of the protagonist, and thereby heighten the audience’s awareness of the camera’s presence within the diegesis. Awareness enables analysis, which is the key to the destruction of pleasure. As Mulvey herself puts it: “analyzing pleasure, or beauty destroys it” (839), and “destruction of pleasure is a radical weapon” (838). Voyeurism, defined as the pleasurable illusion of looking in on a private world, would thus be destroyed through analysis.\r\n\r\nDavid Cronenberg achieves this same feat of destruction through slightly different means. He does not eliminate the eyeline match, nor does he avoid subjective narration. Whereas Mulvey talks about freeing “the look of the camera into its materiality,” Cronenberg frees the look of the male protagonist into its physical manifestations through the depiction of sadomasochism between the male protagonist and the female lead. Since Mulvey herself admits that the look of the spectator and the look of the male protagonist are intricately intertwined in the conventional narrative system to which Cronenberg adheres, Cronenberg’s subversion of Hollywood misogyny is in fact quite similar to Mulvey’s. Cronenberg’s films do provoke analysis of the nature of voyeuristic pleasure, as Mulvey urges, and this analysis has already had a destructive impact on that pleasure. There is then a possibility that Mulvey fails to acknowledge in her essay, namely that filmmakers can subvert the very techniques they use—that they can express ambivalence toward their own artistic tradition.\r\n\r\nBoth Mulvey and Cronenberg seem to feel that materiality or physicality makes film-going a more candid act. Cronenberg’s film Crash, from 1996, depicts a scenario in which a growing cult seeks sexual gratification through vehicular accidents. The male protagonist, a TV director, stumbles upon this subculture while trying to rejuvenate his sex life with his wife. In his article regarding that film, entitled, “A Vision of Masochism in the Affective Pain of Crash,” Anthony McCosker writes, “<em>Crash</em> explores new ways of corporealizing sexuality, bringing sexuality back to bodily experience” (43). Feminist film theorist Mary Ann Doane would not find this surprising: “It is precisely because the [female] body has been a major site of oppression that perhaps it must be the site of the battle to be waged” (384). If this is true, we can confidently say that Cronenberg heads straight for the battleground. But has he stumbled upon this battleground by chance? Or does his work have some purpose, some sociopolitical impact beyond entertainment?\r\n\r\nIn the film <em>Videodrome</em>, a new type of pornographic broadcast is discovered emanating from Pittsburgh in which people are beaten, tortured, and electrocuted in a bare room with clay walls. The broadcast is known as videodrome, and it catches the attention of protagonist Max Ren, who seeks to introduce it onto his channel, and his love interest Nikki, who wants to star on the show. Professor Brian Oblivion, a character in the film, claims, “The battle for the mind of North America will be fought in the video arena: the videodrome.” Since that is the title of the film itself, we can infer that Cronenberg realizes he is engaged in a battle “for the mind,” despite his perverse focus on the body. He clearly intends to fight, so which side is he fighting for: the pleasures of patriarchal society, or the destruction of those pleasures?\r\n\r\nBefore we can say for sure, it is necessary to compare Cronenberg’s films to Mulvey’s analyses films by Alfred Hitchcock. Mulvey examines Hitchcock’s films <em>Vertigo, Rear Window</em>, and <em>Marnie</em> through the lens of Freudian theory in order to demonstrate mainstream Hollywood misogyny as expressed through voyeuristic sadomasochism. By making this sadomasochism obvious to the viewer unschooled in Freud, Cronenberg enables more viewers to reach the same conclusions as Mulvey.\r\n\r\nFor example, in Hitchcock’s<em> Rear Window</em>, a crippled photojournalist spies on his neighbors from his apartment window and becomes convinced that the man across the courtyard has murdered his wife. The male protagonist’s voyeuristic tendencies are established by the fact that he is a photographer. The female lead’s exhibitionism is established by her obsessive interest in dress and style. The male protagonist comments on her expensive dress, but only to mock its excess. In <em>Videodrome</em>, the male protagonist practically psychoanalyzes the female lead’s dress, saying, “That dress. It’s very stimulating. It’s red. I mean, you know what Freud would have said about that dress.” The female lead replies, “And he would have been right.” Whereas the voyeur/exhibitionist relationship in Hitchcock relies on Mulvey’s psychoanalysis to be discerned by the typical viewer, Cronenberg does the psychoanalysis for us.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, while Mulvey interprets the motivation behind the male protagonist’s sadomasochistic desires as the female’s embodiment of the male’s “castration threat,” Cronenberg depicts that threat literally (Mulvey 837). In fact, the female lead in<em>Videodrome</em>, indirectly through her alliance with videodrome, causes the male protagonist to literally and physically grow a vagina that also functions somewhat like a VCR. There’s no need for Freud—the castration threat has been made real (see Fig.1):\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_320" align="alignright" width="720" caption="Figure 1"]<img class="size-full wp-image-320 " title="Figure 1" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image001.gif" alt="Figure 1" width="720" height="405" />[/caption]\r\n\r\nThe implicit sadomasochism that Mulvey discerns in this type of relationship is also made plain to the viewer. Mulvey writes of the female lead of Hitchcock’s <em>Vertigo</em>, “Her exhibitionism, her masochism, make her an ideal passive counterpart to Scottie’s [the male protagonist] active sadistic voyeurism” (846). Yet spectators who have not read Freud might not be able to discern the misogynist message of this sadomasochism because it is not enacted literally and materially. In <em>Videodrome</em>, the male protagonist watches the female lead on a television screen, making the voyeuristic nature of the relationship material. He then proceeds to whip the television screen with her image on it, making the sadomasochistic nature of the relationship material. The scene suggests that, like the male protagonist who directs our gaze, we are in some way violating the female lead by watching her voyeuristically on a screen. In the image below, taken from<em>Videodrome</em>, the male protagonist kisses a voyeuristically objectified image of the female lead (see Figure 2).\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_319" align="alignright" width="515" caption="Figure 2"]<img class="size-full wp-image-319 " title="Figure 2" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image004.gif" alt="Figure 2" width="515" height="371" />[/caption]\r\n\r\nTania Modleski writes in her essay, “The Women Who Knew Too Much: Hitchcock and Feminist Theory”:\r\n<blockquote>In Hitchcock’s films, women’s purses (and their jewelry) take on a vulgar Freudian significance relating to female sexuality and to men’s attempts to investigate it. One might think, for example, of the purse in the opening closeup shot of Marnie that contains Marnie’s ‘identity’ cards and the booty of her theft from patriarchy. (854)</blockquote>\r\nThe average spectator, however, would probably see merely a purse—not, as Modleski supposes, a guilty vagina. Hitchcock’s films generally served as mainstream genre pictures, and most viewers probably wanted to be entertained more than they wanted to crack the Freudian code. Cronenberg, on the other hand, makes the Freudian significance of the male protagonist’s voyeuristic investigation exceedingly obvious; there’s no need to decode.\r\n\r\nIn his 1988 film <em>Dead Ringers</em>, about two identical twins sharing the same office, apartment, and women, the male protagonists are gynecologists and the female lead is not only an actress (an obvious occupation for an exhibitionist), but more importantly his patient. When we first meet the female lead, she is subjected to the male protagonist’s incriminating gaze in the most physical of ways. She lies in his office with her legs open and the male protagonist peering into her vagina. He tells her she has a defect, and later they engage in sadomasochistic sex in which she is tied to a bed with medical tubes. The female lead cries, “You’re gonna spank me, doc. I’ve been bad, and I need to be punished.” It is as though her physical defect is deserving of punishment in the same way as Marnie’s psychological defect (her kleptomania), which is physically manifested only through the metaphor of the purse. The sadomasochism in Cronenberg’s films therefore reveals the Freudian implications of the relationship between the male protagonist and female lead to the viewer unfamiliar with Freud’s ideas.\r\n\r\nMoreover, because Cronenberg’s films point out the sadomasochistic nature of cinema itself, we are labeled as participants in such events, an idea rarely acknowledged by most moviegoers. Jean-Francois Lyotard writes of the corporeality of cinema in his essay, “The Unconscious as Mise-en-scene”: “It is the transcribing on and for bodies, considered as multi-sensory potentialities, which is the work characteristic of the mise-en-scene… The idea of performance…seems linked to the idea of inscription on the body” (88). It is as though moviegoers seek to be acted upon physically in some way, to have their bodies altered. Yet it is unlikely that most film spectators have read Jean-Francois Lyotard. Such a theory would be unnecessary when applied to a Cronenberg film, which has the psychoanalysis already built into the narrative. For example, in Videodrome, watching television induces a brain tumor in Professor Oblivion, and eventually persuades the male protagonist to shoot himself, exclaiming, “long live the new flesh.” Lyotard’s analysis of cinema as closely linked to the body, if applied to Videodrome, might seem trite and even understated.\r\n\r\nCronenberg’s films also point out ways in which artists like Hitchcock sadistically exploit women for voyeuristic entertainment. For example, Hitchcock casts beautiful, voluptuous women as the female leads so that they can be gazed at by the audience through the eyes of the male protagonist. Cronenberg points out the perverse sadomasochism implicit in such an artistic choice. In the film <em>Crash</em>, for example, one character says, “I want really big tits so the audience can see them get all cut up and crushed on the dashboard.” In Hitchcock films, we go to the cinema in order to voyeuristically violate the female lead. In Cronenberg films, the female lead’s violation is physical. In<em> Dead Ringers</em>, when the male protagonist has gone insane, he invents torture instruments which he calls “gynecological instruments for mutant women.” An artist who owns a gallery displays these misogynist sadomasochistic devices in a way that evokes the way Hitchcock panders to spectators by violating his female leads (see Figure 3).\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_318" align="alignright" width="500" caption="Figure 3"]<a href="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image007.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-318 " title="Figure 3" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image007.gif" alt="Figure 3" width="500" height="295" /></a>[/caption]\r\n\r\nBut since Cronenberg is doing the same things as Hitchcock, isn’t he just part of the same problem identified by Mulvey? As Janet Maslin wrote in her review of <em>Videodrome</em>for the <em>New York Times</em>, “There are times when it is dangerously unclear, in the midst of Max’s lurid, sadomasochistic fantasies, whether Videodrome is far removed from the kind of sensationalism it seeks to satirize” (Maslin). Movie critic James Bowman, in his article, “On Sex and Violence,” criticizes Cronenberg and other directors such as David Lynch when he says, “Are they, by an amazing stroke of irony, actually ridiculing the sex-and-violence connection they are ostensibly promoting? No, probably not” (64). It is possible, though doubtful, that Cronenberg is not trying to make cinematic sadomasochism so unpalatable that we reject it in all its forms.\r\n\r\nYet even if Cronenberg is not ridiculing the sex-and-violence connection, even if he is promoting it on the screen, he is probably only doing so to prevent it in real life. The main character of <em>Videodrome</em>, Max Ren, chooses programming for his pornography channel for a living, presenting hidden urges to the public in a way that parallels David Cronenberg’s role as a director. As Max Ren puts it, “Better on TV than in the streets.” According to such logic, enacting these fantasies on screen prevents the viewer from enacting them in real life.\r\n\r\nSo perhaps for those who are attracted to the type of relationship Mulvey finds so disgustingly misogynist, Cronenberg also serves a more socially positive role than Hitchcock. In Hitchock’s <em>Marnie</em>, a sexually frigid man-hating habitual thief called Marnie marries the man who catches her in exchange for his silence to the authorities. On one occasion, the male protagonist says to the female lead, “I’m fighting a powerful impulse to beat the hell out of you.” The male protagonist manages to beat that impulse; perhaps as a result, the sadomasochist spectator is denied the ability to satisfy his violent urges vicariously through the male protagonist. The viewer is allowed to experience voyeuristic sadomasochism, but that is not fulfilling enough, because it would probably not be physical enough for a self-identified sadomasochist.\r\n\r\nBecause the Cronenberg protagonist barely fights the impulse to “beat the hell out of” the female lead, we are allowed to experience the same rush that the male protagonist feels. As Professor Oblivion says, “Whatever appears on the video screen emerges as raw experience for those who watch it. The hallucination can therefore act as a substitute for reality.” And according to another character in <em>Videodrome</em>, “You don’t have to actually hurt anybody. You just have to think about it.” This kind of dialogue supports the notion that even if Cronenberg is not far removed from the kind of sensationalism he seeks to satirize—even if he is a panderer like Hitchcock—he still aims to perform a socially positive act.\r\n\r\nYet the majority of us don’t have sadomasochist urges, or if we do, we derive more horror than pleasure from them. It is this “mainstream” audience member that ought to be the main target in Cronenberg’s war against the misogynist cinematic vocabulary of mainstream Hollywood. Because Cronenberg not only acknowledges but explores the grotesque physicality of Hitchcock’s sadomasochism, he lays his perversions out on the table, which makes them far more accessible to the viewer unschooled in Freud. Hitchcock was popular for his ability to satisfy his audience’s urges. For the sadomasochist, perhaps, Cronenberg plays a similar role.\r\n\r\nBut Cronenberg makes most “normal” viewers so disgusted and ashamed of these urges that for many it is difficult to “like” a Cronenberg film. As Roger Ebert wrote regarding <em>Crash</em>, “I admired it, although I cannot say I ‘liked’ it” (“Crash”). His feelings toward Dead Ringers are similar: “It’s the kind of movie where you ask people how they liked it, and they say, ‘well, it was well made,’ and then they wince” (“Dead Ringers”). Anthony McCosker writes, “Often manifesting as outrage and discomfort, the unsettling spectatorial experience of <em>Crash</em> is far from empty” (45). He also summarizes the critical response at large: “Reviews in news media around the world reiterated the moral outrage expressed in the British news media” (38). When the film was screened at Cannes, some attendants fled the theater in protest, horror, or a combination of both. The film was even banned for a period of time in Great Britain.\r\n\r\nMonohla Dargis attempts to explain these types of reactions in her review of the 2005 Cronenberg film, <em>A History of Violence</em>. In that film, a humble family man’s transformation into a local hero through a brutal act of “heroism” causes a chain of violent repercussions and forces him to defend his family while attempting to restore peace and order into their lives. The film traces the protagonist’s effort to grapple and subdue the violent impulses within himself that arise in the wake of his heroic deed. In one scene, the male protagonist loses control and rapes his wife on a wooden staircase. She writes, “The great kick of the movie—or rather its great kick in the gut—comes from Mr. Cronenberg’s refusal to let us indulge in movie violence without paying a price” (Dargis). Botting and Wilson provide a similar explanation for viewers’ responses to Cronenberg in their essay “Automatic Lovers”: “Crash refuses to evoke or simulate the sensational and spectacular effects that one would expect from a film that draws an equivalence between sex and car crashes” (189). That both reviews speak of some sort of “refusal” on Cronenberg’s part—the refusal to indulge, the refusal to sensationalize—is significant. Essentially, he is refusing to pander to our expectations for sanitized sadomasochism and sanitized misogyny, expectations which directors like Hitchcock catered to by expressing our urges through voyeurism and purses, metaphors for much deeper and more physical perversions. Cronenberg refuses to let us ignore the sickness in these ostensibly sanitized films, and more importantly, the sickness in ourselves as viewers of those films. Roger Ebert describes the relationship between Cronenberg and the sanitization of mainstream Hollywood quite clearly:\r\n<blockquote>Take out the crashes and the injuries, and substitute the usual romantic movie story line, and it would be easy to understand this progression. For the first crash, substitute a chance meeting at a party. Have the husband make a fool of himself. Have them meet later by chance. Have them survive a dangerous experience. Let them feel sudden sexual attraction. No one in the audience would bat an eye if there was then a sex scene. (“Crash”)</blockquote>\r\nAdverse reactions are key to provoking debate, says Anthony McCosker: “The media event of Crash, then, affords the chance to rethink the general notion of sadomasochistic sexuality in terms of a more concerted examination of masochism… as mass media experience” (31, emphasis mine). Similarly, he argues that “this film and the media events that encompass it have provided a site for an encounter with the corporeal specificity of masochistic sexuality” (37, emphasis mine). We can therefore gather that Cronenberg’s film has allowed us to consider masochism in mass media as a corporeal event.\r\n\r\nIt seems, then, as though Laura Mulvey’s predictions have been proven correct, though in a slightly different way than she intended. She hoped to make the sadistic gaze of the camera more material and more obvious to the viewer by perhaps allowing the figures onscreen to acknowledge the presence of the camera and the spectator. After all, voyeurism depends on a one-way dominant gaze. Mary Ann Doane explains, “If a character looks at and speaks to the spectator, this constitutes an acknowledgment that the character is seen and heard in a radically different space and is therefore generally read as transgressive” (378). Yet in <em>Videodrome</em>, the female lead often looks at and speaks to the male protagonist when he watches her on television, the effect of which is indeed quite jarring. These instances are symptomatic of a more general attempt on Cronenberg’s part to make us aware of the protagonist’s gaze and to materialize it into physical sadomasochism rather than voyeuristic sadomasochism. As predicted by Mulvey and pointed out by McCosker, the effect of this materialization is an awareness that provides an opportunity for analysis. Furthermore, as Mulvey and various other critics like Roger Ebert suggest, this analysis leads to the destruction of pleasure. This approach, described by Ebert in his review of <em>Dead Ringers</em> as “the objectivity of a scientist” (“Dead Ringers”), is far different from the usual romanticization of voyeuristic sadomasochism in mainstream Hollywood. In Rear Window, for example, the diegetic soundtrack consists mainly of a love song that the female lead claims “sounds like it’s being written just for us.” Cronenberg is just as much of a voyeur as Hitchcock, but unlike Hitchcock he manages to subvert the very techniques he employs.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'David Cronenberg: The Voyeur of Utter Destruction', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'david-cronenberg-the-voyeur-of-utter-destruction', '', '', '2012-03-23 15:09:32', '2012-03-23 15:09:32', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=280', 0, 'essay', '', 0),

(282, 5, '2011-12-19 07:57:18', '2011-12-19 07:57:18', 'Edward W. Said left such a strong impression on Mid-East politics that even his critics defined him as “a familiar face on the network news—an urbane, articulate man, invariably dressed in an elegant suit and tie, who could always be counted on to provide polished, unaccented, pro-Palestinian (or, more generally, pro-Arab or pro-Moslem) spin on recent Mideast developments” (Bawer 620). Yet this “urbane, articulate man” shunned U.S. Media attention after Saudi Arabian nationals hijacked two passenger airlines, and used them as guided missiles in a fatal attack on U.S. soil the morning of September 11th, 2001. If this character, Said, “could always be counted on to provide” his interpretations, or his “spin on recent Mideast developments,” then what were his reasons for withdrawing from the media attention he had previously enjoyed?\r\n\r\nAlthough Said did publish a piece in the <em>Observer</em> (a U.K.-based paper) five days after the terror attacks, its somewhat sympathetic stance towards the terrorists was blasted by Bruce Bawer, an independent critic who has written articles for (among others) the <em>New Republic</em>, the <em>Nation</em>, and the <em>New York Times Magazine</em> and whose book reviews have appeared in the <em>New York Times Book Review</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and the <em>Times Literary Supplement</em>. Bawer claimed that after reading Said’s piece in the <em>Observer</em>,\r\n\r\none no longer wonders why it appeared in a British newspaper rather than on the op-ed page of Said’s usual high-profile outlet, the <em>New York Times</em>—whose readers, many of them ordinarily receptive to Professor Said’s critiques of Western democracy and whitewashing of Islamic tyranny and terror, were perhaps too busy that week trying to recover from the violent assault on their city to be able to profit from his wisdom.\r\n\r\nBawer’s insinuation is that New York City, once the bastion of Said’s liberal pro-Muslim ideals, could no longer afford the luxury of self-criticisms, and thus, had no use for Said’s radical opinions. Could this be why Said avoided U.S. media interviews after the September 11th attacks?\r\n\r\nPerhaps an understanding of Said’s tumultuous life could shed light on this question. Said, as he narrates in his memoir <em>Out of Place</em>, was born in 1935 as a Protestant Arab Palestinian in Jerusalem, Palestine. His father was a very successful business man, giving Said a privileged upbringing from which he could observe the events that shaped the modern-day Middle East. He was raised in Cairo, Egypt, where he experienced the direct effects of British, and then American, imperialism. He was able to enjoy summers in Lebanon, where he began to notice the undercurrents of cultural divisiveness that still affect the region. He experienced first-hand the controversial declaration of Israel as a state and the subsequent displacement of countless Palestinians. In 1951 Said began his studies in America at a private New England High School. He continued his American education by attending Princeton, and later Harvard, en-route to a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature. Said remained apolitical until the 1967 war, when a second wave of Palestinian refugees was triggered during a six-day conflict between Israel and the combined states of Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan. This event, and its dire consequences, generated the intense interest in politics, specifically in the creation of a Palestinian state, which Said maintained throughout the remainder of his life.\r\n\r\nBut the question remains, why would Said refuse media attention in the days (and years) following 9/11? Why would he pass up such an ideal opportunity to speak to an American public about an issue very dear to his heart? Could Bawer be correct in that Said no longer had a receptive audience?\r\n\r\nSaid’s own voice indicates otherwise. Several comments made after September 11th indicate that he withdrew because he feared being presented as a definitive subject matter expert. It was this notion of a subject expert, or a single person who could classify and explain a vast group of cultures, that Said definitively condemned in <em>Orientalism</em>, a book first published in 1976. In fact, one might say that Said’s refusal of media attention was the direct extension of his main argument in <em>Orientalism</em>.\r\n\r\nSaid summarizes this argument as the issue of “whether indeed there can be a true representation of anything, or whether any and all representations, because they are representations, are embedded first in the language and then in the culture, institutions, and political ambience of the representer” (<em>Orientalism</em> 272). Said argues in <em>Orientalism</em> that constructs such as the Orient contain inaccuracies because they are created by individuals: individuals with their own political, career, and personal agendas. He feels that these simplified identities (such as the East and the West) involve “the construction of opposites and ‘others’ whose actuality is always subject to the continuous interpretation and re-interpretation of their differences from ‘us’” (<em>Orientalism</em> 332). In other words, the East and West cannot be pointed to as physical entities. Instead, they exist as constructs that allow one group of people to differentiate themselves from another.\r\n\r\nSaid criticizes the people who forge on without admitting these subjective interpretations. He observes that within the field of Oriental Studies (whose practitioners are labeled orientalists) there is a predominant view that “such things as an Islamic society, an Arab mind, an Oriental psyche” do exist (<em>Orientalism</em> 301). Said counters this view by claiming that “cultures and civilizations are so interrelated and interdependent as to beggar any unitary or simply delineated description of their individuality” (<em>Orientalism</em> 347). Throughout <em>Orientalism</em> Said argues against broad stereotypes and against “the notion that there are geographical spaces with indigenous, radically ‘different’ inhabitants who can be defined on the basis of some religion, culture, or racial essence proper to that geographical space” (<em>Orientalism</em> 322). Although Said makes extensive use of western generalizations of “the East” he explicitly states in the Afterword (written in 1994) that he is not solely criticizing Western imperialism. Rather, he is using specific examples to rebuke the notion that any large group of people can be adequately defined by their religion, geographic location, or ethnicity.\r\n\r\nOne of Said’s post-September 11th fears was that the American public might begin to equate Osama bin Laden (or other extremist figures) with the entirety of the Islamic religion (“Fears”). While bin Laden is certainly representative of a very small subset of Islamic fundamentalists, he does not represent the larger Muslim community. But who would be qualified to speak about the Muslim community? Perhaps a Muslim academic, or better yet, perhaps the Muslim philosopher Akeel Bilgrami, whom Said praised in “Impossible Histories.” Bilgrami is a Professor of Philosophy at Columbia University and has extensively explored the philosophical aspects of how people identify themselves and others. As someone who was raised within the “Eastern” country of India he can shed light on how he regards the Muslim community. In an article titled “The clash within civilizations,” he contends that the majority of Muslims “have no particular desire to perpetrate atrocious (and self-defeating) acts of terrorist violence in Islam’s name, no particular desire to live lives observant in the last detail of Shariah laws, no particular desires to live under the tyrannies of oppressive governments that impose the strictest of Islamic ideologies upon them, such as for instance in Saudi Arabia or Iran” (Bilgrami, “Clash” 88). Bilgrami offers a historical, social, and economic perspective to the problem instead of broadly categorizing the East with sweeping statements. He explains that “most Muslims are not absolutists [his term for fundamentalists] at all, and are in fact deeply opposed to the absolutists in their midst. This is evident in the fact that whenever there have been elections, the ‘fundamentalist’ parties have failed to gain power, whether in Iran or in Pakistan” (Bilgrami, “Lessons” 32). He further interprets the animosity many Muslims feel towards the West as not being directed at freedom or modernity, but rather, at the “naked, corporate-driven wrongs of American and Western dominance of their regions” (Bilgrami, “Lessons” 32). By way of comparison, Said’s critic Bawer claims that “a substantial percentage of Moslems are in fact religious fundamentalists who despise individual liberty and sexual equality, who believe profoundly that all sorts of things should be punished by death, and who readily cheer acts of violence directed against innocent civilians in the West” (Bawer 622).\r\n\r\nBawer relies on heavily unsupported generalizations. He claims that “a substantial percentage of Moslems” are fundamentalists without ever citing a figure or where that figure was drawn from. Bilgrami, by contrast, offers a clear account of fundamentalist support by referring to specific elections in Pakistan where fundamentalist groups have consistently received less than ten percent of the popular vote (Bilgrami, “Clash” 90). Bawer, through his broad generalization of Muslims, represents a striking example of the mentality Said condemned in <em>Orientalism</em>. Bilgrami’s approach, however, of carefully examining the conditions surrounding a group, of acknowledging the motivations for their actions, and of treating them as a diverse group represents the tactic that Said supported. But, the distinction between Bawer and Bilgrami is more subtle than it first appears.\r\n\r\nFrom the surface it appears that Bilgrami, because he was raised in a Muslim country, can offer valid assertions about Muslims, while Bawer, because he is an outsider, is doomed to hopelessly inadequate generalizations. This misses a fine point of Said’s, that any identity (such as “Muslim”, “Arab”, or “American”) is a constructed image that generalizes a broad group of people. Even though Bilgrami was raised in a Muslim country, his definition of “Muslim” is no more accurate than Bawer’s is. Or rather, his definition is just as hopelessly inaccurate as Bawer’s is. Where Bilgrami does succeed, however, is by attempting to understand that “Muslim” is a man-made term that refers to a large disparate group of people. Bilgrami recognizes that the beliefs held by individuals within this group will vary wildly while Bawer attempts to polarize the group into a black-or-white, either-or, extremist vs. liberal perspective. Said hoped that a humanist understanding such as Bilgrami’s would help prevent “the terrible conflicts that herd people under falsely unifying rubrics such as ‘America’, ‘the west’, or ‘Islam’ and invent collective identities for large numbers of individuals who are actually quite diverse” (“Window”).\r\n\r\nBut what does this tell us about our original question? Why did Said choose to avoid post-September 11th U.S. media contact? With a solid understanding of Said’s historical perspective on the bipolar constructs of East and West we can now investigate this question using his own voice.\r\n\r\nIn an article published in <em>Harper’s</em> magazine in July 2002, titled “Impossible Histories,” Said assaults the implication that he might have some insight into the events of September 11th. Through a rhetorical question he exclaims “what could I know about the crazed fanatics who committed suicide in the slaughter of innocents” (“Impossible Histories” 69). This is very telling, because it sets up a very clear distinction between Said’s area of knowledge, and the area of knowledge required to understand “the smoldering twin towers” (“Impossible Histories” 69). Said had always proclaimed himself a secularist, so from his perspective he had no insights into the people who flew airplanes into buildings in the name of religious fervor. While he did feel that he had contextual information about the socio-political conditions that might lead a person to attack the United States, he felt that such information was not welcomed by the American populace. Two months after the attacks Said addressed this in an article for the Arab American News. In the article he claimed that “any attempt to place the horrors of what occurred on September 11 in a context that includes US actions and rhetoric is either attacked or dismissed as somehow condoning the terrorist bombardment” (“Fears”). So although Said felt that he could provide contextual information about the events leading to the September 11th attacks, he sensed that this was not what the U.S. media wanted.\r\n\r\nInstead, he observes, “bookstores in the US are filled with shabby screeds bearing screaming headlines about Islam and terror, the Arab threat and the Muslim menace, all of them written by political polemicists pretending to knowledge imparted by experts who have supposedly penetrated to the heart of these strange oriental peoples” (“Window”). He further criticizes the media as assigning “itself the role of producing so-called ‘experts’” who then support “the kind of simplified view of the world” that U.S. political strategists have provided (“Window”). Small wonder, then, that Said might not “want to be tokenized or made to represent the ‘other’ point of view” (“Impossible Histories” 69).\r\n\r\nBut Said’s refusal to interview with the U.S. media stretches beyond avoiding the label of “other.” His refusal was directed instead at the U.S. notion of providing “experts” to aggregate and summarize disparate regions of the world. Said’s rebellion, then, was not against being labeled as pro-Muslim, but instead it was against the thought that the East could be labeled, and further, that it could actually be objectively described by any one person without understanding the historical, social, and economic context. The U.S. media criticized his contextual information as “condoning terrorism,” yet they still asked him for information. Why? So that they could produce a sensational headline that would drive Americans, out of fear, to purchase more papers, to view more news media, and to further the development of the “us” versus “them” divide. Yet, as was illustrated above, this type of bipolar classification is exactly what Said argued against in <em>Orientalism</em>. So is it any surprise that Said refused U.S. media attention following the September 11th terrorist attacks? Of course not! The only way for Said to maintain his beliefs, as described in <em>Orientalism</em>, was to refuse media attention.\r\n\r\nBut how is this knowledge helpful? Said refused to cater to the desires of the U.S. media, and in so doing illustrated that the U.S. media still operates under the assumption that large numbers of people can be grouped together under a single name. This is evident when the media refers to a “Chinese” identity, or a “Muslim” identity. The assumption, then, is that a subject expert can accurately define the attributes of these identities. This categorization, as was explained above, risks oversimplifying many of today’s current events. Said recognized this, and claimed these so-called objective identities were no more than a subjective means of distinguishing one group of people from another as “us” versus “them”. He argued instead that we should investigate the social and economic context in which events occur, and thereby arrive at a more accurate understanding of those events. But, as was illustrated by Said’s dilemma above, the U.S. media does not take this approach. Therefore Said’s legacy, and challenge, to us is to force the media to provide us with the contextual information necessary for a broad understanding of their issues.', 'Said’s Post-September 11th Media Presence', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'saids-post-september-11th-media-presence', '', '', '2012-03-23 15:40:45', '2012-03-23 15:40:45', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=282', 0, 'essay', '', 0);

A preference for broad strokes, for the distortion and flattening of character and the reduction of events to narrative, has been for well over a hundred years the way the city presents itself.”\r\n—Joan Didion</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\nWith its bright colors, rays of sun showering upon faces of influential leaders of different races, and inspiring slogans coined to stir the public to bridge the gap between races and socioeconomic divisions, a mural in the Soundview neighborhood of the South Bronx on 174th St. entitled <em>We Are Here to Awaken from the Illusion of Our Separateness</em> (Figs. 1-4) exemplifies a trend to create captivating and educational murals throughout New York City that deal with major socioeconomic and racial issues. The mural in the South Bronx gives the impression, even by virtue of its title alone, of a community with relatively surmountable social barriers between races and classes, in which “our separateness” is insignificant and the solution is to simply “awaken,” by realizing that our differences are “an illusion” — one that, in reality, doesn’t exist.\r\n\r\nBut taking a step back and viewing the community in which this mural is located leads one to a much less optimistic outlook on the future of social and racial equality than the mural would have one believe. According to a recent <em>New York Times</em> article, as of July 2006, Soundview, “long one of the city’s poorest communities”, doesn’t have one bank in hundreds of blocks filled with housing projects; in contrast to the “illusion of our separateness” described on the mural, one resident is said to travel 3 miles twice a week to the closest bank in the neighboring town of White Plains (NY Times). The reality of Soundview is that it’s “the city''s top shopping area—for car thieves” (Venezia); it’s an area “infested with crime and drugs” (Tran), and a neighborhood in which racial tensions found their breeding ground in 1999 when Amadou Diallo, an unarmed 22-year-old black man, was shot dead by 4 white cops. While the mural in Soundview considers this apparent state of affairs a type of “illusion,” the history of the neighborhood seems to render the mural the real illusion.\r\n\r\nThe proliferation of such murals, which tend to blur racial and socioeconomic riffs while celebrating that which New Yorkers share in common is what Joan Didion refers to, in her essay entitled “Sentimental Journeys,” as a “sentimental narrative,” a conception that “a reliance on certain magical gestures,” often substituted for effective political action, can alter the destiny of a city (225, 279).\r\n\r\nDidion traces the development of this narrative throughout New York City’s history, as authored by the media and public officials. She claims that these officials tended to “obscure not only the city’s actual tensions of race and class but also, more significantly, the civic and commercial arrangements that rendered those tensions irreconcilable” (Didion 280). Didion examines several social projects in the city, which received two kinds of publicity. Positive narratives focused on how the projects fostered racial and social blending. Negative narratives depicted the projects as flashpoints for crime. Both representations ignored the underlying issues of economic disparity and racial tension, which can lay the ground for violence and crime.\r\n\r\nDidion points to the creation of Central Park as a part of this ongoing, obscuring sentimental narrative. While Frederick Olmstead, the park’s creator, described it as a place which would “force into contact the good and the bad, the gentleman and the rowdy,” he ignored the fact that these groups may not share the same interests, and “the extent to which the condition of being rich was predicated upon the continued neediness of a working class” (Didion 282, 283). In ignoring such crucial facts while at the same time emphasizing less realistic visions of the park, Olmstead was participating in the sentimental narrative of New York.\r\n\r\nDidion analyzes specific instances of crime as the root of social problems; the touchstone example for Didion’s essay is the well-known “Central Park Jogger” case of 1990, in which a young woman was gang-raped. According to Didion, the media presentation ignored the racial and social tensions that were the real root causes of the rape. It did so by presenting a “conflation of victim and city,” in which “the crime’s ‘story’ would be found, its lesson, its encouraging promise of narrative resolution” (Didion 260). Didion describes how the victim in this case, known by the public as “The Jogger,” went unnamed in the press, and was instead used as a symbol for what John Gutfreund, the chairman of the company where the victim worked, described as “what makes this city so vibrant and so great” (260). On the other hand, her attackers were constantly named in order to show that “what was wrong with the city had been identified, and its names were Raymond Santana, Yusef Salaam” (Didion 270). According to William R. Taylor of SUNY, whom Didion cites, in publicizing crimes this way the media “localized suffering in particular moments…confined it to particular occasions [and] smoothed over differences,” thereby ignoring the more basic underlying tensions that allowed for such occasions (Didion 284).\r\n\r\nPublic murals in New York City comprise a new chapter of this ongoing narrative. The Groundswell Community Mural Project, the group responsible for the mural in Soundview, advertises itself online as “a New York City based nonprofit that brings together professional artists, grassroots organizations and communities in partnership to create high quality murals in under-represented neighborhoods” (groundswellmural.org). The murals displayed online, like the mural in Soundview, depict fundamental racial and socioeconomic equality in New York City and stress the need to improve its condition. Murals like these figure most prominently in relatively poor neighborhoods like the South Bronx and Harlem, where they most vividly emphasize the need for social change. In Washington Heights, another relatively poor neighborhood in NYC, a mural spanning the length of an entire building was painted to simultaneously help solve the problems of lead paint in that neighborhood and add an aesthetic quality to the neighborhood as well (groundswellmural.org). The mural, which portrays people with a bounty of fruits and vegetables, visiting doctors and taking care of their overall health, is one example of a mural that touches the sentiments and evokes positive feelings about life and health in a neighborhood in order to help amend more sweeping, general communal problems; in this case, the idea was that by using the mural to teach people about the positive effects of a healthy diet and medical treatment in helping to heal lead poisoning, the problem of lead poisoning would be diminished (groundswellmural.org). In Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, a group of kids painted a colorful mural entitled <em>One Community, Many Voices</em> (Fig. 5), featuring a plethora of flags flying in the air, rainbows, and people of many races, in order to promote diversity. A mural in Harlem entitled<em>Voices</em> (Figs. 6 &amp; 7) was, according to one of the teens involved in the painting, meant as a way “to get a better reality what is really needed in the urban communities [sic]. Whether it is more education or police for safe streets you know what the issues are by interviewing community members and the teens” (groundswellmural.org). “Painting a mural,” this person says, “is a great example to the young people of how hard work can pay off and how a task that was set can be completed.” According to Groundswell, “our work inspires youth, communities and artists to take active ownership of their future and equips them with the tools necessary for social change” (groundswellmural.org). It’s in this conflation of the mural with more basic “social change” that the sentimental narrative is located.\r\n\r\nJane Jacobs advocates a similar program for social change, according to which it’s precisely those sentiment-stirring, less drastic agendas that should be implemented. In her essay, she focuses on the need for “sidewalk contacts,” public settings which “bring together people who do not know each other in an intimate, private social fashion, and in most cases do not care to know each other in that fashion” (73, 72). These casual public contacts include “stopping by at the bar for a beer, getting advice from the grocer and giving advice to the newsstand man, comparing opinions with other customers at the bakery, etc.,” all of which serve to create “an almost unconscious assumption of general street support when the chips are down” (Jacobs 73). Jacobs admits that these contacts can’t “automatically overcome segregation and discrimination [because] too many other kinds of efforts are also required to right these injustices” (94). However, she writes, “to build and to rebuild big cities whose sidewalk[s] are unsafe…<em>can</em> make it <em>much harder</em> for American cities to overcome discrimination no matter how much effort is expended” (94, emphais, Jacobs''). While taking issue with her own suggestion, Jacobs concludes that seemingly trivial advancements actually lay the foundation for building a more integrated society.\r\n\r\nJacobs, who repeatedly stresses the benefits of positive sidewalk environments as opposed to more formal city social projects, objects to the use of projects similar to privately funded murals as a means of engendering that “feeling for the public identity of the people” (72), a feeling of sympathy for the general public which can’t be attained without informal public contact. However, her more basic assumption that, while the individual small steps taken towards social improvement may seem “utterly trivial,…the sum is not trivial at all” certainly lends credence to mural projects (73). Indeed, two positive outcomes, each consistent with hopes of unity and a shared public experience expressed by Jacobs, emerge from the creation of murals that depict unity and social harmony. First, the content of the murals—such as the mural in Soundview, which discounts the class divisions in our society—invokes and engenders a sense of social unity, thereby creating an almost subconscious collective feeling of brotherhood and equality. The images of leaders from different races, who played crucial roles in eliminating racial tensions, inspire us to develop a world in which these leaders’ values are expressed. Also inspiring are the messages contained in the murals calling for social action and community service. For example, the Soundview mural features the words, “I charge you to do something” (groundswellmural.org). Aside from the finished products, though, the process of creating the murals is itself an experience of racial amalgamation. On Groundswell’s website, photographs of mural painting often show diverse groups of young adults enjoying the experience. Indeed, Groundswell’s mission statement contains phrases such as “bring together” and “partnership”; the organization’s fundamental premise is that mural painting will “bridge cultural, ethnic, class and generational divides” (groundswellmural.org).\r\n\r\nHowever, the idea that minor aesthetic improvements to so-called “underrepresented” neighborhoods can make a significant social impact is more sentimental than realistic—as if the lack of political representation is more characteristic of these neighborhoods’ problems than, for example, poverty. While the murals certainly do help to beautify rundown neighborhoods and may encourage some of the public contact desired by Jacobs as well as foster a feeling of community, they actually amount to no more than what Didion, quoting William R. Taylor of SUNY Stony Brook, calls, “empathy without political compassion” (Didion 284). While presenting a large and noticeable façade of concern for communal socioeconomic misfortunes, these murals, like many of the components of the sentimental narrative that Didion mentions, divert our attention from finding effective, concrete solutions to enormous problems. While the concern that the murals portray may be genuine, it tends to be perceived as a substitution for or at least a crucial step towards social improvement. <em>A Daily News</em> article (2004) about the dedication ceremony of one of Groundswell’s mural projects in Brooklyn commemorating young victims of street violence cites several Brooklyn residents who describe the mural in grandiose terms. Jasmine, a 15-year-old girl who contributed to the mural said, “[I]t’s not just a picture…it’s a loss in our community…there’s too much violence, and it needs to stop.” One resident, Kevin Diaz, exclaimed, “I think that people will get a good moral out of this, that they should talk it out instead of using violence” (Hays). The idea that the mural isn’t “just a picture” and that people will learn valuable lessons from it affords these murals too much significance and doesn’t take into account the more basic issues of class and racial segregation.\r\n\r\nThe logical flaws that threaten to undermine Jacobs’s endorsement of “sidewalk contacts” as remedies to our social problems challenge the notion that murals make a difference in similar ways. For example, Jacobs’s assertion that “sidewalk public contact and sidewalk public safety…bear directly on…segregation and racial discrimination” and help to ameliorate problems of segregation seems implausible when considering the fact that the segregated races to which she refers don’t even share the same sidewalks to begin with (94). Similarly, creating murals in poor neighborhoods, while helping to beautify them, doesn’t help to bridge the racial and economic gaps that give birth to these neighborhoods in the first place.\r\n\r\nSome of the language employed in the murals and their titles also points to certain basic misconceptions on the part of the murals’ artists about their effectiveness. <em>We Are Here to Awaken from the Illusion of Our Separateness</em> is a striking example of the way in which murals use language to blur social divisions. Such misconceptions threaten to distract our society from facing socioeconomic problems head-on through the creation of better jobs for the poor and better public school education. By appealing to our senses, these murals also appeal to our sentimental notions of New York City as a melting pot, in which we all become “one community” whose differences are an illusion.\r\n\r\nSeveral blocks away from the mural about unity in Soundview there’s another mural, which in turn is several blocks away from where Amadou Diallo was shot. Jovino Borrero, the owner of a small shop in Soundview, commissioned an artist from Harlem to paint this mural in commemoration of Amadou Diallo in 2001 (Tran). However, this mural isn’t so sentimental or inspiring. It depicts 4 white policemen in white hoods and, next to a portrait of Amadou Diallo, the Statue of Liberty holding a gun. The effect of the mural is to suggest that the cause of Diallo’s murder was racial discrimination, and that this is what lies behind the country’s façade of liberty. This mural may be a more accurate portrayal than the more sentimental murals of the way in which Soundview residents view racial segregation and class divisions. While beautifying neighborhoods and fostering senses of unity and public identity are necessary projects, mural painting should not cloud our perception of the unfortunate reality in which we live, nor should it defer our search for realistic solutions that will help change that reality.\r\n<h2><strong>Appendix: Groundswell Murals</strong></h2>\r\n[caption id="attachment_95" align="alignright" width="665" caption="image001"]<img class="size-full wp-image-95 " title="image001" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image001.jpg" alt="image001" width="665" height="196" />[/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_343" align="alignright" width="171" caption="Figure 2"]<img class="size-full wp-image-343 " title="Figure 2" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Figure2.gif" alt="Figure 2" width="171" height="130" />[/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_83" align="alignright" width="171" caption="image007-728525"]<img class="size-full wp-image-83 " title="image007-728525" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image007-728525.jpg" alt="image007-728525" width="171" height="137" />[/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_87" align="alignright" width="395" caption="image004"]<img class="size-full wp-image-87 " title="image004" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image004.jpg" alt="image004" width="395" height="214" />[/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_86" align="alignright" width="673" caption="image005"]<img class="size-full wp-image-86 " title="image005" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image005.jpg" alt="image005" width="673" height="212" />[/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_99" align="alignright" width="257" caption="image012"]<img class="size-full wp-image-99 " title="image012" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image012.jpg" alt="image012" width="257" height="193" />[/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_82" align="alignright" width="333" caption="image007"]<img class="size-full wp-image-82 " title="image007" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image007.jpg" alt="image007" width="333" height="221" />[/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_81" align="alignright" width="244" caption="image008"]<img class="size-full wp-image-81  " title="image008" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image008.jpg" alt="image008" width="244" height="429" />[/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_78" align="alignright" width="322" caption="image009"]<img class="size-full wp-image-78 " title="image009" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image009.jpg" alt="image009" width="322" height="381" />[/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_77" align="alignright" width="360" caption="image010"]<img class="size-full wp-image-77 " title="image010" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image010.jpg" alt="image010" width="360" height="208" />[/caption]', 'Good Ole Murals for the Sentiments', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'good-ole-murals-for-the-sentiments', '', '', '2012-03-23 15:19:44', '2012-03-23 15:19:44', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=283', 0, 'essay', '', 0),
(284, 5, '2011-12-19 07:56:54', '2011-12-19 07:56:54', 'Based on reviews and articles I had read about the new faux documentary <em>Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan</em>, I expected that when I actually saw it, I would be disgusted. I imagined sitting low in my theatre seat, covering my eyes, horrified by the displays on the screen. When I finally got to see the movie, I was disappointed at my lack of disgust and horror. It was not nearly as outrageous or offensive as I felt all those articles had promised it would be. My disappointment made me think about my extensive exposure to vulgar comedy and the nature of comedy in America. Perhaps I have been desensitized to bodily functions and nudity, especially when they are presented in the name of comedy. Perhaps years filled with<em> American Pie</em>’s and <em>Scary Movie’s</em>, capped by the summer of raunchy sex farces (like <em>Wedding Crashers</em> and <em>The 40-Year-Old Virgin</em>) have made it hard for me to be shocked and appalled by anything, even the scene of a hairy naked man wrestling a fat naked man, which constitutes the climax of the Borat movie.\r\n\r\nFor those who have not seen the movie (or read every article written about it) the idea is as follows: a journalist from Kazakhstan named Borat drives an ice cream truck across America, hoping to meet the woman of his dreams, Pamela Anderson. Because Borat is new to America and knows nothing of American decorum or tradition, he unwittingly does and says things to the locals along his path that both infuriate them and end up making them look like horrible people. Take for example the man working at a rodeo who, trusting the seemingly simple foreigner, tells Borat that America is currently working on making it acceptable to “string up” homosexuals. The concept of lulling unsuspecting locals into a false sense of confidence so that they will reveal their innermost prejudices may sound cruel and potentially humiliating for all involved, but the movie has been very well received in America, debuting at number one and managing to keep the top spot for the following week as well. It is difficult to find an unfavorable review of the film, and the “comic elite” in America is calling creator and star Sacha Baron Cohen a “revolutionary” (Stein, Rottenberg). Still, despite the positive reception from critics, Borat has caused worldwide controversy as well, which made me wonder: what is it exactly that separates those who hate the movie from those who love it? Is it just that people who hate it don’t “get it”?\r\n\r\nCohen, due to his performance as Borat, has been compared to Andy Kaufman, called a “Johnny Knoxville with a sense of humor,” and a Dadaist (Stein, Rottenberg). His performance blurs the line between the “wildly surreal and the all-too-real” as he allows his subjects no “comforting recourse to ironic detachment” (Rottenberg). It is reported that during filming, Cohen was extremely dedicated to the project, refusing to break character between the time he woke up and the time he went to bed. The mustache is real, the suit remained unwashed to make him smell more “foreign,” and all promotional interviews were conducted with Cohen in character (Rottenberg). This kind of ultra-real comedy, in which unwitting targets do not realize they are part of the joke, is, according to those in the know, a trend emerging with the release of <em>Borat</em>. Referred to as “street comedy,” it relies on extreme absurdity, well-placed realism (such as the authentically smelly suit), and little-to-no money (Stein). It is a descendent of <em>Jackass</em> and Stephen Colbert, but without the “twinkle in [the] eye” (Rottenberg). The look of <em>Borat</em>—the grainy, cheaply shot footage—is intentional, as is the fact that Borat hails from a real country. As British comedian David Baddiel points out, “if it had been an older comedian, Borat would have been from Stupidlandia” (Stein).\r\n\r\nIt is in the spirit of this new brand of guerrilla comedy that the faux documentary becomes so successful as a genre. <em>Borat</em> simply would not work as either a social commentary or a shock-filled comedy if a viewer felt that everyone on screen was in on the joke. The genuine reactions to Borat deliver most of the laughs, and it is knowing that these people are revealing their true selves, their innermost thoughts and beliefs, that allows the film to comment on American society and culture.\r\n\r\nWhen considering some of the most famously disgusting comedic outlets, such as<em>South Park, Team America: World Police</em>, and even <em>Mad</em> and <em>Cracked </em>magazines, it seems obvious that even if the public is sure to be disgusted, comedy just has to go as far as it can go. Comedians revel in the challenge to make audiences cringe. It is with this in mind that one considers how a group of the most respected comedians in America, following an advance viewing of Borat, shared a “sense of collective astonishment” (Rottenberg). In a group that included a <em>Simpsons</em> writer, Garry Shandling, and one of the creators of <em>Seinfeld</em> (the other, Larry Charles, actually directed <em>Borat</em>), there seemed to be a consensus that what they saw was “something totally original,” and that Cohen had changed comedy in the same way that Marlon Brando changed dramatic acting after <em>On the Waterfront</em> (Rottenberg, Stein).\r\n\r\nThis new style of aggressive comedy is expected to horrify older viewers, namely those over the age of 35. Says journalist Joel Stein, “If you’re over 35, you think you have the right to keep your regrettable moments private. If you’re under 35, you realize that everything is public now.” As one woman in the film tells Borat, when he asks her to clean him after using the toilet, “That is a very private thing.” But it isn’t anymore; nothing is. And the younger generations are used to that. In the era of reality television and Internet video stars, everyone’s idiocy and/or talent is on display for all to see. The notion of privacy as an assured right no longer exists, and everyone, at every moment, is at risk of revealing his or her true nature. The arrival and popularity of Colbert, YouTube and <em>Jackass</em> means the medium will continue to grow. No one is safe. At the Toronto Film Festival in September 2006, <em>Borat</em> “earned a rapturous reception,” even though the projector malfunctioned midway through the movie and despite the festival’s renown for debuting future Oscar contenders, which <em>Borat</em>reportedly outshone (Rottenberg). The movie has also created a lot of buzz on college campuses, as well as within the film industry. So it may be safe to assume that this type of movie, a colorful mix of vulgarity and supposed social commentary, is inevitably going to be more fervently anticipated, and finally received, by those Americans who are presumably more liberal, more open-minded, and more creative. Or is it just that this was the right time for this movie to be seen in America?\r\n\r\nProfessor Paul Lewis suggests in his critique of the film that the latter may be the case, and the movie’s reception internationally suggests it may be an entirely cultural issue. Borat has definitely not been so welcome in Russia, or in his supposed homeland of Kazakhstan. The former has not banned the movie, as was reported, but its Federal Culture and Cinematography Agency, which is responsible for certifying films for distribution, has refused to certify <em>Borat</em> (Myers). The agency contends that its decision was based on “potential to offend religious and ethnic feelings,” although due to rampant illegal DVD production in Russia the film will likely still be seen (Myers). This implies that there may still be some demand for the movie despite belief by officials that it will offend many within the country, particularly Russia’s large Muslim population.\r\n\r\n<em>Borat</em> is the first movie that has been refused certification for distribution in Russia since the collapse of Soviet censorship in the 1980’s (Myers). Even Kazakhstan has not explicitly refused distribution of the movie. This leads one to wonder whether Russia’s choice to refuse distribution for Borat is based on cultural, ethical, and religious reasons, or something else entirely. Daniil B. Dondurei, editor of <em>The Russian Art of Cinema</em> magazine, argues that the decision was motivated by politics. He cites “ethnic tensions, but also close relations between Russian and Kazakhstan, and a taboo in Russia against satirical depictions of national leaders or political systems”—a notable cultural difference from America, where leaders and politics are not only satirized publicly but frequently, on two intensely popular shows,<em> The Daily Show</em> and <em>The Colbert Report</em> (Myers).\r\n\r\nIn Kazakhstan, where they were likely expecting a “major, if probably hysterical, hit to [their] image,” the government went on the defensive in the wake of the release of<em>Borat</em>, taking out a four-page tourism advertisement in the <em>New York Times</em> and the<em>International Herald Tribune</em>, and producing television ads for distribution in America (EP Staff). The print ad, described by journalist Josh Rottenberg as “unintentionally funny,” tries to appeal to potential visitors with such tidbits as, “The country is home to the world’s largest population of wolves” (Rottenberg). Initially, the government of Kazakhstan threatened legal action against Cohen but has now invited him to visit. Cohen is considering going to Kazakhstan (in character, of course), and sees it as the “ultimate opportunity to conflate his made-up character with reality” (Stein).\r\n\r\nSo, Russia does not find Borat funny; Kazakhstan does not find Borat funny (although they are beginning to adopt the adage “If you can’t beat ’em…”); and Jordan, Kuwait, Barhain, Oman, and Qatar, all of which have “barred distribution of the film” due to predominantly Muslim populations, do not find Borat funny (Myers). Then why does America seem to find him so funny?\r\n\r\nThe answer to this question appears to lie in an interesting cultural conglomeration: Borat, both the movie and the man, embodies everything that Americans find humorous. He is a combination of highbrow satire, lowbrow sight gags, extreme and inaccurate caricature—he creates in the average viewer, through his own inadequacies, a quiet feeling of superiority. This recipe has proven successful in so many of America’s most popular comedic outlets: The Simpsons most notably; network sitcoms like the 1980s hit <em>Perfect Strange</em>, which capitalized on the inherent humor of a foreigner trying to start a life in America; even <em>The Daily Show</em>, which earned its extreme popularity by emphasizing for a delighted audience the constant foibles of politicians and other public figures.\r\n\r\nAmerica, it seems, has a history of humor based on “patronization of the other,” satire based upon stereotypes beginning with the caricature of Yankee Doodle during the American Revolution (Stein). Yankee Doodle was depicted as a country “bumpkin,” the opposite of the perception of the British as fancy and sophisticated, and was originally created as an “ignorant clodhopper [to] appeal to the British soldiery as an apt caricature of the rustic rebels” (Songs and Oaths, Tandy). Eventually, the character of Yankee Doodle was proudly adopted by American soldiers to emphasize and proclaim their difference and independence from the British (Songs and Oaths). These exaggerated characters generally develop into recognized facsimiles of a given ethnic or economic group, as Yankee Doodle came to symbolize patriotic Americans, and are then embraced in the culture. Such is Borat.\r\n\r\nOne trick, Rottenberg argues, that makes Borat (and Cohen) so successful is that he is playing on the average American’s inherent notion of a “foreigner,” and their almost guaranteed lack of geographical knowledge (Rottenberg). Cohen, Rottenberg says, capitalizes on the average American’s willingness to believe even “the most absurd things” about how people live and behave in foreign countries. Because Kazakhstan represents one of the “many gaping holes in the average American’s shaky knowledge of geography,” anything that Borat says about the country will go unchallenged by his subjects (Rottenberg). As Stein says, Cohen preys on the “fear, fascination and, most of all, patronization of the other –the foreigner” (Stein). The irony is that while Cohen plays the “clueless, desperate-to-fit-in, optimistic foreigner” that has become a comedy staple, Borat’s “attempts to be American pinpoint exactly how the world sees us: garish, violent, nouveau riche, a land of Donald Trumps and 50 Cents” (Stein).\r\n\r\nAn interesting contradiction lies in Cohen’s performance in the film. He simultaneously plays a “leering, filthy, poor and opinionated foreigner and a confidence man who triumphs over the shills who fall into his lap,” creating a caricature of a foreigner, and emphasizing the true feelings of his subjects (Lewis). Borat’s success lies in the audience’s knowledge that he may be fake, but the targets are very real. This duality allows the audience to laugh both at him and with him, and seamlessly combines the film’s use of both exaggeration (satire) and reality (documentary).\r\n\r\nAccording to journalist Carina Chocano, Borat’s encounters with average Americans are “gems of fish-out-of-water buffoonery” and test some “surprisingly ambitious sociological theories.” But to what end? Borat’s main target appears to be bigotry within the United States, particularly in the South. Lewis claims that audiences, by assuming a position of “imagined superiority” over both Borat and his subjects, “take an angry pleasure in the appalling statements he brings out of others” (Lewis). By revealing these people’s darker sides, Borat is giving the viewer a “shot of security and a double infusion of enhanced self-esteem” (Lewis). Viewers are given some sense of pride and the idea that things could be worse: they could be the person on-screen, saying bigoted things and making a fool of him/herself.\r\n\r\nAlso, the indiscretions of the people on the screen become a novelty in our contemporary politically correct society. As Jay Roach, director of <em>Austin Powers</em>, says, “Political correctness has led to a more civil society because people with racist attitudes have taken them underground” (Rottenberg). Until now! Borat reveals the true feelings of his subjects, much to the horror of the audience. But there is something compelling about hearing beliefs and ideas that are normally not allowed in a public forum. Particularly because it is socially unacceptable to publicly reveal one’s prejudices and hostilities, <em>Borat</em> quickly becomes both a window and a mirror, allowing people who do not share the opinions of those featured in the movie to see what others really think, and to allow those who do share these beliefs to see themselves represented in popular culture for better or worse. This onscreen candor creates something akin to a car crash: even if people hate what they are seeing, they can’t turn away. Of course, the fact that Cohen’s antics as Borat create humor within the spectacle makes it palatable to a wider audience, horrifying viewers some of the time, and making them laugh the rest of the time.\r\n\r\nSatire as a form of humor is pervasive throughout American comedy, and is seen as a highbrow alternative to parody or irony, intended to “attack vice, and promote virtue” (Granger). Tony Hendra defines satire as an “intellectual judo, in which the writer or performer takes on the ideas and character of his target and then takes both to absurd lengths to destroy them” (Turner 55). Throughout his travels, Cohen (as Borat) challenges his subjects, creating situations in which they can either receive him well, or not. Take, for example, the men on a New York subway that Borat attempts to greet with kisses. There is nothing overly aggressive or intrusive in the way in which Borat approaches the men; he only tries to kiss them on each cheek, in a way that is common in many European countries. More often than not, he is met with harsh language and the threat of bodily harm. This simple experiment reveals much about these men: homophobia, ignorance regarding other cultures, distrust, disassociation from the people around them, and probably even fear. The movie is full of similar incidents and similar people, all of which are startling in their hostility. Because the events on the screen are shocking and uncomfortable for the viewer, it becomes both natural and necessary to laugh to alleviate the uneasiness. Also, given the prevalence within American society of the traits exhibited by the men on the subway, the men become instantly recognizable to the audience, who “laugh along because [they] see [them]selves…and to face up to this sort of unvarnished, unpleasant reality is a powerfully subversive thing” (Turner 56). Unexpectedly, these men become representative of everything that is wrong with our society, and it becomes not only acceptable but obligatory to find the humor in their ignorance. How could we not? Suddenly we are aware that it is all around us, all the time!\r\n\r\nIn his book <em>Planet Simpson: How a Cartoon Masterpiece Defined a Generation</em>, Chris Turner notes that satire often emphasizes the “blazing hundred-foot-high neon gap between What Is and What Should Be,” or the difference between how people know things to be and how they want them to be (57). He explains further, saying that this idea is particularly important in comedy in America because “America’s ideals are so central to its society and so celebrated in its history and culture” (Turner 58). America prides itself on being welcoming, open-minded, and accepting. But Borat’s experience certainly does not confirm this notion. In actuality, the people that he meets are the exact opposite. This is usually so, says Louis D. Rubin Jr., who asserts that American comedy arises out of a gap between a “cultural ideal” and fact, with the ideal usually being revealed as “somewhat hollow and hypocritical, and the fact crude and disgusting” (Turner 58).\r\n\r\nIn addition to the more subtle comic devices Borat uses to get a laugh, there are present in the movie displays of all levels of comedy, described by Turner: sight gags, catchphrases, referential humor, and sophomoric humor—the previously mentioned bodily functions (Turner 59). Through the use of many levels of comedy, Borat is able to appeal to all types of viewers, and the movie never feels heavy with pretension, or like one would have to be a genius to understand the jokes. A child could watch the film and laugh. The sight gags and slapstick humor combined with the more subtle social satire create comedic stimulation for all the senses. The catchphrases (“High five!”) act as both an effective marketing tool and an easy way for people leaving the theatre to feel that they can actively participate in the movie. Just because the show is over does not mean you have to stop talking like Borat!\r\n\r\nThe referential humor in <em>Borat</em>—though limited—creates cultural cohesion, another potential reason that the film has been so successful in the very home of its main cultural reference: <em>Baywatch</em>. The references to the culture in Kazakhstan are quite obviously the fruits of Cohen’s imagination and are, for the most part, unspoken. Borat’s history and habits are never explicitly tied to Kazakhstan specifically, but instead embody most Americans’ notion of a foreigner. The choice of Kazakhstan as Borat’s home is effective because it “blends into all the other ‘stans’ we don’t understand” (Lewis). But the American people and references are real. As Cohen himself says, “The joke is not on Kazakhstan. I think the joke is on people who can believe that the Kazakhstan that I describe can exist” (Strauss). It is America that is<em>Borat</em>’s punch line, and it was also American audiences who turned test screenings into “tent revivals, with audiences convulsing with laughter” (Rottenberg).\r\n\r\nSo is it that <em>Borat </em>just happened to be the right movie at the right time in America? Can timing, and America’s general taste for vulgarity and satire, account for the movie’s phenomenal success here? Paul Lewis calls <em>Borat</em> the “perfect ethnic joke for post-9/11 America” (Lewis), capitalizing on America’s fear of foreigners as potential terrorists and turning it into laughter and fascination at the foibles of a naive newcomer. It is probably true that, before 9/11 and the country’s increased fears of terrorism, Borat would not have received the hostile reaction he did from the people he met throughout his journey. And, without their prejudice caught on tape, the film would not be the shocking glimpse into American intolerance it has become. It is for this fact in particular that <em>Borat </em>becomes such a fascinating lesson in American self-awareness. It reveals much about the American character, and says much about the way that America is viewed by foreigners (of which Cohen is one), but has still been embraced by the very people that it criticizes. Despite the unfortunate truths that may be revealed through the Borat movie, America must always be commended for its ability to laugh at itself, loudly and enthusiastically.', 'What''s So Funny: Comedy in America', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'whats-so-funny-comedy-in-america', '', '', '2012-03-23 16:01:07', '2012-03-23 16:01:07', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=284', 0, 'essay', '', 0),

(285, 5, '2011-12-19 07:57:34', '2011-12-19 07:57:34', 'During their recent confirmation hearings, Supreme Court Justices John Roberts and Samuel Alito both spoke about the importance of precedent in judicial decision making. In this age of bitter partisan politics, the High Court is often viewed as the one branch of government that interprets the law and leaves politics aside. In theory, Justices serve life terms so that they are not subject to the whims of the public. Nonetheless, despite the aura of non-partisanship the Court displays, it can be said that the Justices manipulate precedent to effectively rule based on their personal policy preferences.\r\n\r\nIn 1996, two political scientists, Jeffrey A. Segal and Harold J. Spaeth, did a statistical study of dissenting Justices in landmark decisions to determine whether or not Justices are influenced by precedent. They look at dissenting Justices because their revealed choices are clearly different from the Court’s decision, which makes it possible to see whether or not they change their opinions to comply with precedent in the future. Thus, “For each dissenting Justice, we will determine whether that Justice accepts the relevant decision in subsequent cases dealing with the same issue” (Segal 476). Certainly precedent does affect some decisions, but “the question is whether such behavior exists at systematic and substantively meaningful levels” (Segal 477).\r\n\r\nOf the 346 votes Siegel and Spaeth analyzed, “90.8% of the votes conform to the Justices revealed preferences. That is, only 9.2% of the time did a Justice switch to the position established in the landmark precedent” (477). All Justices but Justice Stewart and Justice Powell voted more than 80% of the time according to their own policy preferences. Half of Justice Stewart’s six precedential votes were from one case, and all five of Justice Powell’s were from one case. The empirical results show that following <em>stare decisis</em>, otherwise known as precedent, is the exception.\r\n\r\nYet while the evidence may indicate that following <em>stare decisis</em> is rare, Justices often preach about its importance. During their confirmations hearings, both Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito said they felt deep respect for precedent. Furthermore, Justice O’Connor preached for the preservation of precedent in her decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. That case revisited Roe v. Wade, which gave women the right to an abortion and was perhaps the most famous and controversial court case in our nation’s history. At the time, both Planned Parenthood and President Bush’s solicitor general, Kenneth Star, asked the Supreme Court to end the uncertainty and either reverse or affirm Roe v. Wade. In the end, Justice Kennedy and Justice Souter signed onto Justice O’Connor’s compromise opinion, which became the official opinion of the Court.\r\n\r\nJustice O’Connor’s decision focuses on the need to abide by <em>stare decisis</em> for the sake of the Court’s legitimacy. She says, “Thus, the Court’s legitimacy depends on making legally principled decisions under circumstances in which their principled character is sufficiently plausible to be accepted by the nation” (O’Connor III). O’Connor argues that if Justices made decisions on non-legal principles, the nation would begin to lose respect for the Court. Therefore, she claims, “Within the bounds of normal <em>stare decisis</em> analysis, then, and subject to the considerations on which it customarily turns, the stronger argument is for affirming Roe’s central holding, with whatever degree of personal reluctance any of us may have, not for overruling it” (O’Connor I). <em>stare decisis</em> must be upheld even when Justices disagree with it.\r\n\r\nJustice Scalia, however, rejects the Court’s reliance upon <em>stare decisis</em> as contrived: “It insists upon the necessity of adhering not to all of Roe, but only to what it calls the ‘central holding’” (Scalia). It appears that this picking and choosing of what part of the precedent the Court will follow is simply a way for the Justices to keep the parts of Roe v. Wade with which they agree, while leaving out those that they view as poor policy. To show how the court has done this, Justice Scalia focuses on the trimester framework, a part of Roe v. Wade that the Court rejects in Planned Parenthood v. Casey:\r\n\r\nI must confess, however, that I have always thought, and I think a lot of other people have always thought, that the arbitrary trimester framework, which the Court today discards, was quite as central to Roe as the arbitrary viability test, which the Court today retains. It seems particularly ungrateful to carve the trimester framework out of the core of Roe, since its very rigidity (in sharp contrast to the utter indeterminability of the “undue burden” test) is probably the only reason the Court is able to say, in urging <em>stare decisis</em>, that Roe “has in no sense proven ‘unworkable,’” ante, at 13. I suppose the Court is entitled to call a “central holding” whatever it wants to call a “central holding”—which is, come to think of it, perhaps one of the difficulties with this modified version of <em>stare decisis</em>. (Scalia)\r\n\r\nJustice Scalia then describes a number of different ways in which the majority decision ignores large portions of Roe. He essentially argues that the majority opinion, while claiming to uphold Roe based on precedent, essentially destroys the whole institution of <em>stare decisis</em> with its inconsistent holdings.\r\n\r\nJustice O’Connor does believe that a certain amount of “correction of error” is permissible. Yet “only the most convincing justification under accepted standards of precedent could suffice to demonstrate that a later decision overruling the first was anything but surrender to political pressure, and an unjustified repudiation of the principle which the Court staked its authority in the first place” (Scalia). While O’Connor upholds Roe, she does change certain aspects of it, such as the trimester framework, which essentially rules out any restrictions on abortion through the first two trimesters. She says, “We reject the trimester framework, which we do not consider to be part of the essential essence of Roe” (O’Connor IV). In its place, O’Connor introduces the “undue burden” standard for determining whether an abortion-related law is constitutional.\r\n\r\nSo if Justices do not follow <em>stare decisis</em>, why then do they preach of its importance? What, then, is the relationship between precedent and decision making? In effect, Justices use the appearance of <em>stare decisis</em> to cover their own policy beliefs and gain legitimacy. For example, in his dissent in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, Justice Scalia rips into Justice O’Connor’s “outrageous arguments…which it is beyond human nature to leave unanswered” (Scalia). Responding to O’Connor’s opening statement, “Liberty finds no refuge in a jurisprudence of doubt” (O’Connor I), Scalia claims that “The shortcomings of Roe did not include lack of clarity” (Scalia). Instead, Scalia claims, the new undue burden test’s “efforts at clarification make clear only that the standard is manipulatible and will prove hopelessly unworkable in practice.… Consciously or not, the joint opinion’s verbal game will conceal raw judicial policy choice concerning what is ‘appropriate’ abortion legislation” (Scalia).\r\n\r\nIn essence, Scalia argues that Justice O’Connor’s majority opinion, which is, by extension, the majority opinion of the Court, conforms far more to the Justices’ own personal preferences than it does to Roe v. Wade. As Justice Scalia points out, even though Justice O’Connor claims to uphold the “essential holding” of Roe v. Wade, she conforms more to her own personal preferences in Planned Parenthood v. Casey far more than she does to the prior case. For example, O’Connor’s dissent in Akron I, while she was sitting on a lower court, first introduced the idea of an “undue burden,” which she sets forth as the new test for admissibility in place of the trimester framework of Roe. In effect, she has masked her own policy preference on abortion with the image of <em>stare decisis</em>. While she claims to accept the central holding of Roe, she rejects large parts of it in order to replace the trimester framework with her own favored standard. This manipulation of Roe allowed Justice O’Connor to come up with the split decision on Casey, upholding the informed consent, 24-hour waiting period, and parental consent portions of the law in question while striking down the spousal notification and reporting sections of that law. As Justice Scalia notes, “Under Roe, requiring a 24-hour waiting period between the time the woman gives her informed consent and the time of the abortion is unconstitutional, Akron I. Under the “undue burden” regime (as applied today, at least) it is not” (Scalia). Through his scathing dissent, Justice Scalia has shown us perhaps the greatest illusion in American politics. Justices do not follow precedent; they manipulate it to gain legitimacy for their policy preferences. Segal and Spaeth have proven Justice Scalia right: “The Imperial Judiciary lives” (Scalia).', 'Justice''s Illusion', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'justices-illusion', '', '', '2012-03-23 15:23:12', '2012-03-23 15:23:12', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=285', 0, 'essay', '', 0),

It seems particularly ungrateful to carve the trimester framework out of the core of Roe, since its very rigidity (in sharp contrast to the utter indeterminability of the “undue burden” test) is probably the only reason the Court is able to say, in urging <em>stare decisis</em>, that Roe “has in no sense proven ‘unworkable,’” ante, at 13. I suppose the Court is entitled to call a “central holding” whatever it wants to call a “central holding”—which is, come to think of it, perhaps one of the difficulties with this modified version of <em>stare decisis</em>. (Scalia)\r\n\r\nJustice Scalia then describes a number of different ways in which the majority decision ignores large portions of Roe. He essentially argues that the majority opinion, while claiming to uphold Roe based on precedent, essentially destroys the whole institution of <em>stare decisis</em> with its inconsistent holdings.\r\n\r\nJustice O’Connor does believe that a certain amount of “correction of error” is permissible. Yet “only the most convincing justification under accepted standards of precedent could suffice to demonstrate that a later decision overruling the first was anything but surrender to political pressure, and an unjustified repudiation of the principle which the Court staked its authority in the first place” (Scalia). While O’Connor upholds Roe, she does change certain aspects of it, such as the trimester framework, which essentially rules out any restrictions on abortion through the first two trimesters. She says, “We reject the trimester framework, which we do not consider to be part of the essential essence of Roe” (O’Connor IV). In its place, O’Connor introduces the “undue burden” standard for determining whether an abortion-related law is constitutional.\r\n\r\nSo if Justices do not follow <em>stare decisis</em>, why then do they preach of its importance? What, then, is the relationship between precedent and decision making? In effect, Justices use the appearance of <em>stare decisis</em> to cover their own policy beliefs and gain legitimacy. For example, in his dissent in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, Justice Scalia rips into Justice O’Connor’s “outrageous arguments…which it is beyond human nature to leave unanswered” (Scalia). Responding to O’Connor’s opening statement, “Liberty finds no refuge in a jurisprudence of doubt” (O’Connor I), Scalia claims that “The shortcomings of Roe did not include lack of clarity” (Scalia). Instead, Scalia claims, the new undue burden test’s “efforts at clarification make clear only that the standard is manipulatible and will prove hopelessly unworkable in practice.… Consciously or not, the joint opinion’s verbal game will conceal raw judicial policy choice concerning what is ‘appropriate’ abortion legislation” (Scalia).\r\n\r\nIn essence, Scalia argues that Justice O’Connor’s majority opinion, which is, by extension, the majority opinion of the Court, conforms far more to the Justices’ own personal preferences than it does to Roe v. Wade. As Justice Scalia points out, even though Justice O’Connor claims to uphold the “essential holding” of Roe v. Wade, she conforms more to her own personal preferences in Planned Parenthood v. Casey far more than she does to the prior case. For example, O’Connor’s dissent in Akron I, while she was sitting on a lower court, first introduced the idea of an “undue burden,” which she sets forth as the new test for admissibility in place of the trimester framework of Roe. In effect, she has masked her own policy preference on abortion with the image of <em>stare decisis</em>. While she claims to accept the central holding of Roe, she rejects large parts of it in order to replace the trimester framework with her own favored standard. This manipulation of Roe allowed Justice O’Connor to come up with the split decision on Casey, upholding the informed consent, 24-hour waiting period, and parental consent portions of the law in question while striking down the spousal notification and reporting sections of that law. As Justice Scalia notes, “Under Roe, requiring a 24-hour waiting period between the time the woman gives her informed consent and the time of the abortion is unconstitutional, Akron I. Under the “undue burden” regime (as applied today, at least) it is not” (Scalia). Through his scathing dissent, Justice Scalia has shown us perhaps the greatest illusion in American politics. Justices do not follow precedent; they manipulate it to gain legitimacy for their policy preferences. Segal and Spaeth have proven Justice Scalia right: “The Imperial Judiciary lives” (Scalia).', 'Justice''s Illusion', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '285-autosave', '', '', '2012-02-27 07:49:13', '2012-02-27 07:49:13', '', 285, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?p=411', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
(286, 5, '2011-12-19 07:58:14', '2011-12-19 07:58:14', 'On September 11, 2001, I was in math class, learning about polynomials. At approximately 9:30am, a student foreign to the class walked in and informed us that there was a national emergency and that a school meeting was to be held right at that moment. My teacher, an elderly man with large rectangular glasses, glared at the messenger and quickly announced that the rest of us were to stay in our seats until he finished his lecture. We were late for the meeting. Following the meeting and the infamous announcement, we spent the rest of the day with our eyes glued to the television, soaking in the latest information, watching the towers fall, over and over again. I had never been to New York City, so the images were just that: images. It was no different than watching Independence Day or Terminator II. The next day, we returned to our normal lives, to classes and books and sports and all of the other elements of boarding school life. I did not even call my mother. Certainly, the images of 9/11 were and remain highly disturbing, and I felt, along with the rest of the country, a mix of shock, horror, sadness, and sympathy for the victims. Yet life continued, and 9/11 became little more than a bad dream, a separate reality that did not require my participation or my commitment. Reactions such as mine to 9/11 have occasioned much thought among American critics. Leading intellectual Susan Sontag appraises this all too common phenomenon while postmodernist theorist Stanley Fish proposes a discourse within which we might analyze the effects of 9/11 and the war on terror.\r\n\r\nIn her essay, “Looking at War: Photography’s view of devastation and death,” Susan Sontag examines the effect of images of destruction upon non-combatants (in particular, the prosperous West), and argues against the use of images to interpret war. Images, she states, are too superficial and too easily altered: “Photographs of victims of war are themselves a species of rhetoric. They reiterate. They simplify. They agitate. They create the illusion of consensus” (Sontag 83). Though she criticizes the use of images, particularly in the media, Sontag also clearly discards the conservative view that horrible images desensitize, that “flooded with images of the sort that once used to shock and arouse indignation, we are losing our capacity to react” (97). If this is true, Sontag says, then the only solution is to limit the number of terrible images shown to the public, an answer that is both impractical and unethical. After all, she writes, “The horrors themselves are not going to abate” (Sontag 97). However, while she criticizes the conservative view of media, Sontag also turns against the liberal left’s argument that “public attention is steered by the attentions of the media…when there are photographs, the war becomes ‘real’” (96). She pays special attention to the French: “This view is associated in particular with the writings of the late Guy Debord…and of Jean Beaudrillard, who claims…that images, simulated realities, are all that exists now; it seems to be something of a French specialty” (Sontag 97). Carefully avoiding the word “postmodern,” Sontag vigorously condemns the “French day-trippers,” as well as the rest of the liberal intellectuals, for viewing horror without acting upon it. Having cast off the conservative and liberal views of the function of images of warfare, Sontag takes an alternate path. She believes that the “antidote to the perennial seductiveness of war” is “active mobilization,” and that “a narrative seems likely to be more effective than an image” (Sontag 97-98). Ultimately, she implies that the sympathy we feel when we listen to narratives necessitates a commitment, to take action either for or against the conflict. In the case of 9/11, surely this would mean an intervention, and the intervention the United States has committed to, the highly debated war on terror, is undoubtedly a decisive action.\r\n\r\nWhile Sontag argues against the simplification of warfare into simple images, Stanley Fish argues against the use of simple words as justification for war (particularly the war on terror) in his essays “Postmodern Warfare: the ignorance of our warrior intellectuals” and “Condemnation Without Absolutes.” One of the immediate effects of 9/11 was the serious questioning of the tenants of postmodernism; several commentators, including Edward Rothstein, Julia Keller, and Roger Rosenblatt, complained that by denying the existence of objective truth, postmodernists “have weakened the country’s resolve…[leaving] us with no firm basis for either condemning the terrorist attacks or fighting back” (Fish “Condemnation Without Absolutes”). Fish’s answer to such criticism is simple: the critics have misinterpreted postmodernism, and indeed, “postmodernists say no such thing” (Fish “Postmodern Warfare”). According to Fish, postmodernism does not prohibit a decisive response to the events of 9/11; rather, it merely demands that such a response cannot be based on “a sense of right and wrong that no one would dispute and everyone accepts…[because] there are not such universally accepted values” (Fish “Postmodern Warfare”). Having established his defense of postmodernism, the usually controversial Fish readily takes a less radical tone, stating, “At times like these, the nation rightly falls back on the record of aspiration and accomplishment that makes up our collective understanding of what we live for” (“Condemnation Without Absolutes”). However, Fish maintains his argument against absolutes of language, what Edward Said calls “false universals.” According to Fish, “they stand in the way of useful thinking…If we reduce the enemy to ‘evil,’ we conjure up…a wild-card moral anarchist beyond our comprehension and therefore beyond the reach of any counterstrategies” (“Condemnation Without Absolutes”). Fish’s solution lies in the postmodernist theory of cultural relativism; we must put ourselves in our enemies’ shoes, “not in order to wear them as [our] own but…to have some understanding (far short of approval) of why someone else might want to wear them” (“Condemnation Without Absolutes”).\r\n\r\nAs one of postmodernism’s leading literary theorists, Stanley Fish would indubitably fall into Sontag’s category of the “French”, the liberal left who “see war as a spectacle” (Sontag 97). Certainly, Fish, a pioneer of post-structuralist literary theory, is preoccupied with words, not actions. In a typically postmodernist fashion, Fish dissects the language of his critics, particularly Rothstein’s use of the words “objective” and “reliable.” Indeed, by arguing that it is useless to justify actions with abstract words because there are no universal absolutes, Fish turns words into phantoms, language into a shadowy, ungraspable structure. He effectively impels the reader to participate in a purely postmodern practice: talking about how to talk about war. Even after posing the question, “What to do?” Fish remains as far removed from action as possible:\r\n<blockquote> You assert that your universal is the true one, even though your adversaries clearly do not accept it, and you do not attribute their recalcitrance to insanity or mere criminality…but to the fact…that they are in the grip of a set of beliefs that is false. And there you have to leave it, because the next step, the step of proving the falseness of their beliefs to everyone…is not a step available to us as finite situated human beings. (“Postmodern Warfare”)</blockquote>\r\nIt is unclear how Fish’s brand of theoretical practice can actually lead to any kind of real action (especially considering the global scope of war), and Sontag in particular would condemn Fish’s passive discourse. For Sontag, pacifism is a moral failure.\r\n\r\nHowever, Stanley Fish’s analysis of words and insistence on avoiding simple and abstract concepts can easily be turned around to criticize Susan Sontag. When Sontag suggests that the sympathy one feels in reaction to war narrative is contingent upon ethical commitment, she uses surprisingly hedging language: “Could one be mobilized actively to oppose war by an image, as one might [by a narrative]…Partly it is a question of the length of time one is obliged to look, and to feel” (98). By using the word “one,” rather than “we” or “I,” Sontag distances herself from her argument, making broad statements that do not require her involvement as she argues for personal engagement. Fish would likely urge Sontag to take her own advice and commit to her language. Sontag’s final argument, that sympathy necessitates commitment, is surely a claim with which Fish would disagree; for him, there is no such thing as universal objectivity, and therefore, nothing is universally necessary or contingent upon something else. Ultimately, however, both writers urge their readers to see past simplistic statements, be they in language or photographs. Rather, they argue, when entering into a discourse on war, whether through images, narrative, events, or justifications, we need to maintain a rigorous engagement with ideas.\r\n\r\nThe question that remains, however, is whether or not sympathy necessitates commitment; why, in the aftermath of 9/11, can I so easily sit back and watch the spectacle, engaging with the war on terror only through passive, meandering discussion with the likes of Stanley Fish? Susan Sontag would argue that my exposure to photographs and television is the reason. She states, “Memory freeze-frames; its basic unit is the single image” (Sontag 87), and though they may be shocking and disturbing, memories engender no commitment. Since most of us saw only images of the falling towers on television screens, Sontag would argue, we do not truly appreciate how real the events of 9/11 were to the people who experienced them first-hand; “We don’t get it. We can’t truly imagine what it was like…Can’t understand, can’t imagine” (Sontag 98). As a solution, Sontag promotes narrative as a means through which we can feel the appropriate sympathy that will necessarily demand action.\r\n\r\nMy work-study job as an audit-editor for Columbia University’s Oral History Department’s 9/11 Project exposes me, almost daily, to the types of narratives Sontag advocates, the types of narratives that she states should necessitate an ethical commitment on my part. This however, has yet to occur. Conversely, I find that even among the survivors and witnesses of 9/11, commitment to or against the war on terror (the decisive action taken in response to the undoubtedly horrible event) is relatively uncommon. Interviews for the 9/11 Project were made up of two sessions: the first session occurred within the first few months of 9/11; the second took place approximately a year later. Though I am not legally allowed to quote from any of these interviews, the database will be functional and searchable within the year. Unsurprisingly, the immediate response to 9/11—that is, the response of the survivors when they began to comprehend what had happened—was confusion and indecision, the exact opposite of the decisive commitment that Sontag states is contingent upon perceiving horrible events. Of course, we can attribute this reaction to shock, but even during the second session, a year later, most survivors state that they have been able to continue with the rest of their lives, that 9/11’s effect upon them has lessened through time. Opinions on the war on terror are incredibly diverse: while some support it, others are decisively against it; still more remain either confused or apathetic. No one is necessarily, unavoidably moved towards a commitment or action, not the survivors nor those who witnessed the event first-hand.\r\n\r\nAs the memory of 9/11 fades, no matter how many photographs of dead soldiers, televised accounts of battles, or narratives from Iraq we are exposed to, commitment to the war on terror wanes as well. In her article, “Real Battles and Empty Metaphors,” Susan Sontag confirms 9/11 as a past event, a memory that, if we follow her argument in “Looking at War,” engenders no commitment. Sontag observes government’s attempts to keep the memory of 9/11 (and therefore the support for the war on terror) fresh and alive:\r\n<blockquote>Ceremonies…are viewed as part of the continuing affirmation of American solidarity against the enemy. The comparison between Sept.11, 2001, and Dec. 7, 1941, has never been far from the mind…However, I doubt that great commemorative ceremonies were felt to be needed to keep up morale and unite the country on Dec. 7, 1942. That was a real war, and one year later it was very much still going on. This is a phantom war and therefore in the need of an anniversary. ( “Real Battles and Empty Metaphors”)</blockquote>\r\nWhile Sontag attempts to explain poor attendance at 9/11 memorial services in the context of her proposal that the war on terror is not a real war, I heartily disagree with her reasoning. Sontag argues that the war on terror is a false war, a metaphorical campaign akin to wars on cancer, poverty, and drugs. “Real wars,” states Sontag, “are not metaphors. And real wars have a beginning and an end…This anti-terror war can never end” ( “Real Battles and Empty Metaphors”). While Sontag is accurate in her assessment of the war on terror, she admits, in her title, that the battles are real, and she can certainly not deny that real men and women, on both sides, are violently suffering and dying. As such, in accordance with her argument in “Looking At War,” proper exposure to the suffering inherent in the war on terror should still engender our sympathy and necessitate our commitment. Returning to Sontag’s example of poor attendance at 9/11 memorial ceremonies, I again disagree with Sontag’s interpretation. Unquestionably, the government uses these services to create the illusion of overwhelmingly popular support for the war on terror. While these services (as well as early interventions such as the war in Afghanistan) were popular immediately after 9/11, as time passed, people became skeptical of the commitment these types of ceremonies imply. This of course, does not mean that people have become any less sympathetic to the events of 9/11, are any less upset, angry, and saddened at the memory of the events. Rather, though still sympathetic, citizens have become less and less willing to commit to a war that is still killing hundreds, even thousands. Ultimately, in the face of reality, of the first-hand experience that she so strongly advocates, Sontag’s implication that sympathy absolutely necessitates commitment simply does not hold up.\r\n\r\nContrary to Susan Sontag’s argument, sympathy does not absolutely necessitate commitment; however, remaining a passive spectator like Fish does not seem particularly palatable either. Indeed, if the relationship between sympathy and ethical commitment is not necessity, then what is it? Fish, of course, would argue that there is no relationship that can be universally understood. However, even Fish states that we are bound to our ethics, even if our moral code is not universal. In fact, in “Postmodern Warfare,” he is careful to point out the legitimacy of ethics, arguing that it is possible to have ethical judgment and to assert moral truths, but we must also realize that these truths are impossible to prove and that our ethics are by no means universal. Fish writes, “Your belief or disbelief in postmodern tenets is independent of your beliefs and commitments in any other area of your life” ( “Postmodern Warfare”). Certainly, this curious statement raises a significant question: Where, then, do these beliefs and commitments come from? Fish volunteers a simple answer that is unusually devoid of postmodernist theory: “The actor…begins in some context of practice, with its received authorities, sacred texts, exemplary achievements, and generally accepted benchmarks, and from within the perspective of that context judges something to be true or inaccurate” (“Postmodern Warfare”). Certainly, ethics come from increasingly varied sources; ultimately, however, as Fish sensibly argues, they should always remain open to critical interpretation and collective debate among the community of action. However, once an ethical decision is reached, we must discard Fishian prevarication for Sontagian commitment. Though sympathy does not necessitate action, decisions are contingent upon commitment, and while it is all well and good to look sympathetically at war and fish passively for commitment, it is only by making decisions and following through with them that we can truly alter reality.', 'Looking at War, Fishing for Commitment', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'looking-at-war-fishing-for-commitment', '', '', '2012-03-23 15:27:20', '2012-03-23 15:27:20', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=286', 0, 'essay', '', 0),

Displayed on a raised white platform, each is honoured with its own pedestal. The group includes a version of his <em>Bird in Space</em> series, a slender, soaring sweep of polished metal; the<em> Endless Column</em> of octagonal forms in dark oak; <em>The Cock</em>—pointed, aggressively angular, also in wood; and <em>Mlle Pogany</em>, a bronze bust of a woman’s highly stylized countenance that retains only a pair of overarching brows tapering down into a thin tip of a nose, a brief, incised line where her mouth should be, and one solitary ear.\r\n\r\nSusan Sontag would have appreciated the portrait of Brancusi’s young Hungarian friend. Its surface, burnished to a high, glossy gleam, reflects the viewer back at him/herself—photographs of it nearly always include the photographer also—and, in so doing, emphasizes a semantic duality at play: the mirror-like sheen both reinforces the subject’s self-absorption, her inward gaze, as well as achieving a perfectly smooth, impenetrable exterior, thereby keeping at bay all would deconstruct it, crack its code, or, in Sontag’s words, “dig “behind” the text, to find a sub-text which is the true one” (Sontag 6). In her essay, “Against Interpretation,” Sontag attacks contemporary art criticism, which she views as both misguided and inadequate, for its tendency to “impoverish, to deplete the world­in order to set up a shadow world of “meanings” (7). She takes issue with how the relentless drive to interpret, to assign fixed meanings, has come to replace the direct, immediate sensory perception of any work of art, and a suitable appreciation of its aesthetic values, and the chief culprit, in her understanding of the term, is referred to as the “plucking (of) a set of elements (the X, the Y, the Z, and so forth) from the whole work” so that “X is really—or, really means—A” (Sontag 7, 5). This practice of equating one thing with another, an “idea that is now perpetuated in the guise of a certain way of encountering works of art thoroughly ingrained among most people who take any of the arts seriously”, is illustrated by the film version of Tennessee Williams’<em> A Streetcar Named Desire</em>, a bubbling cauldron of a drama of primal emotions, misrepresented by director Elia Kazan as depicting in microcosm “the decline of Western civilization” (Sontag 5, 9). In place of this proclivity to impose larger, universal meanings, Sontag argues for an approach that puts the focus squarely back where it belongs—form: “What is needed is a vocabulary—a descriptive, rather than prescriptive, vocabulary—for forms. The best criticism, and it is uncommon, is of this sort that dissolves considerations of content into those of form” (Sontag 12). The “highest, most liberating value in art,” she declares, is “transparency,” or what is otherwise referred to (very aptly) as “experiencing the luminousness of the thing in itself” (Sontag 13).\r\n\r\nThe sculptures in the MoMA are immediately recognizable as Brancusis. They are starkly and powerfully linear; they are almost wholly abstract representations devoid of any distinguishing biomorphic traits, and as such they lend themselves all too easily to the Sontag-ian exemplar of pure clarity and luminescence, unencumbered by distracting intimations of “content.” Arresting the eye by their sheer, insistent presence, they demand to be noticed, and their elemental configurations—most can be reduced to a few basic, fundamental shapes—and obdurately <em>material</em> surfaces seem to resist any sort of attempt to symbolize, to allegorize and to draw analogies, i.e. to interpret. As Rudolf Arnheim demonstrates in <em>Visual Thinking</em>, however, analysis, both visual and mental, begins with the mere act of looking; our ocular and cognitive faculties share a far closer relationship than is commonly assumed, and to see is, at the same time, to interpret. Human vision is a far from passive activity­it is by nature both “purposive and selective” (19):\r\n<blockquote>Through that world roams the glance, directed by attention, focusing the narrow range of sharpest vision now on this, now on that spot, following the flight of a distant sea gull, scanning a tree to explore its shape. It may refer to a small part of the visual world or to the whole visual framework of space, in which all presently seen objects have their location […] Some of its aspects build up fast, some slowly, and all of them are subject to continued confirmation, reappraisal, change, completion, correction, deepening of understanding. (14-5)</blockquote>\r\nThe “deepening of understanding” also involves the processing of information not always available to the faculties, and Arnheim adduces several examples of this phenomenon, one of which is that of our perception of shapes. He asserts that we do not see the actual shape of an object, but fit it, rather, into a pre-existing mental template to which it broadly conforms (termed visual concepts or categories), so that the moon, for instance, which can only be said to be round once a month, is seen as such when it is nearly so at other times. These visual categories also utilize the human penchant for metaphor: a dome might be “hemispherical” (though not quite exactly so), or a long, circular lampshade, “cylindrical.” A woman’s puffy, piled-up hairdo, for which an appropriate adjective is lacking, is called “cumulus-shaped.” Just as words for one object are employed in the service of another, so too does human understanding of the wider world consist fundamentally in the drawing of connections between one phenomenon and the next. We conceive of relationships or likenesses between the tangible and the intangible (“She stabbed me in the back”), for instance, or between people and things (“He’s such a blockhead”), or, to take Sontag’s terms, between X and A.\r\n\r\nWhat we conceive of, then, as the unbiased and non-judgmental faculty of perception is actually anything but: “there is, therefore, no difference in principle between percept and concept” (Arnheim 28). The blurring of the divide between objective and subjective ways of seeing was an impulse central to Brancusi’s work—it was the essence of a thing that he wished to capture (indeed, a retrospective of his work organized by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 2004 was titled “The Essence of Things”). <em>Fish</em>, an elongated, streamlined piece of grained marble, is a prime example of this reduction to sensory fundamentals, and Brancusi himself explained it thus: “When you see a fish you don’t think of its scales, do you? You think of its speed, its floating, flashing body seen through the water. Well, I’ve tried to express just that. If I made fins and eyes and scales, I would arrest its movement, give a pattern or shape of reality. I want just the flash of its spirit” (Jianou 14).\r\n\r\nArt critic and historian Rosalind Krauss, in her book <em>Passages in Modern Sculpture</em>, also offers an approach to Brancusi’s oeuvre that incorporates within its formalist methodology the possibility of readings on a more particular level. For Krauss, in fact, Brancusi’s works are unequivocally “objects,” possessed of “the beauty and severity of mechanically functional shapes”; these finished, polished products, shorn of any experiential reference—save the evocation of industrial design—invites the viewer to a “peculiar […] contemplation,” “a contemplation as unreceptive to analysis as the polished marble or bronze surfaces are to penetration” (100, 85-6). Form is of the essence here, but forms so uncompromisingly basic, so fiercely minimal, and so inimical to the interpretive act as to constitute a merciless denial of Sontag’s despised meanings, nevertheless, in the case of <em>Beginning of the World</em>, a Brancusi work of 1924, which Krauss dubs a “final reductive statement”, acquires a reckoning of its stringent formal qualities, understood in incongruously organic terms (Krauss 96).\r\n\r\nA tapered bronze teardrop, agleam with the characteristic Brancusi polish, it is placed in the center of a circular metal disk, on which its lower half casts a reflection, thereby being, at the same time, the recipient of its own image, reflected by the mirror of the disk’s surface, and swathed in its own shadow. By contrast, the upper half, turned toward the light (of the exhibition space), glimmers and glitters with the play of “myriad and changing visual incidents”, a constantly shifting kaleidoscope of reflected distortions that registers any and all changes in its immediate environment. It is precisely in this contrast of light and dark, movement and stasis, that Krauss locates the affective import of the piece: “It is this differential that gives to the geometry of the form something of a kinesthetic quality that recalls the feeling of the back of one’s head, resting heavily on a pillow, while the face floats, weightless and unencumbered, toward sleep” (Krauss 87).\r\n\r\n<em>Mlle Pogany </em>may be expressive of her creator’s predilection for the forceful, fluid line, but her features are, in comparison to<em> Beginning of the World</em>, or to her companions in the MoMA, atypically naturalistic. To do her any justice, to acknowledge her spirit and luminousness, is to describe her in terms of images of sufficient emotional weight. The ovoid head, bearing more than a passing trace of the simian, rests tranquilly on her hands in a gentle downward tilt—the latter are clasped together in the gesture of a supplicant or a daydreaming schoolgirl, and the effect is at once tender and wistful, and suggestive of repose, contemplation, quiet reverie. The mood is interrupted by her neck, a sleek, tubular column thrusting aside with all the rhythmic vigour of pertinacious plant growth, and which imparts to the entirety of the piece its hint of tension and arrested motion; the undercurrent of dissonance is furthered by her precarious perch on the small, square base, a tightrope walker’s delicate balancing act.\r\n\r\nConstantin Brancusi was said to have commented of his work: “I offer you pure joy.” And, indeed, he does. A Brancusi epitomizes Sontag’s formulation of “an erotics of art” (14). Sontag may insist upon a thing being only what it is and no more nor less, but she admits also the role that interpretation, as she understands it, plays in the full gamut of human experience: “Interpretation itself must be evaluated, within a historical view of human consciousness. In some cultural contexts, interpretation is a liberating act. It is a means of revising, of transvaluing, of escaping the dead past. In other cultural contexts, it is reactionary, impertinent, cowardly, stifling” (Sontag 7). Arnheim points the way to this unwarranted primacy of the interpretive urge by demonstrating that the dichotomy between perceiving and reasoning—which he attributes to the ancient Greek philosophers—is likewise the result of socio-historical forces, and not quite the natural function it has long been assumed to be. His implicit recognition of the various and varied reactions that any work of art produces, the consequence of complex human vision, is echoed by Krauss’ reading of Brancusi’s work, proceeding as it does from rigorous visual analysis to an affirmation of what are, ultimately, human values. Brancusi speaks to the viewer on multiple levels at once: he piques the curiousity, he stirs the heart; he excites the mind, he enchants the senses; he arouses that unique, particular emotion, that certain luminosity, which only aesthetic satisfaction affords us: joy.', 'Pure Joy', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'pure-joy', '', '', '2012-03-23 15:39:18', '2012-03-23 15:39:18', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=287', 0, 'essay', '', 0);

My teacher, an elderly man with large rectangular glasses, glared at the messenger and quickly announced that the rest of us were to stay in our seats until he finished his lecture. We were late for the meeting. Following the meeting and the infamous announcement, we spent the rest of the day with our eyes glued to the television, soaking in the latest information, watching the towers fall, over and over again. I had never been to New York City, so the images were just that: images. It was no different than watching Independence Day or Terminator II. The next day, we returned to our normal lives, to classes and books and sports and all of the other elements of boarding school life. I did not even call my mother. Certainly, the images of 9/11 were and remain highly disturbing, and I felt, along with the rest of the country, a mix of shock, horror, sadness, and sympathy for the victims. Yet life continued, and 9/11 became little more than a bad dream, a separate reality that did not require my participation or my commitment. Reactions such as mine to 9/11 have occasioned much thought among American critics. Leading intellectual Susan Sontag appraises this all too common phenomenon while postmodernist theorist Stanley Fish proposes a discourse within which we might analyze the effects of 9/11 and the war on terror.\r\n\r\nIn her essay, “Looking at War: Photography’s view of devastation and death,” Susan Sontag examines the effect of images of destruction upon non-combatants (in particular, the prosperous West), and argues against the use of images to interpret war. Images, she states, are too superficial and too easily altered: “Photographs of victims of war are themselves a species of rhetoric. They reiterate. They simplify. They agitate. They create the illusion of consensus” (Sontag 83). Though she criticizes the use of images, particularly in the media, Sontag also clearly discards the conservative view that horrible images desensitize, that “flooded with images of the sort that once used to shock and arouse indignation, we are losing our capacity to react” (97). If this is true, Sontag says, then the only solution is to limit the number of terrible images shown to the public, an answer that is both impractical and unethical. After all, she writes, “The horrors themselves are not going to abate” (Sontag 97). However, while she criticizes the conservative view of media, Sontag also turns against the liberal left’s argument that “public attention is steered by the attentions of the media…when there are photographs, the war becomes ‘real’” (96). She pays special attention to the French: “This view is associated in particular with the writings of the late Guy Debord…and of Jean Beaudrillard, who claims…that images, simulated realities, are all that exists now; it seems to be something of a French specialty” (Sontag 97). Carefully avoiding the word “postmodern,” Sontag vigorously condemns the “French day-trippers,” as well as the rest of the liberal intellectuals, for viewing horror without acting upon it. Having cast off the conservative and liberal views of the function of images of warfare, Sontag takes an alternate path. She believes that the “antidote to the perennial seductiveness of war” is “active mobilization,” and that “a narrative seems likely to be more effective than an image” (Sontag 97-98). Ultimately, she implies that the sympathy we feel when we listen to narratives necessitates a commitment, to take action either for or against the conflict. In the case of 9/11, surely this would mean an intervention, and the intervention the United States has committed to, the highly debated war on terror, is undoubtedly a decisive action.\r\n\r\nWhile Sontag argues against the simplification of warfare into simple images, Stanley Fish argues against the use of simple words as justification for war (particularly the war on terror) in his essays “Postmodern Warfare: the ignorance of our warrior intellectuals” and “Condemnation Without Absolutes.” One of the immediate effects of 9/11 was the serious questioning of the tenants of postmodernism; several commentators, including Edward Rothstein, Julia Keller, and Roger Rosenblatt, complained that by denying the existence of objective truth, postmodernists “have weakened the country’s resolve…[leaving] us with no firm basis for either condemning the terrorist attacks or fighting back” (Fish “Condemnation Without Absolutes”). Fish’s answer to such criticism is simple: the critics have misinterpreted postmodernism, and indeed, “postmodernists say no such thing” (Fish “Postmodern Warfare”). According to Fish, postmodernism does not prohibit a decisive response to the events of 9/11; rather, it merely demands that such a response cannot be based on “a sense of right and wrong that no one would dispute and everyone accepts…[because] there are not such universally accepted values” (Fish “Postmodern Warfare”). Having established his defense of postmodernism, the usually controversial Fish readily takes a less radical tone, stating, “At times like these, the nation rightly falls back on the record of aspiration and accomplishment that makes up our collective understanding of what we live for” (“Condemnation Without Absolutes”). However, Fish maintains his argument against absolutes of language, what Edward Said calls “false universals.” According to Fish, “they stand in the way of useful thinking…If we reduce the enemy to ‘evil,’ we conjure up…a wild-card moral anarchist beyond our comprehension and therefore beyond the reach of any counterstrategies” (“Condemnation Without Absolutes”). Fish’s solution lies in the postmodernist theory of cultural relativism; we must put ourselves in our enemies’ shoes, “not in order to wear them as [our] own but…to have some understanding (far short of approval) of why someone else might want to wear them” (“Condemnation Without Absolutes”).\r\n\r\nAs one of postmodernism’s leading literary theorists, Stanley Fish would indubitably fall into Sontag’s category of the “French”, the liberal left who “see war as a spectacle” (Sontag 97). Certainly, Fish, a pioneer of post-structuralist literary theory, is preoccupied with words, not actions. In a typically postmodernist fashion, Fish dissects the language of his critics, particularly Rothstein’s use of the words “objective” and “reliable.” Indeed, by arguing that it is useless to justify actions with abstract words because there are no universal absolutes, Fish turns words into phantoms, language into a shadowy, ungraspable structure. He effectively impels the reader to participate in a purely postmodern practice: talking about how to talk about war. Even after posing the question, “What to do?” Fish remains as far removed from action as possible:\r\n<blockquote> You assert that your universal is the true one, even though your adversaries clearly do not accept it, and you do not attribute their recalcitrance to insanity or mere criminality…but to the fact…that they are in the grip of a set of beliefs that is false. And there you have to leave it, because the next step, the step of proving the falseness of their beliefs to everyone…is not a step available to us as finite situated human beings. (“Postmodern Warfare”)</blockquote>\r\nIt is unclear how Fish’s brand of theoretical practice can actually lead to any kind of real action (especially considering the global scope of war), and Sontag in particular would condemn Fish’s passive discourse. For Sontag, pacifism is a moral failure.\r\n\r\nHowever, Stanley Fish’s analysis of words and insistence on avoiding simple and abstract concepts can easily be turned around to criticize Susan Sontag. When Sontag suggests that the sympathy one feels in reaction to war narrative is contingent upon ethical commitment, she uses surprisingly hedging language: “Could one be mobilized actively to oppose war by an image, as one might [by a narrative]…Partly it is a question of the length of time one is obliged to look, and to feel” (98). By using the word “one,” rather than “we” or “I,” Sontag distances herself from her argument, making broad statements that do not require her involvement as she argues for personal engagement. Fish would likely urge Sontag to take her own advice and commit to her language. Sontag’s final argument, that sympathy necessitates commitment, is surely a claim with which Fish would disagree; for him, there is no such thing as universal objectivity, and therefore, nothing is universally necessary or contingent upon something else. Ultimately, however, both writers urge their readers to see past simplistic statements, be they in language or photographs. Rather, they argue, when entering into a discourse on war, whether through images, narrative, events, or justifications, we need to maintain a rigorous engagement with ideas.\r\n\r\nThe question that remains, however, is whether or not sympathy necessitates commitment; why, in the aftermath of 9/11, can I so easily sit back and watch the spectacle, engaging with the war on terror only through passive, meandering discussion with the likes of Stanley Fish? Susan Sontag would argue that my exposure to photographs and television is the reason. She states, “Memory freeze-frames; its basic unit is the single image” (Sontag 87), and though they may be shocking and disturbing, memories engender no commitment. Since most of us saw only images of the falling towers on television screens, Sontag would argue, we do not truly appreciate how real the events of 9/11 were to the people who experienced them first-hand; “We don’t get it. We can’t truly imagine what it was like…Can’t understand, can’t imagine” (Sontag 98). As a solution, Sontag promotes narrative as a means through which we can feel the appropriate sympathy that will necessarily demand action.\r\n\r\nMy work-study job as an audit-editor for Columbia University’s Oral History Department’s 9/11 Project exposes me, almost daily, to the types of narratives Sontag advocates, the types of narratives that she states should necessitate an ethical commitment on my part. This however, has yet to occur. Conversely, I find that even among the survivors and witnesses of 9/11, commitment to or against the war on terror (the decisive action taken in response to the undoubtedly horrible event) is relatively uncommon. Interviews for the 9/11 Project were made up of two sessions: the first session occurred within the first few months of 9/11; the second took place approximately a year later. Though I am not legally allowed to quote from any of these interviews, the database will be functional and searchable within the year. Unsurprisingly, the immediate response to 9/11—that is, the response of the survivors when they began to comprehend what had happened—was confusion and indecision, the exact opposite of the decisive commitment that Sontag states is contingent upon perceiving horrible events. Of course, we can attribute this reaction to shock, but even during the second session, a year later, most survivors state that they have been able to continue with the rest of their lives, that 9/11’s effect upon them has lessened through time. Opinions on the war on terror are incredibly diverse: while some support it, others are decisively against it; still more remain either confused or apathetic. No one is necessarily, unavoidably moved towards a commitment or action, not the survivors nor those who witnessed the event first-hand.\r\n\r\nAs the memory of 9/11 fades, no matter how many photographs of dead soldiers, televised accounts of battles, or narratives from Iraq we are exposed to, commitment to the war on terror wanes as well. In her article, “Real Battles and Empty Metaphors,” Susan Sontag confirms 9/11 as a past event, a memory that, if we follow her argument in “Looking at War,” engenders no commitment. Sontag observes government’s attempts to keep the memory of 9/11 (and therefore the support for the war on terror) fresh and alive:\r\n<blockquote>Ceremonies…are viewed as part of the continuing affirmation of American solidarity against the enemy. The comparison between Sept.11, 2001, and Dec. 7, 1941, has never been far from the mind…However, I doubt that great commemorative ceremonies were felt to be needed to keep up morale and unite the country on Dec. 7, 1942. That was a real war, and one year later it was very much still going on. This is a phantom war and therefore in the need of an anniversary. ( “Real Battles and Empty Metaphors”)</blockquote>\r\nWhile Sontag attempts to explain poor attendance at 9/11 memorial services in the context of her proposal that the war on terror is not a real war, I heartily disagree with her reasoning. Sontag argues that the war on terror is a false war, a metaphorical campaign akin to wars on cancer, poverty, and drugs. “Real wars,” states Sontag, “are not metaphors. And real wars have a beginning and an end…This anti-terror war can never end” ( “Real Battles and Empty Metaphors”). While Sontag is accurate in her assessment of the war on terror, she admits, in her title, that the battles are real, and she can certainly not deny that real men and women, on both sides, are violently suffering and dying. As such, in accordance with her argument in “Looking At War,” proper exposure to the suffering inherent in the war on terror should still engender our sympathy and necessitate our commitment. Returning to Sontag’s example of poor attendance at 9/11 memorial ceremonies, I again disagree with Sontag’s interpretation. Unquestionably, the government uses these services to create the illusion of overwhelmingly popular support for the war on terror. While these services (as well as early interventions such as the war in Afghanistan) were popular immediately after 9/11, as time passed, people became skeptical of the commitment these types of ceremonies imply. This of course, does not mean that people have become any less sympathetic to the events of 9/11, are any less upset, angry, and saddened at the memory of the events. Rather, though still sympathetic, citizens have become less and less willing to commit to a war that is still killing hundreds, even thousands. Ultimately, in the face of reality, of the first-hand experience that she so strongly advocates, Sontag’s implication that sympathy absolutely necessitates commitment simply does not hold up.\r\n\r\nContrary to Susan Sontag’s argument, sympathy does not absolutely necessitate commitment; however, remaining a passive spectator like Fish does not seem particularly palatable either. Indeed, if the relationship between sympathy and ethical commitment is not necessity, then what is it? Fish, of course, would argue that there is no relationship that can be universally understood. However, even Fish states that we are bound to our ethics, even if our moral code is not universal. In fact, in “Postmodern Warfare,” he is careful to point out the legitimacy of ethics, arguing that it is possible to have ethical judgment and to assert moral truths, but we must also realize that these truths are impossible to prove and that our ethics are by no means universal. Fish writes, “Your belief or disbelief in postmodern tenets is independent of your beliefs and commitments in any other area of your life” ( “Postmodern Warfare”). Certainly, this curious statement raises a significant question: Where, then, do these beliefs and commitments come from? Fish volunteers a simple answer that is unusually devoid of postmodernist theory: “The actor…begins in some context of practice, with its received authorities, sacred texts, exemplary achievements, and generally accepted benchmarks, and from within the perspective of that context judges something to be true or inaccurate” (“Postmodern Warfare”). Certainly, ethics come from increasingly varied sources; ultimately, however, as Fish sensibly argues, they should always remain open to critical interpretation and collective debate among the community of action. However, once an ethical decision is reached, we must discard Fishian prevarication for Sontagian commitment. Though sympathy does not necessitate action, decisions are contingent upon commitment, and while it is all well and good to look sympathetically at war and fish passively for commitment, it is only by making decisions and following through with them that we can truly alter reality.', 'Looking at War, Fishing for Commitment', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '286-autosave', '', '', '2012-02-27 14:13:44', '2012-02-27 14:13:44', '', 286, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?p=413', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
(288, 5, '2011-12-19 07:58:56', '2011-12-19 07:58:56', 'No one can deny that American culture has changed significantly over the last forty years. These cultural changes have been manifest in all arenas of American society, and there is no reason to expect that academia would be excluded. In each of their essays, Mark Edmundson, an English professor at the University of Virginia, and David Denby, a film critic for the New Yorker, address the impact of contemporary culture on the attitudes and behaviors of modern college students. Edmundson and Denby notice similar trends but come to conclusions that differ substantially in intensity and perspective.\r\n\r\nIn his essay “On the Uses of a Liberal Education: I. As Lite Entertainment for Bored College Students,” Edmundson attacks the impact of modern consumer culture on the academic world. He believes students and teachers must resist this entertainment ethos and return to the concept of genius to overcome apathy. On the other hand, in “Homer I,” David Denby writes from a different, perhaps more culturally revealing, perspective, having returned to Columbia University to retake the core curriculum. Denby too senses academic apathy in modern students, but he nevertheless points out similarities to his own experiences in college. More importantly, Denby’s essay reveals a lot about cultural evolution through his discussion of his own progression from a heavy reader to a restless and fidgety one. As a current first-year college student, I can speak to the cultural motivations behind the behavior that my generation, as a whole, has exercised in academia. In a sense, the modern college student is taking off from the point where Denby has landed. We have grown up in the same culture that has turned him into a restless reader. It is not clear yet where we will go from here. And it is also not clear that our departure point is necessarily inferior to Denby’s. Ultimately, it comes down to perspective. The authors differ significantly in perspective, but neither author views the issue from the perspective of the students themselves, and, as a result, all they can offer is speculation on our state of mind. My perspective, however, is not without its own flaws, being that I have an inherent desire to defend myself and my generation. Even so, I understand the positions of each author and do not find them wholly without merit.\r\n\r\nIn his essay, Edmundson represents the modern college student as an ironic, skeptical, laidback consumer, who never gets too excited about any intellectual idea and constantly looks to relate his studies to pop culture. Edmundson blames this degeneration on the “culture of consumption” that pervades the academic world (4). Edmundson writes how a university administration today can transform its campus into a “retirement spread for the young” in order to attract the most appealing students (5). Furthermore, Edmundson contends that, contrary to the 1960s, when there was no doubt that the college, not the student, was in charge, now colleges market to students (6). Edmundson even goes so far as to call the current process “a buyer’s market” (6). As a college freshman who very recently went through the college application process, I can confirm that it is anything but. While I understand that colleges are in constant competition for applications from the best students, the students are in a much fiercer competition to get into the best colleges. High school students don’t stress over their class ranks, take SAT prep classes, and load up on AP classes and extracurricular activities because they want access to the finest gym equipment money can buy. Some of them are certainly so competitive because they think their financial future depends on the name written at the top of their college diploma. But the great majority of them are so competitive because they want access to the best academic resources and most distinguished professors. In short, they want an education.\r\n\r\nDespite his bias, Edmundson aptly portrays the formation of the current culture and the indoctrination implemented on my generation. He admirably avoids the temptation to blame the students themselves for their perceived shortcomings, instead acknowledging the profound effect of his generation (which “let the counterculture search for pleasure devolve into a quest for commodities”) on the current cultural outlook of modern college students—the children of Edmundson’s generation (4). The idealism and radical enthusiasm of the baby-boomers, who constantly challenged the status quo, fizzled into cynical consumerism. The effect of this shift on my generation was both cultural and personal. Not only did it affect the culture that we were raised in—a culture that came to value material goods and the sound bite—but it also affected our view of cultural rebellion itself.\r\n\r\nMy parents went to Reed College, one of the most liberal and activist schools in the country, especially in the 1960s and ’70s. I have heard every story about protests, marches, and students taking over college buildings. And that’s great. The times certainly called for a response from the youth of America, and they delivered. But they didn’t change the world. In the end, they came to accept the world that their parents had created. My dad is a federal prosecutor, and my mom is a college professor. Neither of them would be too happy to see any colleges taken over any time soon. My parents were part of a movement that was trying to change the system, and now they work for that system. What exactly does that say to me and my generation? It doesn’t say you can’t change anything so don’t bother trying. But it does say be skeptical of radical ideas. So despite the stories they may hear, students now have no reason to challenge the culture, no reason as Edmundson puts it to “make a spectacle of themselves” (3).\r\n\r\nEdmundson accurately describes how this culture was formed and how it has affected academic institutions, but I am not convinced that he understands the perspective of the student, and I find his conclusion, if it can be called that, about the future of the university simplistic and inadequate. In his essay Edmundson covers one and only one aspect of the academic exchange at colleges—class discussion. He may be right that as a result of a culture that devalues brash comments, discussion has devolved from its heyday in the 1960s into “rebound teaching” in which the teacher takes a student’s “weightless comment” and turns into a valid and interesting point about the subject (5). However, this in no way reflects a lack of intellectual curiosity. Cultural evolution may hinder full-fledged, highly enthusiastic discussion in class, but students still engage in the material through in class questions and comments (which may be timid but are nonetheless legitimate), papers, and individual reflection. As a result, I reject Edmundson’s notion that the current academic atmosphere is molding nothing more than “one dimensional men and women [. . . ] who live for easy pleasures” (11). Moreover, I find his assertion that “it is up to individuals and individual students in particular to make their own way against the current sludgy tide” (12) completely unrealistic. If Edmundson truly wants a return to the academic exuberance of the 1960s, he cannot expect it to come from a generation that was born twenty years later.\r\n\r\nEdmundson’s argument that something is wrong culminates in his discussion of the loss of the concept of genius. Edmundson believes that the idea of genius, which has been “denigrated” by the current academic culture, has the power to reverse the trends of intellectual apathy (11). He writes, “By embracing the works and lives of extraordinary people, you can adapt new ideals to revise those that came courtesy of your parents, your neighborhood, your clan—or the tube” (11). Edmundson seems to imply that what the current generation of college students lacks is ambition; in short, that we are resigned to a culture that values “the easy A,” that we care only about making money without having to work too hard. Edmundson quotes Walter Jackson Bate in praising a concept of education in which we link ourselves to past geniuses “through what Keats calls an ‘immortal free-masonry’” in order to be “what we most want and value” (11). I agree with Edmundson that connecting with and imitating the geniuses of the past can put us in a position to do great things, and I also agree that the modern college student may not embody this ideal, in large part, because of the skepticism our culture seems to have engrained in us. But rather than eliminating the pursuit of genius altogether, I think this skepticism has delayed our receptivity to the concept, forcing us to search harder and longer for it. It was Keats himself who said, “The imagination of a boy is healthy, and the mature imagination of a man is healthy; but there is a space of life between, in which the soul is in a ferment, the character undecided, the way of life uncertain, the ambition thick-sighted.” We are in that space between. We ought to be uncertain at this point in our lives. We ought to be skeptical. We ought to question those who we are told are geniuses. We should seek out that which inspires it and embrace it, but we’re in no rush.\r\n\r\nDavid Denby’s contemporaries at Columbia in the early ’60s were in a rush. Denby describes them as “preoccupied with Sartre and Kafka, Beethoven and Modern Jazz Quartet,” creating a “snobbish version of Columbia” (40). As an undergraduate at Columbia more than forty years lately, I can confirm that that era has passed. Denby raises some of the same issues as Edmundson when comparing his class to modern Columbia students. He describes something very similar to “rebound teaching” in his reference to “lockup” among the freshman in his Lit Hum class (44). Denby talks about how the professor, Tayler, “would take what the student had said, however minimal, and play with it, enlarging it so it made some kind of sense, and then weave it together with the three or four intelligible words that someone else had said” (44). However, Denby is far less critical and even comments that he “often didn’t know the answer” and felt anxious when he was in school (44). Moreover, Denby mentions the fact that Tayler’s “rebound teaching” often gave students the confidence to participate in an actual full-fledged academic discussion (44). Denby’s comments suggest that things aren’t quite as bad as Edmundson’s nearly apocalyptic position makes them out to be.\r\n\r\nOf course neither author argues from a precise or scientific standpoint. Both are bound by their highly subjective positions. Despite these obvious shortcomings and limitations, their perspectives do have unique advantages in analyzing academic and cultural changes. Both authors are well-educated, presumably in their forties or fifties, and highly attuned to the cultural changes they have witnessed in their lifetimes. However, they seem to have taken divergent career paths—Edmundson has stuck to his academic roots in becoming a professor, while Denby has seemingly launched himself into American pop culture by becoming a film critic. As a result, Edmundson is highly critical, sheltered by an academic, somewhat arrogant vantage point, while Denby has chosen a profession that allows him, in a way, to criticize the culture from within.\r\n\r\nFrom this perspective, Denby offers an interesting account of the cultural evolution that has taken place in the last 40 years and the impact it has had on the attitudes of the typical college student. Upon his return to Columbia University to retake Lit Hum and C.C., Denby recounts the days of his youth and college years, when he “would fall into a novel for hours” sitting in bed in his dorm room (47). Now in his late forties, Denby describes his lack of “discipline for serious reading,” his concentration wandering “after twenty pages” (36). Denby himself seems to have devolved in parallel with the culture. He explores the “culprit” of this descent, considering and then dismissing the notion that all the movies he’s seen in the last thirty years have “broken the circuits” (47). Instead Denby suggests the theory that his “life had grown much more complex” to account for his daydreaming (47). I offer another theory. I would argue that Denby’s lack of enthusiasm for reading has less to do with his own development into adulthood than with the development in culture that has occurred since his youth. In my opinion, Denby was on the right track when he contributed his literary downfall to movies. He grew up in a culture that valued literature and reading for hours. My generation has grown up in a different culture—a culture where children and adults alike are sucked in by television and movies and have trouble truly delving into a book, especially when it’s required reading.\r\n\r\nEdmundson is right. In considering the question of why the modern college student is so different now than he or she was 40 years ago, the answer is most definitely the culture. Culture has changed, as it inevitably does and will in the future. Many like Edmundson believe that it has changed for the worse, especially in the academic realm. Maybe Edmundson will prove prophetic. Maybe the skepticism and apparent indifference he describes do signify a serious problem with the academic future of our country. Maybe they are the beginning of the end. But maybe what’s really coming to an end is not intellectual curiosity or genius, as Edmundson concludes. We still care about ideas. They’re just different ideas. We may not be interested in revolution, but that doesn’t mean we won’t change the world. We may be more concerned with Pulp Fiction, Kurt Vonnegut, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers than with Macbeth, Aristotle, and Mozart, but is there anything wrong with that? Edmundson’s utopian vision of an academic world where thirty passionate students develop a Freudian interpretation of Survivor is a fantasy. In its place sits a generation of individuals who are, at worst, jaded, cynical, and bored and, at best, intelligent, ambitious, and critical. It may take more for us truly to get excited about an idea, but when we do, we can be just as intense and passionate about it as our predecessors, though we may not show it. Maybe we haven’t lost the concept of genius as Edmundson affirms; maybe we’re just looking for it in different places and with a little more discretion.', 'What’s Wrong with Movies?

(289, 5, '2011-12-19 07:59:05', '2011-12-19 07:59:05', 'My grandmother loves to tell stories. She grew up poor in the heart of Philadelphia, but her tales, replete with Indian princesses and stunning young sailors, have always reflected optimism. Which was why I was taken by surprise one morning—over bagels and the Sunday paper, of course—when she described her freshman year at Penn State University. Schools at that time imposed strict quotas for Jews, so there was only one other Jewish girl on her floor. As my grandmother and her friend wandered around campus, they would often feel eyes at their backs; when they chatted with their Christian floor-mates, they always sensed that they were being inspected. Finally, my grandmother asked what was so beguiling. One of the girls asked, "Where do you two hide your tails? We know you Jews have them—we''ve all seen them in pictures."\r\n\r\nTo me, the most unsettling part of her story was not its content, but the natural and unaffected tone she maintained while telling it. As it turns out, I shouldn''t have been taken aback: this sort of misunderstanding, egregious though it may have been, as commonplace in the 1940s. The deliberate misrepresentation of Jews—for political gain, or simply to alienate a minority religion—capitalized on the widespread anti-Semitism of the World War II era to make lies into mainstream "truth." But how are intelligent, decent young men and women made to believe that Jews have the horns and tails of devils? bell hooks, author of "In Our Glory: Photography and Black Life," would smile knowingly at my disbelief, for she understands that images are much more than pictures—they are tools for persuasion, and ultimately for control.\r\n\r\nImages, according to hooks, have a powerful ability to define. "Such," she writes, "is the power of the photograph, of the image, that it can give back and take away, that it can bind" (56). Some pictures epitomize a sentiment so perfectly that they become eternal: two strangers spontaneously kiss in the street as the end of war is announced, and they are immortalized. Other depictions, because they embody an ideology that the powerful wish to promote, are ubiquitous in a more sinister way. This is the realm of blackface theatre—and of Nazi propaganda. A well-crafted image placed in the right hands can become a symbol of solidarity, leading to respect or even mutual admiration; in the wrong hands, it can wreak havoc across borders and across generations.\r\n\r\nIf a picture speaks a thousand words, then people attempting to pry equality from the hands of the oppressor must first create authentic images to defend against false representations: That is the conclusion bell hooks reaches in her examination of the struggle for black empowerment. She contends that the ability to create "images of ourselves that transcend the limits of the colonizing eye" (64) is paramount for those who wish to defeat racism. Even the fight for equal access (desegregation) was in some ways a distracting battle in the quest for true enfranchisement of and respect for black culture. The real power that white people always had, and still retain, is the ability to, as Roger Wilkins writes, "define reality where blacks are concerned and to manage perceptions and therefore arrange politics and culture to reinforce those definitions" (58). To overcome prejudice and racism, minorities must fight on the representational, image-based war front.\r\n\r\nWhile hooks applies her claims exclusively to the realm of photography, they are even more unsettling when applied to false images that have been deliberately generated to persuade or to distort—images depicting Jewish shopkeepers with false scales or Jewish lawyers advocating for demons. In Europe, images such as these were made pervasive as part of a move to discredit Jewry. They accompanied a dramatic increase in public anti-Semitism, which manifested in verbal, then political, and finally in physical assault. In America, prejudice and discrimination were far subtler but just as distressing: many of the restrictions on Jewish life that the Nazis codified—the exclusions from schools, jobs, even restaurants—were already in place in a less systematic but no less real way for American Jews. On either side of the Atlantic, it was not easy to be a Jew in the World War II era; perhaps by considering hooks'' theories about representational politics, we can begin to see why.\r\n\r\nI don''t mean to contend that the prejudice my grandmother encountered was the direct result of a smear campaign an ocean away, however well-organized it may have been. Most Americans had never seen Nazi propaganda, and even if they had, it is unlikely that they would have heeded it, since Americans and Germans were sworn enemies. But although the images were not a factor in America, the imagery was the same; Jews were still sly devils, villainous, not to be trusted around children. Thus, the examination of propaganda both provides an extreme example of how representation inflects anti-Semitism, and helps explain how my grandmother found herself in the uncomfortable position of explaining her highly conventional backside.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the black liberation movement in the United States, hooks writes, "the issue of representation—control over images—was never as important as equal access" (57). The focus for the civil rights activists was for the most part turned away from changing the "conventional, even stereotypical, modes of representing blackness" because the expansion of legal entitlements was broadcast as a universal elixir for solving black America''s problems (hooks 58). Once legal equality was established, the tune went, blacks would be free to prove themselves the equals of whites, and misrepresentation would no longer be an issue. Blacks were lulled into a false sense of security, and realized too late that equal rights did not mean economic or social equality. Thus, "racial integration [created] a crisis in black life"—victory had already been declared, but the fight had barely begun, leading to a critical lapse in vigilance (hooks 58).\r\n\r\nJews made a similar mistake in the 1930s during Hitler''s rise to power. As the anti-Semitic images began to appear on windows and in schools, Jews were understandably disturbed but did nothing: after all, they were "just" pictures. The representational battle was forfeited, and the Nazis were free to misconstrue Jewry as they pleased. In an already anti-Semitic culture, they took their slander to disastrous extremes: posters of Jewish butchers putting rats into their meat gave way to images of Jews feeding Christian babies to the grinder. When the Nazis put their Final Solution into effect, the public stood by; it was easy, natural even, to allow Jews to be treated like animals after being conditioned with images of Jews as dirty rats.\r\n\r\nIf European Jews realized too late that "representation remains a crucial realm of struggle," perhaps American Jews did not realize it at all, for it manifested in less physical, but no less objectionable, ways (hooks 58). After all, no prison camps awaited my grandmother, no Gestapo hunted her—and yet it was common knowledge that she was the spawn of the devil. Unlike blacks, American Jews had always been grudgingly accommodated into the mainstream—for all the signs that read "No Jews, No Dogs," for all the insinuations of a Jewish conspiracy for world domination, Jews still voted, held office, and succeeded in business and politics. Since anti-Semitism was more muted in America than in Europe, Jews ignored the way they were misconstrued; according to hooks, this was the fundamental problem. When the rights of blacks were even marginally respected, hooks writes, they were more willing to "perfect the [black] image for a white-supremacist gaze," and their subjugation continued in a subtler manner (62). For my grandmother, this meant putting up with prejudice and ignorance because she was one of the lucky ones—after all, she was let into college in the first place.\r\n\r\nBut I am not willing to settle for a reluctant indulgence of my people, to let old bigotry hide under the glossy surface of modern religious tolerance. hooks believes that the only way to disprove hegemonic images is to counter with authentic images—for the sake of outsiders, who do not know the truth, and for insiders, who forget it. Through the use of cameras, she writes, "The degrading images of blackness that emerged from racist white imagination and that were circulated widely in the dominant culture [...] could be countered by "true-to-life" images" (59). I am still skeptical about applying this statement to Jews, even when considering means of representation other than photography. We have always known what we stand for and we need no internal "sites of resistance" to remember it: my grandmother attended synagogue despite the difficulties of being labeled as a Jew (59). We are tied to our history, our heritage, and are proud participants in our community—this is why we have survived centuries of pogroms and inquisitions. But hooks continues "As we looked at black skin in snapshots, the techniques for lightening skin that professional photographers often used [...] were suddenly exposed as a colonizing aesthetic," and this does ring true (61-62). As Jews assimilate into American society, we are becoming more and more secular, Christian even, and are losing the rich culture of Yiddish language and Klezmer music that used to define us. We are learning to identify more with "colonial ways of looking [at] and capturing [...the] ''other''" than with genuine representation of Jews "in our glory" (62, 54).\r\n\r\nThis was as true sixty years ago as it is today. Jews were taught, through enormous social pressure, to distance themselves from our past and from the tightly knit Jewish community that had always been our bulwark. We were tolerated only in the degree to which we were able to pretend to be a part of the Christian world—to hide our tails, in a sense. We allowed mainstream culture to "frame us within an image of racial hierarchies" (although here, it was a religious hierarchy) that forced us to constantly justify and defend our differences; finally, it became easier to simply blend in (hooks 62). My grandmother speaks Yiddish, but my father does not, and I know far less even than him. There is a dire need for Jews to produce an authentic representation of our past that embraces our culture unapologetically.\r\n\r\nIn World War II-era Europe, the stakes were higher: the means of separating Jews from their foundations were far more extreme, and the result of doing so was far more disastrous. As the Nazis began so blanket the streets with anti-Semitic propaganda, Jews (especially the less religious) distanced themselves from their roots in order to distance themselves from the damaging lies. In cities across Europe, the Jewish Quarters, once full of laughter and the music of accordions and clarinets, slowly fell silent. Jews lost cohesion, they lost faith in their traditions, and when the Nazis came they were divided and vulnerable. Jews were in desperate need of "a means [...] by which an oppositional standpoint could be asserted, a mode of seeing different from that of the dominant culture", a means of affirming their irrefutable worth as humans and as a people (hooks 59). Let me be clear: the Holocaust was the result of European bigotry, fear and indifference, not the failure of Jews to meet Nazi propaganda with Jewish counter-propaganda. However, perhaps the Jews would have been a little less complacent, and the rest of Europe a little less complicit, if Jews had better respected our way of life and defended it against the onslaught of misrepresentation. The Nazis'' ultimate legacy is not the impossible extent of their cold-blooded murders—it is that, decades after their "defeat," the Jewish Quarters still lie silent.\r\n\r\nAlthough hooks writes that "All colonized and subjugated people [...] recognize that the field of representation (how we see ourselves, how others see us) is a site of ongoing struggle," it is not so clear that Jews in either Europe or America reached the same conclusion in the 1940s (57). European Jews failed to realize the importance of actively promulgating a view of Jewry as a rich, worthy, and, above all, human culture, and paid the ultimate price for their indifference. In America, Jews felt lucky in comparison, and thus did little as prejudice in its more insidious forms took root. Gradually, the very culture of Judaism eroded, leading one to wonder: on what, exactly, did my grandmother stake herself? The answer to that is the challenge for modern Judaism. Perhaps, as hooks believes, photographs and pictures are the answer, but a picture cannot capture the strength of unity, the depth of culture, the proud history that being Jewish encompasses—we need more. Jewish culture is full of goodness: in their purest forms, our sense of community is enviable, our music is profound, and our ethical traditions are full of hope, idealism and a sense of world citizenship. Jews need to remember all this, to embrace it without shame or restraint; we must ourselves become the living image of the way we wish to be remembered and perceived.

In the dream, I was giving a concert, playing one of the exacting pieces from my repertoire, when I played a wrong note. Instantly the scene shifted from the concert hall to Hell, where I was still seated at the piano but now was being lapped by scorching flames, the scent of sulfur thick in the air.\r\n\r\nThe dream did not bode well for my later ability to grasp subtle symbolism, much less create it on the page should I ever become, say, an aspiring writer. But more importantly, it demonstrated a fundamental truth about my approach to music—and perhaps to life, for in musicians these things are inextricably bound up with one another—during my early years as a pianist. It may be facile to say, merely, “I was afraid of making mistakes.” What musician, what artist, what human being is not, on some level, afraid of making mistakes? And it is just as certainly facile to suggest that this fear—any fear, but especially this one—is stifling. But what then do we do with my unsubtle, unsettling dream? If it is simple, should its antithesis be equally simple? Must one simply give in to the inevitability of mistakes? And if one gives in to mistakes, how can one then rebuild one’s demanding, perfectionist, artistic self?\r\n\r\nIn his essay “Play and Theory of the Duende,” Federico García Lorca explores the possibility that there are three abstract entities which are responsible, metaphorically, for the creation of art. The first and most familiar is the muse, of whom Lorca writes:\r\n<blockquote>The muse dictates and sometimes prompts. She can do relatively little, for she is distant and so tired (I saw her twice) that one would have to give her half a heart of marble....The muse awakens the intelligence, bringing a landscape of columns and a false taste of laurel. (51)</blockquote>\r\nLorca’s style is freely associative and almost exclusively symbolic—he would not have found much inspiration from my dream—and so his essay resists distillation into simple, logical premises. But clearly the muse he is describing is Classical: if she inspires art, it is the orderly, well-proportioned kind, scrupulously obeying the laws of Aristotle’s Poetics, or the geometry of the Golden Section. The muse, let us say, was exceedingly kind to Haydn, and not too stingy with Mozart, either.\r\n\r\nThe second of Lorca’s personifications is the angel, who “guides and gives like Saint Raphael, defends and avoids like Saint Michael, announces and forewarns like Saint Gabriel” (50).\r\n\r\n“The angel dazzles,” he continues,\r\n<blockquote>but he flies high over a man’s head, shedding his grace, and the man effortlessly realizes his work or his charm or his dance...and it is useless to resist their lights, for they beat their steel wings in an atmosphere of predestination. (Lorca 50)</blockquote>\r\nOnce again, this definition is difficult to pinpoint, but the word “effortlessly” is key. Michelangelo’s ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican may be too outspoken to obey Classical orders, but it is too inevitable to admit of any difficulty, any struggle in its creation. Fittingly, this is work inspired by the angel.\r\n\r\nIf the muse dictates and the angel dazzles, what then does duende do? Well, for a start, Lorca writes that:\r\n<blockquote>he burns the blood like a poultice of broken glass, that he exhausts, that he rejects all the sweet geometry we have learned, that he smashes styles, that he leans on human pain with no consolation and makes Goya...work with his fists and knees in horrible bitumens. (51)</blockquote>\r\nIf Lorca’s definitions of muse and angel are difficult to distill, his definition of duende is impossible. Crudely speaking, duende is a dark inspiration, culled from human suffering (this is reductive, but it will do for now). More importantly, duende does not merely allow, but insists upon mistakes. Lorca writes of an audience member who, complaining of a lack of duende in a performance, “sarcastically murmured, ‘Long live Paris!’ As if to say: ‘Here we care nothing about ability, technique, skill. Here we are after something else’” (52-53). The something else, he goes on to tell us, is duende, and instead of technique and skill it requires a “scorched throat,” the ripping of clothes, the divestment of “skill and security” (Lorca 53). Duende is a jealous muse: it demands that we “reject the angel, and give the muse a kick in the seat of the pants, and conquer our fear of the violet smile exhaled by eighteenth-century poetry” (Lorca 51). Which is all fine and good, but it leads to the question: What is it, and where can I get some?\r\n\r\nI find my answer in an unexpected place. I find it in jazz, a music I grew up listening to but never seriously played until I had left classical music—and my Classical muse—behind. But to understand how duende reentered my life and music, one must first understand a bit about the history and theory of jazz.\r\n\r\nJazz music arose out of the wreckage of a collision of cultures, a violent mishmash of tonal colors and vocabularies, each developed in its own right and then uprooted (as in the case of African improvisational field chants), reappropriated (Southern spirituals), or simply ransacked for its valuable spare parts (Western classical music). What evolved is a singular genre among all the arts: it requires instantaneous, on-the-spot improvisation, but within a set of strict theoretical rules. Composing a jazz solo on stage is rather like attending an improvisational poetry slam and, instead of coming up with sprawling free verse, producing a fully formed sestina or villanelle completely impromptu, with nothing protecting you from the audience but a set of lights and a microphone.\r\n\r\nYet jazz demands more than accuracy of technique, although technique and understanding are essential. It is a musical form which invariably demands duende—it cannot be played without breaking rules. And while it is reductive to talk about these transgressions in technical terms, a little explication may help illuminate how intrinsically transgressive all jazz must be.\r\n\r\nOne could begin, for example, with “blue notes”—notes used in jazz and blues scales in order to imitate vocal effects and give the music a “bluesy” sound. The problem with blue notes is that they are outside the traditional twelve-tone Western scale: to play them on Western instruments, one must in fact play out of tune, between two different notes. But more importantly, blue notes do not have an exactly defined place: if a musician plopped them down dead center between the two tones on either side, they would not be recognizable as blue notes to true jazz lovers, even if music theorists declared them appropriately blue. Instead, blue notes must be sought out—they represent a vocal effect, after all, and it is the effect of a voice breaking between notes, burdened by its meaning and its pathos. Blue notes do not strive for mathematical precision; they strive to show the inherent imperfection built into all human experience, and to do that, they must themselves be imperfect notes.\r\n\r\nThe same admittedly reductive technical point could be made about another technique in jazz, namely that of “side slipping,” or playing “outside.” The simple explanation of side slipping is that it juxtaposes unexpected scales against the expected or dictated chord progression of a song in order to produce dissonance. That is, the chords of a song call for one scale, but the soloist deliberately plays another scale, a “wrong” scale, to surprise and even offend the listener’s ear.\r\n\r\nOf course, this definition is also incomplete, just as it is incomplete to say that blue notes fall in the space between two real notes. Anyone can play the wrong scales during a solo. Indeed, to an untrained musician, playing the wrong scales is usually easier than playing the right ones. Side slipping, in order to be effective, must play these wrong scales at just the right moment, in just the right combination, in order to surprise the listener without losing or completely obliterating the form. The beauty of the technique is in its careful juxtaposition of the expected with the unexpected; duende rips the flesh off the form, but the skeleton reminds us what it used to look like.\r\n\r\nThat these techniques are difficult to master is not the point. The point is that they both require a kind of abandonment of mastery: the muse gives us rules, the angel gives us technique, but only the duende can inspire such lucid excursions away from the rules, outside the technique. Without duende, I am back to my fear of mistakes.\r\n\r\nI stopped playing classical music at the age of twelve and more or less never looked back. Between my already crushing fear of mistakes and the increasingly competitive atmosphere as I advanced in the classical music world, I had lost the joy I originally took in making music. I re-found it, though, almost instantly, in the form of jazz. And if I am able to write now with some semblance of confidence about arcane and profound points of jazz theory, it is because I have devoted the last eleven years of my life to becoming a jazz pianist. I feel fairly confident that I have gone further as a jazz musician than I could have as a classical musician.\r\n\r\nWhich is not to say that every time I sit down at the piano to play jazz, duende perches on my shoulder, infusing the music with a spirit of rapturous suffering and technical transgressive brilliance. Aside from the abyss that lies for all musicians and artists between idea and execution, there is also with jazz a constant struggle between technical prowess and emotional immediacy, between muse and duende, between knowledge and spontaneity. Resolving this struggle requires hours of exacting practice; and since the most important practice for jazz musicians happens not in the practice room but on the bandstand, it requires a fair amount of embarrassment and pride-swallowing, as one works out one’s problems in front of an audience and fellow musicians. Moreover the jazz world is exceedingly competitive: one will always walk into a club and hear a musician whose technique and duende both exceed one’s own. The jazz musician never stops learning—even from the same recordings or the same songs, over and over again—and this means an almost constant confrontation with the possibility of embarrassing, heart-rending, hell-bending mistakes.\r\n\r\nBut it is not a mistake if this description is starting to sound more and more like the classical music world I left behind. The irony of digging deep into my own duende is that now I see duende everywhere, where before I saw only muse and angel. Now I realize that classical music, played without the underlying possibility of mistakes, would be as flat and meaningless as jazz without blue notes. Jacqueline du Pré’s wide, wild vibrato, J. S. Bach’s relentless, over-exuberant modulations from key to key, Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony blaring its “Ode to Joy” at the top of its lungs for chorus after unending chorus—what muse would dare claim credit for these things of beauty; what angel dare claim that his wings fanned their flames? I may not, at this point, ever return to playing classical music. I do not need to. I realize that the muse with her Classical Pantheon has no room for sprawling, messy genius, the only sort of genius for which I have any appetite. No matter: duende steps in, trailing symphonies of wrong notes; I’d rather slip sideways into the sublime.\r\n\r\n<em>posted by cu-uwp</em> Keywords: e1, essay 1, 2004\r\n\r\n</div>', 'Muse, Music, Mistakes: A New Search for Duende', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'muse-music-mistakes-a-new-search-for-duende', '', '', '2012-03-23 15:32:20', '2012-03-23 15:32:20', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=290', 0, 'essay', '', 0),
(399, 2, '2012-04-09 20:15:46', '2012-04-09 20:15:46', 'My grandmother loves to tell stories. She grew up poor in the heart of Philadelphia, but her tales, replete with Indian princesses and stunning young sailors, have always reflected optimism. Which was why I was taken by surprise one morning—over bagels and the Sunday paper, of course—when she described her freshman year at Penn State University. Schools at that time imposed strict quotas for Jews, so there was only one other Jewish girl on her floor. As my grandmother and her friend wandered around campus, they would often feel eyes at their backs; when they chatted with their Christian floor-mates, they always sensed that they were being inspected. Finally, my grandmother asked what was so beguiling. One of the girls asked, "Where do you two hide your tails? We know you Jews have them—we''ve all seen them in pictures."\n\nTo me, the most unsettling part of her story was not its content, but the natural and unaffected tone she maintained while telling it. As it turns out, I shouldn''t have been taken aback: this sort of misunderstanding, egregious though it may have been, as commonplace in the 1940s. The deliberate misrepresentation of Jews—for political gain, or simply to alienate a minority religion—capitalized on the widespread anti-Semitism of the World War II era to make lies into mainstream "truth." But how are intelligent, decent young men and women made to believe that Jews have the horns and tails of devils? bell hooks, author of "In Our Glory: Photography and Black Life," would smile knowingly at my disbelief, for she understands that images are much more than pictures—they are tools for persuasion, and ultimately for control.\n\nImages, according to hooks, have a powerful ability to define. "Such," she writes, "is the power of the photograph, of the image, that it can give back and take away, that it can bind" (56). Some pictures epitomize a sentiment so perfectly that they become eternal: two strangers spontaneously kiss in the street as the end of war is announced, and they are immortalized. Other depictions, because they embody an ideology that the powerful wish to promote, are ubiquitous in a more sinister way. This is the realm of blackface theatre—and of Nazi propaganda. A well-crafted image placed in the right hands can become a symbol of solidarity, leading to respect or even mutual admiration; in the wrong hands, it can wreak havoc across borders and across generations.\n\nIf a picture speaks a thousand words, then people attempting to pry equality from the hands of the oppressor must first create authentic images to defend against false representations: That is the conclusion bell hooks reaches in her examination of the struggle for black empowerment. She contends that the ability to create "images of ourselves that transcend the limits of the colonizing eye" (64) is paramount for those who wish to defeat racism. Even the fight for equal access (desegregation) was in some ways a distracting battle in the quest for true enfranchisement of and respect for black culture. The real power that white people always had, and still retain, is the ability to, as Roger Wilkins writes, "define reality where blacks are concerned and to manage perceptions and therefore arrange politics and culture to reinforce those definitions" (58). To overcome prejudice and racism, minorities must fight on the representational, image-based war front.\n\nWhile hooks applies her claims exclusively to the realm of photography, they are even more unsettling when applied to false images that have been deliberately generated to persuade or to distort—images depicting Jewish shopkeepers with false scales or Jewish lawyers advocating for demons. In Europe, images such as these were made pervasive as part of a move to discredit Jewry. They accompanied a dramatic increase in public anti-Semitism, which manifested in verbal, then political, and finally in physical assault. In America, prejudice and discrimination were far subtler but just as distressing: many of the restrictions on Jewish life that the Nazis codified—the exclusions from schools, jobs, even restaurants—were already in place in a less systematic but no less real way for American Jews. On either side of the Atlantic, it was not easy to be a Jew in the World War II era; perhaps by considering hooks'' theories about representational politics, we can begin to see why.\n\nI don''t mean to contend that the prejudice my grandmother encountered was the direct result of a smear campaign an ocean away, however well-organized it may have been.

(291, 5, '2011-12-19 07:59:39', '2011-12-19 07:59:39', 'There is a section of the Talmud devoted to the complicated subject of life after death. This section contains imaginative debates on the existence of the afterlife, its location, its contents, and, most importantly, who it is open to. In one discussion, the Talmud speculates that the hereafter is a giant classroom filled with the great Rabbis of yore discussing the fine points of Jewish law for all eternity. For anyone who spent his life devoted to Jewish law and study, this classroom is heaven. For everyone else, it is hell.\r\n\r\nSeveral months ago I found myself thinking about this explanation as I sat in a similar classroom, albeit one located in my Yeshiva in Israel. At the front of the classroom a teacher was expounding on <em>Halacha</em>: the highly logic-based Jewish legal system derived from the Talmud and meant to serve as a guide to the rituals and laws of Judaism and more generally as an all-encompassing guide to life. The topic of the day was the laws of the Sabbath and my teacher''s analysis was as thorough as usual. "If a pot of soup is placed on a fire before the Sabbath," he explained, "one may take if off the fire during the Sabbath. However, if one places it back on the fire, he has violated the Sabbath." He continued, "If one adds water to it, he has violated the Sabbath. If one stirs it, he has violated the Sabbath." He paused, as if expecting the class to leap with surprise, and then continued, "The Talmud brings a case where a person stirred the soup after the pot was taken off the flame. Rabbi Akiva says this person has violated the Sabbath while Rabbi Eliezer says he has not."\r\n\r\nWhat I can''t begin to explain is how utterly boring such <em>Halacha</em> discussions are. Talmud study is one thing; the fine-tuned dialectical legal analysis and the close text study can be strangely fascinating. Pure <em>Halacha</em> lessons, on the other hand, generally consist of one long laundry list of dos and don''ts, and unlike Talmud study, which is often done as a purely intellectual exercise, <em>Halacha</em> lessons are supposed to have some "practical" real-world application.\r\n\r\nOn that day, however, the practicality was lost to me and I couldn''t help but muse to myself, with a slight dose of Jewish irony, "so this is heaven?" But then it hit me: was this detail-obsessed, legalistic learning in fact supposed to be heavenly? What was this law, this <em>Halacha</em> that I was meant to study as if it held the key to all existence? Was there any Truth in it; was there even any common sense?\r\n\r\nThe familiar cycle of negotiating compromises between past convictions and present priorities is the subject of Gerald Early''s essay "Their Malcolm, My Problem." Early, a professor of African-American Studies, sees two paths that the contemporary black community has taken. On the one hand, Early sees that his young students have embraced radical Black Power and Afrocentric politics. On the other hand, he sees that his daughters, having grown up in a white suburban neighborhood, seem disconnected from their black identity. Early''s own relationship with his past attraction to the Black Power Movement, especially to the ideas found in The Autobiography of Malcolm X, come into play as he is forced to negotiate between his past belief in Afrocentrism and his present "white" suburban lifestyle. In one particularly telling scene in the essay, Early rants to one of his daughters about the dangerous messages found in the Autobiography of Malcolm X.\r\n<blockquote> "Never have I been subjected to more anti-intellectual, proto-fascistic nonsense than what I have had to endure in the name of Afrocentrism. And this man," I said, waving Malcolm''s autobiography, "is the architect of it all, the father of Afrocentrism. This idiot, this fool." I slumped at the kitchen table, placing my forehead against the cool wood. "But I thought you liked Malcolm X," she said (90).</blockquote>\r\nEarly does indeed "like" Malcolm X; he is nostalgic for the days when Malcolm''s message moved him to be proud of his black heritage. Early finds himself in an almost paradoxical situation: he recognizes that the civil rights movement has allowed him to achieve the suburban "white" lifestyle that was once closed to black Americans. He recognizes that Malcolm X may have been misguided in his demands that blacks separate themselves from American society and that integration has, in fact, been possible. But although The Autobiography of Malcolm X now seems to Early "as narrow as it was vivid" (87), he is also nostalgic for the days when it moved him to be proud of his black heritage and to fight the white establishment. He fondly remembers a story about when he and his friend Gary stood up to a group of racist thugs and regrets that the story means nothing to his daughters. Indeed, he feels that his daughters have "no sense of blackness" (96). Early finds himself in limbo between the Black Power politics of Malcolm X that he rejected, and the Civil Rights Movement integration that has given him the success and affluence he now has. This doubt over the path his life has taken plagues Early and forces him to try to reconcile his desire for a sense of black "specialness" (95) with the knowledge that his children are receiving privileges they never could have in the age of Malcolm X.\r\n\r\nIt is this feeling of limbo, this sense of doubt over the path life can take, that I experienced that day in <em>Halacha</em> class. The belief I once had in the importance of<em>Halacha</em> was simply no longer there. I found myself wondering what, if anything, had ever made me believe in <em>Halacha</em>: what had allowed me to treat this elaborate system of rules and regulations as an all- encompassing guide to life?\r\n\r\nIn elementary school, whenever I or a classmate would ask a teacher "why this detail?" or "why that ritual" the pat response would always be "because this is what God expects of you." When probing further, a teacher might mumble something about getting "a reward from God," although this was always said with a tone of reluctance. As I grew older, these questions were replaced with a sense that<em>Halacha</em> was simply as much a part of my life as school, friends and family. I simply didn''t have the time or the patience to grapple with such metaphysical questions and I gradually fell into a cycle of complacency.\r\n\r\nMy unthinking acceptance of <em>Halacha</em>, however, was challenged during the first few weeks of high school. At the end of the school day, a group of us would often start walking towards the nearby bus stop. Immediately after the school was out of sight, my friends would remove their yarmulkes, the caps which are supposed to be worn by Orthodox males at every moment. Inside the school building the teachers forced us to wear our yarmulkes, but outside no-one was stopping us from taking them off and enjoying a bus ride home without the uncomfortable knowledge that everyone on the bus knew we were Orthodox Jews. I too contemplated taking off mine, but something always held me back. When trying to identify this unseen force, this feeling of unease at the idea of publicly violating Jewish law, I found my way back to that murmured word from elementary school: "reward." Surely if God expected me to wear my yarmulke constantly, as my teachers claimed, He would reward me for it. This explanation became my guiding light during high school.<em>Halacha</em> became a system where the more details I followed, the more reward points God would give me. Who knew when or where this reward would be given? The simple understanding that each element of <em>Halacha</em> had some meaningful ramification was enough for me.\r\n\r\nAt Yeshiva, I found myself surrounded by Judaism and <em>Halacha</em> and soon this explanation began to lose its appeal. I looked around at the many Rabbis and students who devoted so much time to the study and practice of <em>Halacha</em> and began wondering what their motivation was. Was it one giant game of reward-and-punishment for them as well? I often found myself thinking about that strange section of the Talmud concerning the afterlife. The anecdote about the giant classroom is intended to demonstrate that finding fulfillment through religious study and <em>Halacha</em> should be akin to heaven: one should not grudgingly practice Judaism in anticipation of some other reward in the afterlife, because what awaits is simply more of the same. But I could not understand how <em>Halacha</em> could be valuable in and of itself, without the promise of a reward. I continued to practice and study<em>Halacha</em>, but my actions began to feel petty and meaningless. Still, it was difficult to give up practices and rituals that had so long been a part of my life, even while the hypocrisy of adhering to <em>Halacha</em> without knowing why weighed hard on me.\r\n\r\nTowards the middle of my year at Yeshiva, several teachers announced the creation of a new class, the title of which translates roughly to "Applied <em>Halacha</em>." Intrigued, I attended the first lecture with Rabbi Elisha, a <em>Halacha</em> expert and theologian. Rabbi Elisha''s interpretation of <em>Halacha</em> shocked and intrigued me: he claimed that <em>Halacha</em> is not a set of rules meant to be mindlessly followed out of some existential deference to God. Rather, it can be seen as a complex, changing social system. He stressed that the moral rules of Judaism should always take precedence over ritual, but every ritual also has some basic human value at its core. The intricate and complicated details of <em>Halacha</em> are necessary, Rabbi Elisha maintained, since the more a person remains hyperconscious of the details of a ritual, the more the value of ritual shines through.\r\n\r\nRabbi Elisha''s lectures also tackled the Laws of the Sabbath. For him, the Sabbath and its many intricate rules were about demarcating a special day of rest from the banal, work-filled days of the week. The many laws of stirring soup on the Sabbath were designed to permeate every detail of life with this separation, forcing a person to remain conscious at every moment of the special nature of the Sabbath.\r\n\r\nRabbi Elisha''s philosophy helped me realize that I did not need to abandon<em>Halacha</em>; I needed to reinterpret it by framing my understanding around its human and social values. With Rabbi Elisha''s help, I began reexamining <em>Halacha</em>, searching for the human value behind it. I felt as if I had graduated from the simplistic theological lens of reward-and-punishment towards a new and higher Truth.\r\n\r\nBut such things rarely end up as simple as they sound at first. Early looks back on his past Afrocentrism with a romantic sense of nostalgia. From a practical point of view, his suburban "white" lifestyle offers him everything the Civil Rights Movement fought for: dignity, freedom, equality. Yet Early on some level regrets the loss of black separateness that came with the end of segregation. He understands the appeal of Malcolm X''s Afrocentrism for his young students: it provides that sense of "specialness" that separateness can bring. As Early sees his daughters adopting "white" values he remembers the appeal of the simple worldview of the Afrocentric movement, even though it is anathema to everything he has become. When I left Yeshiva, I too began to feel a tension between the honesty of my new worldview and the simplicity of my old one. I found it difficult to remain committed to the entire system of <em>Halacha</em> when my rationale was the "human value" of it. I missed the straightforwardness of my old reward-and-punishment model, where every detail, no matter how insignificant, had meaning.\r\n\r\nAt Columbia, I faced a familiar dilemma: whether to stop wearing my yarmulke in order to fit in with the college community, like many of my friends. I decided to apply Rabbi Elisha''s philosophy, but could not reach a satisfactory answer. I did not believe there was any value to announcing my separateness every minute of the day when I had so much to learn from my non- religious or non-Jewish fellow students and teachers. With Rabbi Elisha''s model, I was still committed to <em>Halacha</em>, but much more willing to let certain rules lapse, especially when the sociological or human value seemed either absent or outdated. My old outlook explained all of<em>Halacha</em> through a simplistic theological model whereas perhaps my new outlook could not explain it well enough. With Rabbi Elisha''s philosophy, I was simply much more willing to pick and choose which rules of <em>Halacha</em> I wanted to follow. And so, I decided to take off my yarmulke, relegating it to be worn only on the Sabbath or in synagogue.\r\n\r\nGerald Early negotiates an uneasy compromise between his prior faith in Malcolm X''s Afrocentrism and his present American values. Recognizing that "blacks are people of ''double- consciousness''" he argues that "both blackness and American-ness are real options, each having meaning only when measured against the other" (99). His claim is that the entire black community must try to find common ground between Afrocentric separateness and assimilation into mainstream American society.\r\n\r\nBut Early is unclear about how the recognition of this "double-consciousness" can provide any practical path for the black community to follow. What must his daughters change about their lives to rediscover "blackness"? What must his students change to find "American- ness"? Early''s solution is problematic because it implies each African American must handle the struggle as an individual rather than as part of the community. The only thing shared is the existence of these two identities: the "strange, yet poignant and immeasurable, record of an imperishable human presence" (Early 100).\r\n\r\nThe <em>Halacha</em> dilemma is less one of two identities than of motivation; it is thus a more concrete (and perhaps fixable) problem, albeit one that will probably take me many more years to even begin to resolve. I do know, however, that my early teachers did me a disservice by glossing over the question entirely. It took Rabbi Elisha to remind me of the need for a critical engagement with <em>Halacha</em> and its many rules. Other teachers in the Jewish establishment should learn from Rabbi Elisha, and begin acknowledging the complicated questions of what it means to be a <em>Halachik</em> Jew, especially when dealing with elementary and high school students. If the process of learning to think critically and philosophically becomes more mainstream in Jewish education, perhaps more people will be able to make that giant classroom in heaven have meaning on Earth as well.', 'Not Stirring the Soup and Knowing Why: My Search for Meaning in Halacha', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'not-stirring-the-soup-and-knowing-why-my-search-for-meaning-in-halacha', '', '', '2012-03-23 15:33:51', '2012-03-23 15:33:51', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=291', 0, 'essay', '', 0);

I was back in Harvard Square, where I had lived the preceding summer while interning at the Democratic National Convention. I was pleased to return, but I knew it was to a different place. Out of Town News, Harvard Yard, the Quad, Felipe’s Taqueria: none of them were the same—the landscape had changed. The musicians had left the streets to find a lonely coffeehouse mic. The LaRouche proselytizers had left to hibernate for another four years. The t-shirts and sandals of summer sun had retreated in the face of winter’s austere countenance. My political innocence was gone, as well. Two weeks ago, the election had fallen upon me with all the heavy weight of reality. Challenged by the outcome, I was a changed person looking at a changed landscape: over everything, an inch of fresh snow.\n\nI walked slowly to my friend’s dorm where I would be spending the weekend. Quiet lingered in the air. I could hear the soft crunch of New Balance on slush. It was as if the election had hastened the arrival of winter, as if the capitol of liberal politics was eager to retreat to the safety of the fireside. There, in oak-paneled studies with bookcases, thinking citizens would insulate themselves from the anti-intellectual New America, thumbing endlessly through back copies of the <em>New Yorker</em>, mourning past evocations of hope and possibility. I peered through the humble Puritan windowpanes along Dunster Street, convinced that those citizens were in each room. I watched my breath disappear in the falling snow, wondering where American borders really lie.\n\nByron E. Shafer opens his book <em>Bifurcated Politics</em> by admitting, “Even in an era when it is widely viewed as an institution in decline, the national party convention retains a certain immediate, raw, and visceral fascination” (1). I can sympathize. As a young politico working the convention, being in such a high-level political environment was exciting. I spoke to Jesse Jackson and James Carville on the phone. Terry McAuliffe (T-Mac to those in the know) was constantly in my midst. I shook hands with Barack Obama and Larry David, and I took a picture with George McGovern. Teresa Heinz Kerry signed my poster. I patiently awaited my CNN interview with cellphone in hand and credentials around my neck.\n\nWhat I was less apt to recognize was the “institution in decline” part of the experience. We the convention committee (in order to form a more perfect union), perched atop a skyscraper looking down on the Old State House, would hear about Mayor Menino’s problems with the police union. We would hear that Boston was going to lose—rather than gain, as was originally believed—significant sums of money on the convention. We would hear the complaints of Bostonians: too much traffic, altered public transportation, increased terrorist threat. We would hear, but we weren’t really listening. After all, they, the complainers, were on the outside. They couldn’t understand that it was all necessary. What did they know?\n\nIn her essay “Insider Baseball,” Joan Didion speaks to my experience. Writing about the Dukakis campaign of 1988, she considers the “assumption” of people within politics that “the narrative should be not just written only by its own specialists but also legible only to its own specialists” (50). Part of me thought that since I had an ID card that said DNC 2004 on it, I was more qualified to assess the convention. Those on the other side of the glass didn’t really know what they were talking about.\n\nDidion also details a scene in which Dukakis plays catch with one of his campaign aides on an airport tarmac. Didion writes:\n<blockquote>What we had in the tarmac arrival with ball tossing, then, was an understanding: a repeated moment witnessed by many people, all of whom believed it to be a setup and yet most of whom believed that only an outsider, only someone too ‘naïve’ to know the rules of the game, would so describe it. (65)</blockquote>\nDamned if I would be naïve. A friend of mine who had worked on the Dean campaign in New Hampshire (and was now in Vietnam on a fellowship) complained about the unnecessary level of control and choreography that he saw going into the convention. I told him it was all necessary: the lighting cues, the careful choice of music, the placement of the delegations on the floor, the speakers’ obligation to submit speeches beforehand for approval. “We can’t risk a disorganized appearance,” I insisted, “there is too much at stake.” What we needed, I believed (not uniquely, I might add), was to project an image of unified professionalism that would dispel, among other things, notions of a party torn by an extraordinarily divisive primary season. John Kerry was our man, and he would deliver us from George W. Bush’s dark presidency. Any calls for a more natural political forum misunderstood political strategy. Those who made those calls were, by definition, “outsiders.”\n\nThe narrative of insiderism that the convention unwittingly created proved to be destructive to its appeal. A bubble—dreaded in theory, embraced in practice—surrounded all things DNC. I remember on Thursday night, the last night of the whole spectacle, my friend Eric, who was interning for CNN, was able to get me into a party at the Roxy. Maroon 5 played the event. In the middle of the set, John Edwards—sleeves rolled up, tie loosened, mic in hand—appeared onstage in front of a dramatic green light as a fog machine did its thing. He looked heroic, almost godlike. He engaged the crowd: “This may look like a concert, this may feel like a concert, and this may sound like a concert.” The crowd quieted. We waited for his words. “But this is a movement.” We erupted. We were, of course, ready to cheer.\n\nEven this memory—one I recall so fondly—has paled since the election. Whereas I originally experienced it in terms of Shafer’s raw, visceral fascination, now I can’t help but see the shadow of decay about it, evidence of a declining institution. There I stood with two different credentials (one for the Fleet, one for the Roxy) in the plastic sleeve on my “Democrats Win It in the Field” lanyard, supposedly affirming some sort of “movement.” Was this the field? Was this where we were supposed to win it? After leaving one closed event, I was now at another closed event, both of which had further levels of exclusivity within them. Even worse, we—supposedly the party of the First Amendment—feared protests so much that we restricted peaceful demonstrations to an aptly named “Free Speech Zone” festooned with nets to “protect the delegates.” On the closing night of the convention, I stared as hundreds of police donned storm trooper riot gear and clogged the surrounding streets.\n\nWe assumed the movement Edwards referred to must have been some sort of popular uprising against the Republicans. But surely velvet ropes and nightsticks do not comprise a popular movement. In Boston, Massachusetts, the seat of leftist American politics, America’s foremost liberal party managed to hold a convention detested by the city’s citizens. Having always believed the Democrats to be a populist alternative to the stodgy GOP, I associated them with popular appeal. After all, Jules Witcover calls his history of the Democrats Party of the People. But the character of their convention—our convention, as it were—denied any such claim. In the end, far from anything I could have imagined earlier, exclusion may have been the name of the game. It certainly was at all of the satellite events: the Media Party in south Boston, the Rock the Vote party at the Avalon, the delegate parties throughout the week, the closing party at the Roxy. A prevailing insiderism dominated what was supposed to be our chance to show the country we were not a party of distant intellectual elites. It reminds me of my high school history teacher’s favorite phrase: “Lost opportunity.”\n\nThe parties, the symposiums, the caucuses, the book signings, the balloons, the music, the traffic, the t-shirts: all this, and for what? Conventions simply boost a general election season by approving a candidate already chosen. In reality, the DNC is little more than an extravagantly expensive gas station on the campaign trail. How expensive? The <em>Boston Globe</em> set the estimated cost of the convention at $95 million (Klein). Is it really justifiable to put that much money into such a weak institution, an institution whose own biographer considers it to be declining? If the convention were to serve a more pivotal purpose, such funding might be excusable; but to throw so much money at ratifying a foregone conclusion seems downright irresponsible.\n\nThe convention as an institution has not always been so weak. It was not always like today’s incarnation, essentially a well-dressed figurehead strutting around with a practiced air of self-importance. In fact, political conventions began in 1832 as a reaction against the same elite class that today’s conventions serve to propel. It was the nation’s first third party of note, the Anti-Masons, which introduced the concept of a national political convention. In <em>Party of the People</em>, Jules Witcover writes:\n<blockquote>(The Anti-Mason convention) was born of a case of the suspected murder of one William Morgan, of Batavia, New York, a former member of the secret Society of Freemasons who disappeared as he was about to publish an exposé of the society. Attempts to block its publication created demands for an investigation and ultimately a clamor against Masons in public office, culminating in a call for a convention to nominate a presidential candidate. (143)</blockquote>\nIronically, that convention nominated William Wirt, a rather uninteresting candidate who specifically stated his indifference to Masonry, to stand against Masons Andrew Jackson and Henry Clay (Witcover 143). However, much like today’s third parties, the Anti-Masons were less interested in a viable campaign than in national attention to their issues of import. As Shafer writes, “The quickest route to national stature was a presidential campaign, but the new party could hardly launch such a campaign with the dominant nominating device to that date, a caucus of party members in the U.S. Congress, because it possessed none” (9). From that point on, the national convention would replace the party caucus as the primary theater of presidential nomination. How strange it would be for the Anti-Masons to see the national convention, this child of theirs, existing today on the lifeblood of exclusivity and police security.\n\nIn terms of power, 1832 marked the beginning of a period that would last until 1952, at which point the convention began to look quite like the current ones. Within this period, the convention exhibited great power, deposing numerous sitting presidents, including John Tyler, Millard Fillmore, Franklin Pierce, and Chester Arthur. It also chose dark-horse candidates like James K. Polk (Shafer 15). Convention discourse centered mostly around the nominee in question, with some conventions featuring extended debate on whom to choose. But the decline of local political parties, as exemplified by New Deal legislation, had prepared the original convention character for its last hurrah in 1952. Shafer writes, “The Democratic convention of 1952 was the last of the classic old-style party gatherings and featured behavior which in its essence would have been familiar to convention participants a hundred years before” (33). He continues: “The product of this politicking, the candidate, had entered no primaries and engaged in no direct campaigning prior to his nomination” (33). Every convention thereafter demonstrated the shift of the nomination away from the convention itself and into the primary season, creating a movement towards today’s condition in which the convention serves only to approve a decision already made.\n\nThat shift accelerated in 1968 due to the tumultuous Democratic convention in Chicago, at which tens of thousands of protestors took their dissent to the streets. Their calls for bringing the political process nearer to the people ushered in an era of reform politics that saw the proliferation of the primary season, one perceived solution to the problem of high-level political bureaucracy. As a result, the convention evolved into the weakened form it holds to this day (Shafer 42). Stripped of its original nominating function, the convention began to look more like a risk than an opportunity. The two election cycles of the 1970’s demonstrated this idea. Shafer writes:\n<blockquote>In 1972, a Democratic convention featuring deep divisions between the nominee and his challengers and between the nominee and some of his own delegates was paired with a Republican convention featuring little evident conflict in either area. Yet only four years later, it was the Republican convention which manifested the major candidate conflict, along with exacerbating issue divisions, while the Democratic convention escaped candidate splits entirely and surfaced only minor issue conflicts to fuel its limited struggles. (150)</blockquote>\nIn both 1972 and 1976, the party that presented a more unified convention won the general election. This contrast between unity and disunity, unity triumphing each time, proved to be a lesson politicians would not soon forget. With the potential for a divisive primary season constantly threatening to produce an image of a party in conflict, conventions began to focus energy on polished appearance rather than honest debate. Disunity, an ominous sign of weakness, took on the characteristics of a risk to avoid at all costs.\n\nFor better or for worse, it seems the Democrats know their history. The 1970s conventions set a precedent—unity at all costs—that the national parties emulate to this day. One can imagine T-Mac and convention CEO Rod O’Connor sitting in a well-lit office late at night pondering the official convention slogan. America 2004: The Democratic Convention, or America 2004: A Stronger America? The differences are subtle, even aesthetic. But by July 26, the message had changed from the former to the latter. There could be nothing weak about this convention; history warns as much. “Strong” necessarily conjures images of unity, for strength is predicated on organized support. At the expense of a real political forum, we proceed with this historically fortified notion of strength, for we have learned the lessons of the ’70s. Certainly “unschooled” has never been an accusation leveled at Democrats. Nevertheless, the Golden Age of conventions is dead, and even the current age declines. Surely Swinburne waxed rhetorical when he asked, “Is not Precedent a king of men?”\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow that the post-election pall had descended and winter had frozen over Harvard Square, I began to reevaluate my memories. After all, “we” had lost. This summer, good little Democrat that I was, I probably would have described the color of the convention as some sort of fluorescent blue. Now I might side with the dreaded gray. Neither red nor blue, Republican nor Democratic, just—gray. Perhaps my experience of disillusionment is simply a function of election depression. Or perhaps the election has been my apple, and I have eaten of it. Either way, I recall feeling like we had something—whether it was momentum, passion, or truth on our side, I’m not sure. But there was something that has faded now.\n\nThe November issue of <em>Harper’s</em>, which was released before the election, aptly demonstrates the Democrats’ obsession with presenting a united front. Ironically, it is Luke Mitchell’s essay about the Republican convention that accomplishes this, even as he lets the Democrats off the hook. He writes, “Whereas Kerry had struggled to create meaning—no matter how stupid, dishonest, or clichéd that meaning was—Bush’s team seemed actively to be plotting its demise” (67). Mitchell treats Kerry kindly, keenly aware of the approaching Tuesday. Mitchell continues, considering the discussion that took place in the Garden: “These were half-narratives, made up of questions so preposterous as to end discussion and possibly even subvert our understanding of what it means to mean something…The real message, radiating from the podium and echoing through the rafters, was that there was no message” (67). It is not difficult to imagine a covert Luke Mitchell marooned in The Red Sea, subconsciously holding his nose while straining his ears to catch the words between the echoes. The fact that he couldn’t decipher any message suggests that the Republicans know their historical precedents, too: Organization at the expense of meaning.\n\nBut now that the election is over and all may speak freely, one must wonder if Mitchell would still excuse Kerry. Perhaps not—I, for one, with hindsight shaded by the election, find his appraisal of the Republicans quite applicable to the Democrats. The Dems’ platform professes “a profound optimism about our future—an optimism that springs from our great faith in America” (Strong 1). In terms of gritty policy-talk that one might expect from a political platform, the document sounds more like a stump speech. It avoids confronting Iraq, turning that question instead into a section called “Strengthening Our Military.” It says, “We will add 40,000 new soldiers—not to increase the number of soldiers in Iraq, but to sustain our overseas deployments and prevent and prepare for other possible conflicts” (13). Worse, the title of the platform, the overall message, amounts to more of a non-message: “Strong at Home, Respected in the World.” Who can argue with such a stance? Is it a stance? The statement is eternally malleable: Anyone could mold it to his or her particular ideology. It is both isolationist and internationalist. It is both militant and gradualist. In essence, it is both liberal and conservative. It draws no lines, because it comes down on the side of no one. Even as the Dems tried to learn from history’s convenient lessons, they came up short. The Democratic message tried to be all things to all people—and still the electoral map bleeds endlessly. Perhaps we spoke directly to no one. Such is the risk of a politics of caution. In my own words, “There is too much at stake.”\n\nMitchell realizes that risk. In a later passage in his essay, he discusses the effort of the Republican convention to appear completely inoffensive, an effort I found similar to the Democrats’. He tries to recount the atmosphere of the Garden to a friend, who refers him to E.M. Forster’s <em>A Passage to India</em>. “It’s the Marabar Caves,” his friend tells him. Mitchell notes, “He was almost impossibly right.” Forster describes the caves:\n<blockquote>Whatever is said, the same monotonous noise replies, and quivers up and down the walls until it is absorbed into the roof. “Boum” is the sound as far as the human alphabet can express it, or “bou-oum,” or “ou-boum,”  utterly dull. Hope, politeness, the blowing of a nose, the squeak of a boot, all produce “boum”…. (68)</blockquote>\nIn a literal sense, the Marabar Caves recall to me the first night of the convention, when I was sitting very high up in the Fleet Center, straining my ears to hear the Clintons. The echoes were definitely overwhelming at times, and I missed much of what was said. But Mitchell cites Forster to get at something deeper. What Mitchell is concerned about is the conscious decision to sterilize discourse, to the extent that blowing one’s nose and expressions of hope both sound like “boum.” Both parties are guilty of this transgression; most likely the Republicans just play the game better. Forster realizes this, too. In the same passage, he writes, “Echoes generate echoes.” Today, echoes generate elections.\n\nAs I approached Kirkland House, my friend’s Harvard dorm, I took my earbuds out so I could concentrate on the directions he had given me. First gate on the right, proceed into the courtyard, turn left, look for the dining hall. No one had shoveled the walkway in the courtyard yet; I left footprints in the snow as I walked towards the door. Through the tall windows, I could see chandeliers and crowded tables. It looked warm inside.\n\nMonths before, we had visited this building, often late at night, so that my friend (who also interned with me) could show me where he would be living for the next three years of college. Another friend of his was spending the summer in the next house over, Eliot House, so we would go there, too, and we would have long political discussions in the night. We were like the “pink-cheeked young aides” Didion recalls in her essay, thinking of ourselves, “innocent of irony and therefore history, as ‘the best and the brightest’” (56). It rarely—if ever—occurred to me that the next time I would return, winter’s cold winds would have swooped down on the wings of the election to clear the landscape. There was an air of immortality about our convention work that summer. I assumed victory and the concomitant vindication would have taken place by now. From the heights of the Fleet Center, defeat looked impossible.\n\nIn <em>The Politics of National Party Conventions</em>, David, Goldman and Bain write: “Convention decisions cut close to the great political concerns of any society: the allocation of political power, the purposes for which political power shall be used, and the further evolution of the political system” (2). As a representative institution, as a symbol of a larger political process, the convention does not bode well for the future of politics. If the characteristics of this summer’s Democratic convention were to continue—the tendency towards insiderism, the construction of the “boum”—American politics would have some work to do before it could once again call itself a worthwhile organ of a government that pretends to democracy.\n\nEven now, in the wake of a disastrous election, the Democrats’ discussion of the future seems less interested in lasting change than more of the same. Take, for example, the theater in which a recent discussion took place. The New York Times reports that “Most of the party’s biggest names headed to former Clinton campaign adviser James Carville’s party at the old Arkansas Gazette Building, which served as the headquarters of Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign. Some partied at Doe’s Eat Place, an old Democratic hangout” (Democrats 1). That gathering sounds like a smaller version of this summer’s convention: elite figures discussing the nation’s future over cocktails. The words “old Democratic hangout” fall harshly upon my ears. But even the discourse itself comes up short. Governor Bill Richardson says, “I remember being on a trip with him in New Mexico: I put a cowboy hat on Senator Kerry and someone on his staff shuddered and asked me to stop. This is I think an example of the East Coast not connecting with the West Coast and with the rest of the country” (Nagourney 2). If Governor Richardson is right, this country is in a sad place: he believes it is more effective to pander to the “rest of the country” through empty props than actually to address issues they care about. Surely it’s less—not more—of Richardson’s theatrics that the political process needs.\n\nPerhaps I am simply unschooled in politics’ dark arts. Surely there are mysteries I cannot comprehend. After all, I am merely a has-been pink-cheeked young aide, stepping softly through the snow to meet up with my friend. If I was an insider before, by now I am a definite outsider. Apparently, you need not be one or the other to care. As for those thinking citizens, hibernating with stacks of the New Yorker, I found them in the Kirkland dining hall, discussing the Warren Court for a paper due in three days. Outside, on the trees and in the gardens, across the lawns and in the sky, the falling snow cleansed the canvas, painting over everything with a broad white stroke. Preparation for rebirth had already begun, for the winter always precedes the spring.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWorks Cited\n\nDavid, Paul T., Ralph M. Goldman, and Richard C.

(292, 5, '2011-12-19 08:02:36', '2011-12-19 08:02:36', 'From April through mid-July of 1994, the small African nation of Rwanda was the site of nearly one million systematic murders of men, women, and children suspected to be ethnically Tutsi, Tutsi supporters, or otherwise threats to the government. In the aftermath of the genocide, academics have theorized a variety of explanations for how high unemployment, extreme poverty, and political instability combined to cause “the Hutus” to take revenge on “the Tutsis” through violence and murder . Yet these daunting numbers and totalizing statistics create an image of two distinct factions blindly attacking each other, which is far from the reality of the situation. Carried out mostly by machete and through local militias, the Rwandan genocide is perhaps one of the most personal (that is, intimate) in history. It follows that, to truly understand the genocide’s cause, one must examine the mentality of Rwandans on the individual level at the time.\r\n\r\nIn the 1960s, psychologist Stanley Milgram was also interested in understanding obedience and its role in the Holocaust. He theorized that the power of authority plays a large role in coercing individuals to action and therefore conducted a series of experiments at Yale University aimed to answer the question, “How does a man behave when he is told by a legitimate authority to act against a third individual?” (Milgram 4). While the environment in which genocide takes place may be drastically different from the laboratory of Milgram’s experiments, the fundamental question I have cited remains the same. Significantly, Milgram’s findings have traditionally been written about with a strongly individualized approach, highlighting excerpts of debriefings and analyzing how the background of particular participants influenced their thinking. On the other hand, the Rwandan genocide has historically been represented as a conflict between two homogeneous groups. By juxtaposing findings from the Milgram experiment with the individual stories of two Hutus – one who resisted calls to violence and one who obeyed them – I hope to create a gateway through which we can come closer to realizing the complex factors surrounding each Rwandan’s choice of actions on the eve of genocide. While high-level administrators engineered the violence “to resist political change which they perceived as threatening”, the immediate actors carrying it out had far different motivations, ranging from misplaced morality to group conformity (Prunier 242).\r\n\r\nIn April 1994, seven Tutsi pastors wrote a desperate letter to their superior Pastor Elizaphan Ntakirutimana from the confines of their church complex in the Kibuyu region of Rwanda. It stated, among other things, “We wish to inform you that […] tomorrow we will be killed along with our families” (Gourevich 42). Ethnically Hutu, Pastor Ntakirutimana had distinguished himself at the outbreak of fighting by encouraging the local hidden Tutsi population to find shelter in his building, yet quickly his followers began to feel deceived. Pastor Ntakirutimana and his son were frequently seen conversing with the Hutu Power militia and Presidential Guard, and eventually it was his son who announced their execution date. In response to their letter, one survivor recalls, the Pastor wrote “Your problem has already found a solution. You must die” while another remembers, “You must be eliminated. God no longer wants you” (Gourevich 28). On April 16, 1994, Hutu military entered the supposed sanctuary and indiscriminately slaughtered nearly all 8,000 refugees – men, women, and children – in the church and hospital complex of Mugonero. The few who survived succeeded only by concealing themselves under corpses and fleeing after dark.\r\n\r\nIn the same month that Pastor Ntakirutimana delivered his refugees into the hands of the Hutu military, Paul Rusesabagina, an ethnic Hutu and temporary manager of the upscale Hotel des Milles Collines faced a decision of his own. Beginning April 7, this international tourist destination had been flooded with Tutsi and anti-Hutu Power supporters fearing for their lives (“Leave”). From the beginning, “Rusesabagina spent his days buying lives of Tutsis with liquor, reasoning, persuading, so that each band of killers who came to the hotel to take out various Tutsis on their lists for killing somehow ended up going away” (“Share”). Through newspaper interviews and telephone calls to leaders in Belgium and the United States, Rusesabagina secured National Police protection of his hotel. In two separate incidents, officials of the Department of Military Intelligence informed Rusesabagina that his occupants would be massacred by day’s end, and to evict them as soon as possible. Not bowing to the pressure, he instead contacted the French Foreign Ministry using a hidden fax line to inform and pressure the United Nations about the threats. Both times the situation was diffused. At the end of the hundred days of genocide, all his guests had survived unharmed, and Rusesabagina has become synonymous with heroism during the Rwandan genocide.\r\n\r\nMilgram’s experiment on obedience serves as the central point of analysis for both Rusesabagina and Pastor Ntakirutimana in this paper, so let us first describe its method. In Milgram’s experiment, volunteers in the lab were introduced to another supposed volunteer who was actually a confederate of Milgram’s. Through a rigged drawing, the volunteer would be designated the “teacher” while the confederate actor would be the “learner.” The teacher, after being given a sample 45-volt electrical shock, was given a list of questions to ask and instructed to give the learner increasing levels of electrical shock for incorrect answers by pushing a switch on a generator. The switch panel was labeled with voltages from 15 (“SLIGHT SHOCK”) to 450 volts (“XX”). Unbeknownst to him, the machine did not function. The learner was hidden from view in a room next door, and as the shock level increased, he would begin to complain of the pain until eventually demanding to be let out, screaming, and falling silent with no response, which was treated as a wrong answer. Contrary to the expectations of psychologists Milgram polled beforehand, a stunning 65 percent of subjects completed the experiment, “delivering” lethal 450-volt shocks. In order to fully understand what the experiment tells us about how Rwandans could become killers of their own neighbors, we must look closer at the ways in which subjects read various messages into the experimental procedure, allowing obedience to become easier.\r\n\r\nIn response to the first three protests by the teacher to stop the experiment, experimenters were directed to say, “The experiment requires that you continue” (Milgram 21), thus implicitly placing responsibility on neither himself nor the volunteer but rather the name of science. Misplaced responsibility is exactly what allowed Milgram’s subjects – and many who participated in the Rwandan genocide – to continue. As Milgram reasons: “Most subjects in the experiment see their behavior in a larger context that is benevolent and useful to society – the pursuit of scientific truth” (9). A source as impartial as science is not likely to purposefully endanger lives, and thus many volunteers dutifully continued. Placed in a similar situation being demanded by the government to murder known Tutsis, “[m]any Rwandans say that they killed because authorities told them to kill” (“Leave”). Indeed, for months a barrage of radio and other government-controlled media reports expounded upon the evils of the Tutsi ethnic group and “involved explicit and regular incitations to mass murder, constant verbal attacks on Tutsi, the publication of lists with the names of hundreds of people-to-be-killed, threats to anyone having relations with Tutsi, etc” (Uvin 110). Having been subjected to such discourse every day, Pastor Ntakirutimana came to give in to its call. Furthermore, whereas Milgram’s subjects faced no actual physical threat if they were to end the experiment, the pastor very well could have jeopardized his life by not turning his church over to the militia. Not satisfied with the response from its regular military members, the government also created “civilian self-defense” militias which armed and trained ordinary citizens and then ordered them to kill the Tutsi and their Hutu sympathizers. For some perpetrators of the genocide, the prospect of increasing their own wellbeing or that or their nation overall through displacement of Tutsis was a large draw.\r\n\r\nNeither were the killers in Rwanda as devoid of morality as they seemed, a fact illustrated by Milgram’s volunteers who readily accepted that the experimenter would be responsible for the learner’s injuries. Volunteers, assured that they were not at fault, felt themselves protected in their actions and continued with less guilt. Many Hutu militia members and other participants in the Rwandan killings have also frequently insisted they were merely carrying out orders handed down from above, an mindset easier to understand when viewed in light of pre-colonial Rwanda’s “strong tradition of unquestioning obedience to authority” that was “reinforced by both the German and the Belgian colonial administrations” (Prunier 241-42). In his own defense, Pastor Ntakirutimana himself claimed to be helpless in the face of authority. Though the church complex was his own, when the mayor of Mugonero said there was nothing to be done, he believed him and fled (Gourevich 41). Although legally, the experimenter’s culpability and the Rwandans’ powerlessness against authority might stand, as political psychologists John Sabini and Maury Silver note, ethical blame cannot be transferred to others. Referring to Milgram’s subjects they ask, “Yet how could the experimenter take upon himself their responsibility? Responsibility is not property that can be borrowed, shared, loaned, or repossessed” (197). Citing someone else as the cause of one’s actions cannot alter the reality that those very actions were taken by one’s own hands, whether it is directly axing hundreds of Tutsi to death or experimentally delivering a fatal shock to a fellow volunteer. The reasoning is illogical, however, “the essence of obedience consists of the fact that a person comes to view himself as the instrument for carrying out another person’s wishes, and he therefore no longer regards himself as responsible for his actions” (Milgram xiii). In fact, Milgram’s findings show that in these situations, the participant no longer thinks of the larger, deadly implications of his actions, but instead his “moral concern now shifts to a consideration of how well he is living up to the expectations that the authority has of him” to carry out the task at hand (8, emphasis added).\r\n\r\nFinally, the ways in which Milgram’s experiment was designed to break down individuals’ resistance to the task asked of them can be seen at work in the Rwandan genocide as well. The gradual escalation in the severity of the task being asked of both Milgram’s volunteers and Habyarimana’s Hutus is what allowed them to eventually reach their shocking potentials. By only increasing the voltage delivered by 15 after each incorrect answer, Milgram’s teachers found difficulty in deciding when it was appropriate to stop. With each shock was only slightly higher than the last, and repetition making the task easier, little justification existed for stopping at any given point rather than just before or just afterwards. In the same fashion, many who began killing with certain reservations eventually lost them. “Some became more hardened with experience and learned how to slaughter even those whom they had once refused to harm” (“Leave”). Tutsi neighbors and friends later became as worthy of death as the Rwandan Patriotic Front fighter. The extent of atrocities reached the point where one UNAMIR officer said, “I had seen war before, but I had never seen a woman carrying a baby on her back kill another woman with a baby on her back” (as qtd in “Leave”). With each successive task executed, both Milgram’s subjects and the Rwandan killers became increasingly desensitized to their actions as their superiors continued demanding more of them.\r\n\r\nFurther eroding the Pastor’s resistance was the complicity of so many around him that he, too, thought nothing of cooperating with the militia. Milgram’s explanation of group conformity to defy the experimenter in one variation of his experiment can be applied to the Pastor’s situation in reverse. In the experiment, participants were influenced by two rebelling confederates into believing that rebellion was normal or proper and thus acted similarly in order not to be seen disapprovingly by their peers (Milgram 120). In the Pastor’s case, not only was almost everyone around him obeying the Hutu Power government, but a third, related principle of division of responsibility further assuaged any fears he might have had about his conduct: because so many other people were involved in the genocide throughout the country, any moral authority that might have held sway over the Pastor diminished in power. When evenly dispersed between him and the militia, the question of moral responsibility became insignificant. Amongst the general Rwandan public, even, Human Rights Watch found that “[s]ome who refused at the start became convinced to act when all authorities seemed to speak with one voice, when the leaders of their parties joined with administrators to demand their participation and when the military stood behind, ready to intimidate those who hesitated” (“Leave”).\r\n\r\nOne final variable which likely broke any resolve Pastor Ntakirutimana might have had to not abandon his congregation was the perpetual dehumanization of Tutsis in daily Hutu Power rhetoric. From the beginning of the conflict, extremists circulated the Hutu Ten Commandments that depicted all Tutsis and their sympathizers as evil. Ultimately, “[i]t was designed to marginalize the Tutsis and create an atmosphere in which their mass destruction would be acceptable, almost inevitable” (Fergal 10). Although Milgram did not explicitly study the effect of dehumanization in his experiments, he did vary the proximity of the learner to the subject and found that when the victim was segregated and out of view and earshot, subjects completed the shocks at a higher rate, a rough approximation to the psychological distance created between an aggressor and his dehumanized victim (Milgram 22-23). Because Pastor Ntakirutimana did not have to actively participate in the murder himself, instead resting safely out of town with his family, the psychological burden of his actions likely was lighter and easier to bear. Thus, the less like him the refugees became, the easier it was for him to allow for their murder to pass.\r\n\r\nBut if dehumanization, group conformity, and escalation of tasks work to break down resistance, when we turn to Rusesbagina’s story we must ask what bolsters resistance. Some might say proximity, as was the case in Milgram’s experiments. Rusesbagina, as temporary manager of the Hotel des Milles Collines, himself lived with the refugees to oversee the protection of his building, making it much more difficult for him to give in to the demands of the Hutu Power authorities. Just as distancing the subjects resulted in a higher rate of obedience in Milgram’s experiments, bringing them closer together decreased the rate. Proximity to victims creates a more awkward and socially unacceptable situation wherein participants are simultaneously exposed to direct judgment by both the nearby victim and the presiding authority, making an “acceptable” action difficult. In his own analysis, Milgram views the decision-making process as an internal struggle of strain and buffers. For disobedient subjects, the strain of the experimenter’s demands, living up to one’s side of a contract, and furthering the cause of science vie against a sense of morality for the subject’s obedience. Buffer actions, such as teachers hinting the correct answer, are attempts to ease the internal discomfort, but ultimately subjects are driven to end the experiment. The particulars of Rusesbagina’s situation, however, complicate any direct comparisons. Yes, Rusesbagina possessed strong morals and empathy for those who were suffering in his hotel, just as Milgram’s subjects often recalled feeling sorry for the victim if they were ever in the same position (Milgram 51). He also resorted to the ordinarily immoral act of bribery to creatively cope with his situation and buy off bloodthirsty soldiers with alcohol. However, as a well-educated Hutu man in a high-paying occupation, he had little to gain from replacing his Tutsti neighbors and likely was not as susceptible to the Tutsi-dehumanizing radio propaganda. Additionally, he was faced with a third, competing authority (the first being his conscience and the second the militia) of his manager and the international company that owned the hotel. As an employee and caretaker, he was responsible for maintaining the image of Hotel des Milles Collines, a concern whose importance cannot be underestimated in retrospect. Despite these deficiencies in Milgram’s experiment to perfectly explain Rusesbagina’s situation, it is clear that in this case a strong moral consciousness was able to outweigh immoral authority and provide the possibility of hope for individuals facing similar choices in the future.\r\n\r\nBy beginning to understand the actions of Pastor Ntakirutimana and Paul Rusesbagina as individuals first, psychology helps shed light on how great atrocities like the Rwandan genocide can occur. It is neither the result of immutable dogma nor mechanistic orders but rather the accumulation of thousands of individual actions. Psychology, however, cannot model everything and still remains imperfectly restricted to the confines of the laboratory. While focusing primarily on the stories of Ntakirutimana and Rusesbagina, I must also acknowledge a third category that I have only mentioned tangentially and which does as neatly parallel the Milgram experiment: that of the ordinary Hutu peasant-turned-militia member. Facing bleak prospects for the future when the genocide began, these individuals were even more susceptible to the incitement tactics that allowed for Pastor Ntakirutimana’s complicity. However, the breakdown of resistance that includes a transfer of responsibility, dehumanization of the victim, and gradual escalation in severity of tasks is offset in each militia member by the same factors of proximity that led Rusesbagina to disobey. The act of personally confronting each Tutsi to be killed and repeatedly hacking him to death with a machete counteracts the tendency towards obedience to an incalculable degree.\r\n\r\nLooking back, one can only speculate as to the relative strength of each factor in people’s decisions of whether or not to kill. Despite the questions that remain unanswered by science, I believe that overall, viewing the Rwandan genocide in light of Milgram’s experiment reminds us that at the heart of great atrocities lies the actions and pressures of ordinary individuals. As the authors of a retrospective on disobedience in the Milgram experiment state, “if we believe that ordinary people […] can act counter to such streams of destruction, then every one of us may be able to mitigate the harmful consequences of some future malevolent regime” (Modigliani 108). And although the majority of people who find themselves at a crossroads between morality and obedience give in to the latter, the actions of a few courageous people with firm convictions who have refused to compromise themselves assures us of the possibility of a better future.', 'Authority and Genocide in 1994 Rwanda', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'authority-and-genocide-in-1994-rwanda', '', '', '2012-04-10 15:46:41', '2012-04-10 15:46:41', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=292', 0, 'essay', '', 0);

(293, 5, '2011-12-19 08:00:37', '2011-12-19 08:00:37', 'In the final section of her essay “Insider Baseball,” Joan Didion, after a wide-ranging discussion of the American political media, takes a curious detour to visit 544 Camp Street in New Orleans. Historically, the address was connected with Lee Harvey Oswald in the months before he assassinated President Kennedy, as well as being the site of numerous other subversive political activities. What seems at first like a non-sequitur in her narrative, however, upon closer examination develops into a carefully crafted image of the state of politics as Didion sees it. She asserts that the people who had gathered at 544 Camp Street, including and perhaps most of all Oswald, “had taken the American political narrative seriously…They had argued about it, fallen out over it, had hit each other over the head with pistol butts over it” (85). These subversives represent a passionate and combative engagement in politics that Didion sees missing in the consensus narratives that she critiques in the rest of her essay. When she arrives at 544 Camp, however, the building is gone, replaced by a federal courthouse. Nevertheless, she lingers listening to two anti-abortion protesters, described like grotesques of an old political type, the soapbox orator. A young man on a makeshift platform describes “unwanted babies being put down the Disposall and ‘clogging the main sewer drains of New Orleans,’” while the woman with him lip-synchs to a tape, singing “Satan–you''re the liar” (85).\r\n\r\nInto this eerie scene enters a presidential motorcade on its way to the nearby Republican convention. With the image of Lee Harvey Oswald still lingering in our minds, the scene as Didion describes it has seemingly deliberate overtones of the Kennedy assassination. With Didion on the corner watching, police and Secret Service line the streets, while she notices “a man in uniform on a roof” (86). As the “entirely and perfectly insulated” motorcade passes, Didion reflects on the moment, expressing the central theme of her essay:\r\n<blockquote>I stood for awhile on Camp Street, on this corner that might be construed as one of those occasional accidental intersections where the remote narrative had collided with the actual life of the country, and waited until the motorcade itself,…a mechanism dedicated like the process for which it stood only to the maintenance of itself, had passed. (86)</blockquote>\r\nUnlike Kennedy’s motorcade in Dallas, this motorcade passes safely, and obliviously. The political process, and the media which aid and abet it, are perfectly insulated from both the combative, subversive elements and the ideological grotesques that linger past and present in the “melancholy of Camp Street” (Didion 86). This is Didion’s central critique of what has become of presidential politics at the time of her writing in 1988. The democratic process, which she defines in the ideal as “the general mechanism affording citizens of a state a voice in its affairs” (49), has been replaced by a profoundly disconnected process in which media professionals, complicit with those in power, craft a political narrative remote “from the actual life of the country” (Didion 49-50). Her essay demonstrates in rich detail how this narrative is constructed and controlled, but I find myself wondering what for Didion is the “actual life of the country,” and why the mechanisms of democracy have become less combative and more disconnected from those outside of the political class.\r\n\r\nThe actual life of the country, or the empirical as Didion formulates it elsewhere, is in fact largely absent in her essay. The outsiders whom she describes are in one place quintessentially romantic outsiders whom Didion knew in her youth, “the people with whom I had preferred to spend time in high school” (47). Instead of attending elite schools and pursuing careers in Washington, these people “hung out in gas stations” (Didion 47), were drafted, ran off to Carson City to get married, and lived in tract houses on the social and economic edge of America. At other points in the essay, the actual America is a motley collection of types who appear at the fringe of political events Didion attends on the campaign trail. These include a slightly unhinged man at a Dukakis rally, some kids contrarily shouting for Jesse Jackson at another Dukakis event, and the aforementioned anti-abortion protesters. Didion also cites a few statistics to demonstrate the level of apathy among citizens. She notes that “only slightly more than half of those eligible to vote in the United States did vote in the 1984 presidential election” (50). She also points out the lack of viewership of political conventions, as 80 percent of television households did not watch these conventions in 1988. Besides these meager examples, though some are evocative and colorful to be sure, it is hard to locate in her essay a substantive picture of what the empirical realities of America look like. They are largely assumed to be familiar to the reader, or are invoked rhetorically in contrast to the insiders of the political class. In a sense, her outsiders remain in the rhetorical realm of “out there,” without any evident reporting or research to bring them into better focus.\r\n\r\nBut if we allow for Didion''s broad-stroke portrait of the disaffected citizenry, how does she account for the change in the process? As she sees it, the defining moment when combative politics began the movement towards consensus centrist politics was the Democratic Convention of 1968, when street protests outside the convention disrupted the attempt at order going on within. This event exists in the same realm as the Camp Street brawlers: a time when “the process was put to a popular vote on the streets of Chicago” (72). Rather than feeling apathetic, she implies, people outside of the political class were engaged and active in having their say. As a result, “it was decided that what had occurred could not be allowed to recur” (Didion 72). The power and motive behind this change is described thus by Didion:\r\n<blockquote>David S. Broder, in the Washington Post, offered this compelling analysis of the power these “reforms” in the nominating procedure had vested not in the party leadership, which is where the power of choice ultimately resides, but in “the existing communication system,” by which he meant the press, the medium through which the party leadership sells its choice. (72)</blockquote>\r\nBroder’s analysis describes the multiplication of party primaries, and a resulting proliferation in coverage of those primaries, which leads to the state of affairs Didion portrays: vapid, ceremonial political conventions devoid of any real contention. Didion implies in the phrase “it was decided” that the powers-that-be, presumably the party leaders, decided to complicate the primary process in order to prevent unrest like that at the ’68 Convention. In so doing, they invested the media with the power to dumb down debate to the point that the leaders’ choice is the only choice. But it is difficult here to identify how much of this change was intended or planned by those leaders, and how much was a larger evolution of politics and technology taking place beyond specific agency. Did the party leaders and the complicit media create this new process, or did they adapt to a new technological landscape?\r\n\r\nSusan Sontag, in her 2002 essay “Looking at War,” proposes two theories about the impact of the media in general, and television specifically, on the viewing public. In several ways, Sontag corroborates Didion''s thesis of a pervasive media narrative leading to a disconnected citizenry. On the one hand, Sontag argues, “public attention is steered by the attentions of the media” (96). Wherever the media tell us to look becomes the reality we know. But simultaneously, the sheer saturation of these images leads to a deadening effect. So while an event is made more real by its coverage, the overall glut of images leads to a lesser impact. Sontag further defines the nature of this image-glut as an integral aspect of the medium of television: “television is organized to arouse and to satiate, by its surfeit of images. Image-glut keeps attention light, mobile, relatively indifferent to content” (96). Thus, in relation to Didion’s subject, the political media craft their banal narrative, creating “reality” for the public. But the narrative is banal, lacking “a more reflective engagement with content” as Sontag puts it, precisely because of television''s tendency to glide over meaningful content (96). This state of affairs is news as entertainment, what Sontag calls “a mature style of viewing…and a prerequisite for dismantling traditional forms of party-based politics that offer real disagreement and debate” (97). In her mind, a reality does exist independent of the images, but the “sense of reality” has been eroded, and the public has been increasingly reduced to mere spectators.\r\n\r\nIn general, Didion and Sontag would seem to agree on the general nature of the change in political engagement. With the rise of television coverage of politics, there has been a movement away from the scuffling and disagreement of earlier forms of party politicking. The public are increasingly spectators of a process that has been leached of real issues by television’s tendency to gloss. While Sontag’s emphasis is more on the technological effect of television, Didion details the specific construction of narratives. But for both writers, the change in medium has been decisive in the change in political engagement. However, on either side of the medium are the powerful and the public. Their roles in the transformation of politics since 1968—in crafting and consuming the narrative—are vague and hard to locate in Didion’s essay, but I would argue they are far more decisive than Didion’s emphasis on the banal narrative.\r\n\r\nAnother way to consider the issue is to see that politics is ultimately about winning—as much as in sports or the competition of brands. Whoever crafts the more successful or evocative message will convince the most voters to support them and confer the power of governance. In her own nostalgia for the battles of conventions past, Didion misses this larger dynamic– the dynamic of politicians doing what it takes to convince voters through the media. Those disaffected figures of the other America she portrays are not as important as mildly or passionately engaged voters, many of whom might hang out in gas stations and live on the fringes. Successful politics might require successful propaganda.\r\n\r\nIn “Slavery, Ideology, and Race in the United States of America,” Barbara Fields proposes a critical and useful definition of propaganda, as defined in relation to her central theme of ideology. For Fields, ideology is “the descriptive vocabulary of day-to-day existence, through which people make rough sense of the social reality they live and create from day-to-day” (110). Ideologies are embedded in social relations, and are used by people to interpret their positions in collective bodies such as towns, churches, the military, or political parties. Fields makes the key point that while an ideology is integral to a particular group and thoroughly plausible to those inside the group, to outsiders the same ideology might seem irrational or implausible. Propaganda then is an argument, often political, directed at a group’s ideology to achieve a certain end. Fields argues that “the most successful propagandist is one who thoroughly understands the ideology of those to be propagandized” (111). She provides the example of Southern secessionists in the Civil War, who appealed to non-slave-owners’ ideology of self-determination and independence in order to rally their support to fight for slavery in the name of protecting the Southern way of life. In the world of presidential politics that Didion describes, Fields’ definition of propaganda offers another way to read the tactics behind the images in the banal narrative.\r\n\r\nThe crux of Didion’s critique of the banal narrative is that while America faces a whole range of real issues and problems—the empirical reality of the country—the political class creates and debates a set of issues that nostalgically refer to an America that no longer exists. She describes Dukakis’ use of a snowblower to symbolize an “amusing frugality and…admirable husbandry of resources…derived from some half-remembered idea of what citizens of this vanished America had laughed at and admired” (78). Similarly, George Bush obscures his wealthy Connecticut upbringing by invoking the struggle of his young idyllic family to establish itself in 1950’s small-town Texas. Both candidates are crafting paeans to a gentler and safer time in an America of simple, homespun values. For Didion, “what was at work here seemed on the one hand a grave, although in many ways a comfortable, miscalculation of what people in America might have as their deepest concerns in 1988” (78). I would argue that rather than a miscalculation, grave or otherwise, this imagery is specifically calculated to capture a maximum of votes.\r\n\r\nIn using nostalgic imagery, the campaigns create propaganda that attempts to capture some important ideologies among the voting population: a desire for safety among a suburban middle-class that feels threatened by crime; a belief by union laborers that hard work and honesty are duly rewarded; or a longing among churchgoers for a return to a moral world before pornography and hedonism were rampant. One could analyze the campaign narratives as specifically directed at particular groups with strong ideologies, and the groups given preference would likely correspond to those who are most organized to vote, such as churches, unions, and the elderly. The fact that Didion finds these narratives so disingenuous and empty might also reflect her position as an outsider to the ideologies at which the narratives are directed. Within her social sphere, represented by the well-heeled liberal Californians who support Jesse Jackson in her essay—or perhaps the readers to whom she directs her assumptions about outsiders—these ideologies seem foolish and disconnected from present circumstances. But for the calculations of political strategy, where every vote is equal regardless of logical consistency, in these ideologies lies the power to move voter blocs in order to win election.\r\n\r\nDidion’s essay overstates the influence of a callow political media in draining the democratic process of citizen participation and substantive issues. As Sontag’s essay demonstrates, the shallow nature of the television medium and the accelerated glut of images over the last 35 years have led to a spectator public with far more interest in affecting images than substantive engagement and debate. Equally, Didion, for all of her beautifully crafted images and architectural sentences, fails to explore what is a vital element in any discussion of political campaigns: the game of politicians trying to move voters by any possible means to vote for them. Central to that process is ideology, as Fields defines it, embedded in social groups. While I personally agree with many of Didion’s democratic ideals and her desire for a more substantive political process, I think that her arguments reflect her own kind of nostalgia for a by-gone era: the street politics of the Sixties. Moreover, her lack of in-depth reporting about the outsiders she mythologizes reveals the romantic assumptions about the public of her own liberal intellectual milieu. The 1968 Democratic Convention was indeed a profound rupture in American political history, but its implications are not so simple as Didion’s dissent portrays it.', 'From Scuffling to Channel-Surfing: American Politics in the Television Age', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'from-scuffling-to-channel-surfing-american-politics-in-the-television-age', '', '', '2012-03-23 15:19:03', '2012-03-23 15:19:03', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=293', 0, 'essay', '', 0),
(408, 8, '2012-02-27 05:38:33', '2012-02-27 05:38:33', 'In the final section of her essay “Insider Baseball,” Joan Didion, after a wide-ranging discussion of the American political media, takes a curious detour to visit 544 Camp Street in New Orleans. Historically, the address was connected with Lee Harvey Oswald in the months before he assassinated President Kennedy, as well as being the site of numerous other subversive political activities. What seems at first like a non-sequitur in her narrative, however, upon closer examination develops into a carefully crafted image of the state of politics as Didion sees it. She asserts that the people who had gathered at 544 Camp Street, including and perhaps most of all Oswald, “had taken the American political narrative seriously…They had argued about it, fallen out over it, had hit each other over the head with pistol butts over it” (85). These subversives represent a passionate and combative engagement in politics that Didion sees missing in the consensus narratives that she critiques in the rest of her essay. When she arrives at 544 Camp, however, the building is gone, replaced by a federal courthouse. Nevertheless, she lingers listening to two anti-abortion protesters, described like grotesques of an old political type, the soapbox orator. A young man on a makeshift platform describes “unwanted babies being put down the Disposall and ‘clogging the main sewer drains of New Orleans,’” while the woman with him lip-synchs to a tape, singing “Satan–you''re the liar” (85).\r\n\r\nInto this eerie scene enters a presidential motorcade on its way to the nearby Republican convention. With the image of Lee Harvey Oswald still lingering in our minds, the scene as Didion describes it has seemingly deliberate overtones of the Kennedy assassination. With Didion on the corner watching, police and Secret Service line the streets, while she notices “a man in uniform on a roof” (86). As the “entirely and perfectly insulated” motorcade passes, Didion reflects on the moment, expressing the central theme of her essay:\r\n<blockquote>I stood for awhile on Camp Street, on this corner that might be construed as one of those occasional accidental intersections where the remote narrative had collided with the actual life of the country, and waited until the motorcade itself,…a mechanism dedicated like the process for which it stood only to the maintenance of itself, had passed. (86)</blockquote>\r\nUnlike Kennedy’s motorcade in Dallas, this motorcade passes safely, and obliviously. The political process, and the media which aid and abet it, are perfectly insulated from both the combative, subversive elements and the ideological grotesques that linger past and present in the “melancholy of Camp Street” (Didion 86). This is Didion’s central critique of what has become of presidential politics at the time of her writing in 1988. The democratic process, which she defines in the ideal as “the general mechanism affording citizens of a state a voice in its affairs” (49), has been replaced by a profoundly disconnected process in which media professionals, complicit with those in power, craft a political narrative remote “from the actual life of the country” (Didion 49-50). Her essay demonstrates in rich detail how this narrative is constructed and controlled, but I find myself wondering what for Didion is the “actual life of the country,” and why the mechanisms of democracy have become less combative and more disconnected from those outside of the political class.\r\n\r\nThe actual life of the country, or the empirical as Didion formulates it elsewhere, is in fact largely absent in her essay. The outsiders whom she describes are in one place quintessentially romantic outsiders whom Didion knew in her youth, “the people with whom I had preferred to spend time in high school” (47). Instead of attending elite schools and pursuing careers in Washington, these people “hung out in gas stations” (Didion 47), were drafted, ran off to Carson City to get married, and lived in tract houses on the social and economic edge of America. At other points in the essay, the actual America is a motley collection of types who appear at the fringe of political events Didion attends on the campaign trail. These include a slightly unhinged man at a Dukakis rally, some kids contrarily shouting for Jesse Jackson at another Dukakis event, and the aforementioned anti-abortion protesters. Didion also cites a few statistics to demonstrate the level of apathy among citizens. She notes that “only slightly more than half of those eligible to vote in the United States did vote in the 1984 presidential election” (50). She also points out the lack of viewership of political conventions, as 80 percent of television households did not watch these conventions in 1988. Besides these meager examples, though some are evocative and colorful to be sure, it is hard to locate in her essay a substantive picture of what the empirical realities of America look like. They are largely assumed to be familiar to the reader, or are invoked rhetorically in contrast to the insiders of the political class. In a sense, her outsiders remain in the rhetorical realm of “out there,” without any evident reporting or research to bring them into better focus.\r\n\r\nBut if we allow for Didion''s broad-stroke portrait of the disaffected citizenry, how does she account for the change in the process? As she sees it, the defining moment when combative politics began the movement towards consensus centrist politics was the Democratic Convention of 1968, when street protests outside the convention disrupted the attempt at order going on within. This event exists in the same realm as the Camp Street brawlers: a time when “the process was put to a popular vote on the streets of Chicago” (72). Rather than feeling apathetic, she implies, people outside of the political class were engaged and active in having their say. As a result, “it was decided that what had occurred could not be allowed to recur” (Didion 72). The power and motive behind this change is described thus by Didion:\r\n<blockquote>David S. Broder, in the Washington Post, offered this compelling analysis of the power these “reforms” in the nominating procedure had vested not in the party leadership, which is where the power of choice ultimately resides, but in “the existing communication system,” by which he meant the press, the medium through which the party leadership sells its choice. (72)</blockquote>\r\nBroder’s analysis describes the multiplication of party primaries, and a resulting proliferation in coverage of those primaries, which leads to the state of affairs Didion portrays: vapid, ceremonial political conventions devoid of any real contention. Didion implies in the phrase “it was decided” that the powers-that-be, presumably the party leaders, decided to complicate the primary process in order to prevent unrest like that at the ’68 Convention. In so doing, they invested the media with the power to dumb down debate to the point that the leaders’ choice is the only choice. But it is difficult here to identify how much of this change was intended or planned by those leaders, and how much was a larger evolution of politics and technology taking place beyond specific agency. Did the party leaders and the complicit media create this new process, or did they adapt to a new technological landscape?\r\n\r\nSusan Sontag, in her 2002 essay “Looking at War,” proposes two theories about the impact of the media in general, and television specifically, on the viewing public. In several ways, Sontag corroborates Didion''s thesis of a pervasive media narrative leading to a disconnected citizenry. On the one hand, Sontag argues, “public attention is steered by the attentions of the media” (96). Wherever the media tell us to look becomes the reality we know. But simultaneously, the sheer saturation of these images leads to a deadening effect. So while an event is made more real by its coverage, the overall glut of images leads to a lesser impact. Sontag further defines the nature of this image-glut as an integral aspect of the medium of television: “television is organized to arouse and to satiate, by its surfeit of images. Image-glut keeps attention light, mobile, relatively indifferent to content” (96). Thus, in relation to Didion’s subject, the political media craft their banal narrative, creating “reality” for the public. But the narrative is banal, lacking “a more reflective engagement with content” as Sontag puts it, precisely because of television''s tendency to glide over meaningful content (96).

In her mind, a reality does exist independent of the images, but the “sense of reality” has been eroded, and the public has been increasingly reduced to mere spectators.\r\n\r\nIn general, Didion and Sontag would seem to agree on the general nature of the change in political engagement.

(294, 5, '2011-12-19 08:01:59', '2011-12-19 08:01:59', 'The clickety-click of the departures sign cuts through the continuous murmur, as three trains switch to status “boarding.” I am overwhelmed by the sounds of the stampede of travelers rushing to get in line, a noise that begins to die down as the travelers feed into the descending escalators at the edges of the large room. Off the newly evacuated floors of Penn Station emerges a couple in their eighties, inching their way towards the tall information man standing to my right. The old man sports a freshly bought baseball cap with a crisp brim and an emblem that I do not recognize. It sits awkwardly on his head, too much space left at the top. I know that he has never worn a hat before.\r\n\r\nFinally, the couple reaches the information man, and the husband takes a step forward, looking back at his wife a few times for reassurance. No words are spoken. All that I hear is the annoying static coming from the walkie-talkie attached to the information man’s waist. The old man continues to look back and forth from his wife to the intimidating stranger in front of him. I wait for a line of encouragement from the information man, a simple “Can I help you?” to relieve the obvious difficulty of this encounter. I grow angry at his unnecessary exertion of the little authority he has. The silence is eventually broken when the old man takes out his ticket, and pointing to it, says in broken English (it sounds like he is Hispanic),\r\n\r\n“I want to take this to Secaucus.”\r\n\r\n“Track 6,” says the information guard. This is his favorite terse reply.\r\n\r\nThe old man looks down at his ticket, “I also wanted…” but the information man has already turned his back, ignoring the request. We wait in vain for him to turn around. Defeated, the old man turns back to his wife. She motions a “Well? Go on…” gesture, the kind that mothers make when their sons are too scared to pay for candy at the register on their own. Gathering up what is left of his confidence, the old man speaks thickly to the information man’s back: “Where is track 6?” The information man turns around, and heaving a sigh of aggravation, points in the direction of the track. “Thank you,” the old man nods excessively and walks towards the gate with his wife.\r\n\r\nI look back at the information man, who now shifts the weight back and forth from his heels to the balls of his feet. I try to detect any sign of remorse, but my attempts are futile, and soon I am wracked with a new preoccupation. I have always been aware of the diversity that makes up New York, and I had always believed that there was something about being a New Yorker that bridged the differences between diverse groups. But as I reflected on the way in which the information man purposely created distance between himself and the old Hispanic man, I began to see a different reality: perhaps New Yorkers create division between groups and establish an “other” (a person or group that opposes a certain ideal) as a tool of successful living. But what is in the nature of “otherness” and in the nature of New York and its citizens that calls for this division? And what are the consequences, for both society and the individual, of acknowledging “otherness”?\r\n\r\nMy wishes for the interaction between these two men may very well seem overly romantic for what was just a momentary encounter in Penn Station. But I cannot help but think that my longing for contact is a natural feeling in this enormous and often cold city. In her essay “The Use of Sidewalks: Contact,” Jane Jacobs recognizes city dwellers'' “wishes for differing degrees of contact” as a catalyst for the social interactions among them (77-78). She asserts that the best kind of public contact arises in public settings, (sidewalks, for example), and emphasizes the futility and danger of attempting to achieve public contact through private interaction: “ ‘Togetherness’ is a fittingly nauseating name for an old ideal in planning theory…The requirement that much shall be shared drives city people apart” (Jacobs 81). Jacobs’s disdain for private contact in the public sphere is highlighted through her example of a street in Baltimore that has no sidewalk public life and instead uses a sidewalk park as a primary location for private contact:\r\n<blockquote>Still more distressing, when mothers of different income or color or educational background bring their children to the street park, they and their children are rudely and pointedly ostracized. They fit awkwardly into the suburbanlike sharing of private lives that has grown in default of city sidewalk life. The park lacks benches purposely; the “togetherness” people ruled them out because they might be interpreted as an invitation to people who cannot fit in. (Jacobs 83)</blockquote>\r\nThe words “rudely,” “pointedly,” and “ostracized” transform what might have been perceived as a mere distaste for “togetherness” into an unsettling representation of the discrimination that can arise out of this ideal. Jacobs''s representation of the benchless park emphasizes the thick irony of the exclusive “togetherness” of this Baltimore street. She senses the phoniness of this planned utopia, the manner in which by choosing to exclude members from its inclusive neighborhood, the inhabitants of these residences are in essence cheating, making the process of togetherness easier by avoiding the inherent difficulty of co-existence. By establishing the “other,” and making their inclusiveness exclusive, the residents achieve a powerful sense of belonging.\r\n\r\nAs I imagine this mother wheeling a stroller into the park, her clothes, her voice, her hair and her make-up a stark contrast to the park’s everyday visitors, I am reminded of the old-Hispanic man with his broken English and too-new hat. I think of the “togetherness” people in the park, rudely complacent, and am reminded of the information man, who seemed to take advantage of the old man’s “otherness.” It is the old man and the visiting mother that give the information man and the Baltimore residents the identity they long for. As long as the former (out of place and visibly awkward) is present, the latter can exert the little authority they have and celebrate their comfortable position of belonging. The suffering of the excluded “other” becomes a necessary component of the “togetherness” people’s contentment.\r\n\r\nLike Jacobs, Joan Didion finds that the employment of the “other” masks unpleasant truths by establishing clear-cut, opposing forces. Didion argues, however, that the dangers of this concealment go beyond divisiveness and discrimination. In her essay “Sentimental Journeys,” she carefully examines the “sentimental narratives” (faulty and manipulative representations of public conflicts) that serve to “personalize and obscure” the real problems at the source of the city’s disorder (Didion 275). Presenting the case of Trisha Meili, the “Central Park Jogger” who was raped in 1989, Didion argues that the success of the case’s narratives arose out of the personalized and contrasting representations of the victim and her alleged attackers. She presents various headlines of newspapers following the case, “Teen Wolfpack Beats and Rapes Wall Street Exec on Jogging Path. Wolf Pack’s Prey. Female Jogger Near Death After Savage Attack by Roving Gang” (Didion 255), depicting the press’ insensitive portrayal of a helpless victim and the ravenous animals that allegedly attacked her.\r\n\r\nIn the simple narratives that evolved, the jogger became the image of everything that was right in the city (the “well-brought-up virgin,” the ivy graduate, the Wall-Street executive). The accused “by contrast, were seen as incapable of appreciating these marginal distinctions, ignorant of both the norms and accoutrements of middle-class life” (Didion 272). For the narrative to capture the peoples’ attention, it was not enough that the victim was the embodiment of success in the city. There had to be an opposing force, a person or group that challenged that ideal, so that the narrative could be distilled into a simple problem of good vs. evil, easily accessible to the citizens of New York.\r\n\r\nTwo "opposing visions” emerged. One “was of a city systematically ruined, violated, raped by its underclass. The [other]…was of a city in which the powerless had been systematically ruined, violated, raped by the powerful” (Didion 300). In using the exact same adjectives Didion illustrates that both opposing visions are as narrow as the narratives that sparked them. The personalization in the case of the Central Park Jogger allowed these groups to simplify the issues of race into problems of ravenous wolves and their prey. In doing so they were able to not only mask the complexities of the case, but also the economic crisis that was wrenching the city. The establishment of the “other” allowed New Yorkers to avoid confronting the real problems at the source of the city’s disorder, turning their attention instead to concerns that already had a set vocabulary and a familiar narrative and could thus be easily manipulated into the uncomplicated subjects that they were willing to address.\r\n\r\nDidion’s concept of “sentimental narratives” is also reflected in James Baldwin’s “Notes of a Native Son,” a personal essay in which he paints with heart-wrenching detail his experience of growing up as an African-American in the 1940s. In his retelling of the incident that sparked the Harlem riots (a black soldier’s fight with a white policeman over a black woman that resulted in the shooting of the black soldier), Baldwin emphasizes that the story that spread throughout Harlem held little merit. He writes, “The facts were somewhat different—for example, the soldier had not been shot in the back, and was not dead, and the girl seems to have been as dubious a symbol of womanhood as her white counterpart in Georgia usually is” (Baldwin 110). This narrative, he suggests became a popular favorite among the inhabitants of Harlem because, “This invention expressed and corroborated their hates and fears so perfectly” (Baldwin 110). The similarity between the woman in Harlem and the Central Park Jogger moves beyond their common role of victim. Their glorified representations in their respective stories depict the “invention” that Baldwin offers as his own “sentimental narrative.” The personalization of the black woman as a chaste victim and the policeman as the “other”—and consequently the implicit distinction between black and white, good and evil—once again made the case into an accessible narrative for the silenced voice that had been waiting for a chance to speak. The story thus transformed into whatever the public wanted it to represent, the embodiment of the problems they were longing to address.\r\n\r\nBaldwin also emphasizes that the popularity of these narratives is largely due to their ability to obscure personal strife. The establishment of the other created an environment where hate could be expressed freely, and sorrow driven into obscurity: “I imagine that one of the reasons people cling to their hates so stubbornly is because they sense, once hate is gone, that they will be forced to deal with pain” (Baldwin 101). Like Didion, Baldwin illustrates how the narrative of the “other” allowed the people of Harlem to address their problems superficially, avoiding the internal pain that was at the root of their suffering. It was imagined, perhaps, that if the pain was simply ignored, or transferred into rage, it would begin to go away. Instead, the hate became a destructive force and served only to exacerbate the pain.\r\n\r\nDespite these apparent similarities, however, Baldwin speaks of “otherness” in a way that sounds very little like Didion. He writes about acknowledging “otherness” from the perspective of an “other” and thus brings new dimensions to the meaning of the word. When he walks down the street after his confrontational interaction with a waitress, he becomes overwhelmed by his awareness of the differences that separate him from those around him: “People were moving in every direction but it seemed to me, in that instant, that all of the people I could see, and many more than that, were moving toward me, against me, and that everyone was white. I remember how their faces gleamed” (Baldwin 95). This is not the same “otherness” illustrated in Penn Station, a Baltimore sidewalk park, or the headlines of New York City newspapers. The “others” that Baldwin sees are not ostracized because they are different together; they are the majority. Baldwin, by contrast, represents the minority. Everyone walks together and “against” him, as he stands alone. He thus shares in the otherness of the old Hispanic man in Penn Station, the alleged rapists, and the awkward mother standing defenseless before the “togetherness” group.\r\n\r\nBaldwin’s perspective raises a consciousness that is not found in any of the other essays. The duality of his identity, expressed using a poignant first-person narrative, brings an added intimacy to his writing and allows him to articulate a vivid and convincing illustration of the dangers and pain that accompany “otherness.” His writing exposes the conflict of a man deeply embedded in the subject he addresses, lacking the easy escape or comfortable distance that Jacobs, Didion, and I used to our advantage in our analysis of otherness. When I witnessed the episode in Penn Station, my pity emphasized the vast difference between the old-Hispanic man and myself. I could situate myself above him, looking down upon his personal struggle; take my acknowledgment of otherness and move on, perhaps forget about it in a couple hours and then revisit it later in writing. When Baldwin sees otherness in the white people that surround him, the results are far more consequential, for he sees the otherness that they see in him. The words “rage,” “anger,” “disease,” “poison,” and “hate” permeate his essay, rendering it with living emotion and urgency and conveying the almost incomprehensible burden of what it means to be the “other.” Baldwin’s writing thus exposes the true devastation that arises out of the creation of “otherness” in New York City.\r\n\r\nIt is thus the combinations of a large and indifferent city and its lonely inhabitants looking for belonging, overwhelmingly broad problems of race and economic crisis and fear of confrontation, and perhaps even a fear of the otherness that we see in ourselves that leads New Yorkers to establish a divide between themselves and the person or group that to them represents the “other.” In this vast and complicated metropolis it seems that the “other” has thrived in its ability to simultaneously include and exclude, reveal and obscure, for its multifaceted nature matches the multifaceted demands of the New York City citizens.', 'Acknowledging Otherness', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'acknowledging-otherness-2', '', '', '2012-04-10 15:43:41', '2012-04-10 15:43:41', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=294', 0, 'essay', '', 0);

(295, 5, '2011-12-19 08:03:19', '2011-12-19 08:03:19', 'Though seldom mentioned by American politicians and news media, the world is still recovering from the worst ecological disaster to occur in modern Europe. On November 13, 2002, the Prestige, a Greek-owned tanker carrying 84,849 tons of oil, began to fracture in choppy seas off the coast of Spain. As the leaking vessel began to slowly sink, the Dutch salvage company in charge of its rescue requested that the Prestige be towed to a small bay where the spill could be contained. After Spain refused to allow the tanker near its coast, Portugal dispatched a warship to ensure, unequivocally, that the Prestige would find no shelter in its territorial waters. Several days of debate produced a solution mutually agreed upon by the various European countries involved: tow the Prestige to Africa (Tremlett). Unfortunately for the European community, the decision was made too late— they were unable to export their problem to the developing world. The crippled boat had become completely submerged and strong currents and winds had spread oil across nearly two-hundred miles of shoreline. Since the tragedy, the once commercially viable fishing and shellfish industry has been decimated by toxic pollutants, more than 300,000 seabirds have died, and up to 24,000 tons of oil still floats in slicks off the Spanish, French, and English coasts (Brown and Tremlett).\r\n\r\nTransporting petroleum products by sea is an extraordinarily hazardous business, particularly considering that two-thirds of the world’s oil tankers have the older single-hull design, like the Prestige (Adams). The more modern double-hull tankers offer some protection from spills, but many countries, like Russia, have yet to begin replacing older ships which the International Maritime Organization has required to be phased out by 2015 (Brown). Even with the limited protection provided by a double-hull, spills are bound to happen. The four major cleanup methods—containment, skimming, solvents, and burning— are poor at best. Containment by floating barriers fails in rough seas, skimming only recovers oil from the water’s surface, solvents come with their own potential for ecological damage, and burning causes terrible air pollution (Adams). The reality is that the more oil we ship across the ocean, the more we increase the chances of catastrophe.\r\n\r\nSadly, the dangers involved in the international petroleum business are not restricted to transport; the dangers include hostile geo-political relations. Yet, blaming the oil industry for current American aggression in the Middle East does nothing to reduce the underlying issues surrounding this international conflict. “Blood for oil” may be a catchy slogan and it may be justified, but adopting platitudes fails to answer the why. The core of this question centers on individual responsibility and the environment. In war and the global ecosystem, why is there an “us” and a “them”? In order to respond to this question it becomes necessary to examine the actions of, not simply our military, but all personnel presently conducting business abroad which could affect ecological or political stability.\r\n\r\nForeign governments’ environmental restrictions on oil operations pale in comparison to those of the United States. Multinational corporations embrace these lax regulations overseas as a means to save money. However, cutting corners financially has resulted in dire consequences ecologically. In Ecuador, for example, an ongoing lawsuit has accused ChevronTexaco of polluting 2.5 million acres of rainforest. Rather than properly disposing of toxic waste, ChevronTexaco discharged up to four million gallons a day of heavy-metal contaminated wastewater directly into the Amazon wetlands. Additionally, they discarded liquid drilling waste in hundreds of open, unlined pits, near dozens of indigenous villages (Vidal). In the United States, these would have been flagrant environmental violations leading to criminal prosecutions. In Ecuador, ChevronTexaco saved four billion dollars and may eventually have to pay minor reparations. With no rules governing global drilling operations, the oil industry has no incentive to respect fragile environments abroad.\r\n\r\nIt’s unfortunate we need the oil industry at all, but consumption of oil and gas in the United States continues to rise. Even if we assume that the tireless efforts of conservationists will succeed and hydrocarbon usage will not increase, our current level of consumption is staggering. The United States makes up less than five percent of the world’s population, yet we devour more than twenty-five percent of its petroleum (NationMaster). Annually, slightly more than half of the oil we burn through is imported. Virtually all of this imported crude is produced in countries with substandard environmental regulations and then shipped via tanker to the United States. In order to minimize damage to the global ecosystem, petroleum production must be conducted under strictly controlled conditions and transport across oceans must be curtailed.\r\n\r\nEnvironmentalists unanimously agree that any drilling operations should be executed with absolute care. The problem is, realistically, there are very few places where production can be rigorously controlled. Compounding this, the few nations who demand corporations comply with strict environmental guidelines also seem to hold fast to the contradictory ideal: “Not in my backyard.” Crowds cheer outside a courthouse after an injunction is handed down blocking an oil company from drilling in their area. The people, proud they were able to protect their community, return to normal life without a thought to the consequences of their actions. The oil industry is constantly searching for more production; when they are denied in one region it is easy to find another where the locals do not have access to the same time, education, and finances that would allow them to fully comprehend the potential harm to their environment. Don’t all people, regardless of background, deserve the same protections for their land and waterways?\r\n\r\nApparently in Russia, they do not. Sakhalin Island is at the far northeast corner of Russia. After repeatedly being denied drilling permits on federal land in Alaska, ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch/Shell simply sought a target that most similarly matched the Alaskan coast in reservoir volume and geology. In this case, the target happened to lie directly across the bay on Sakhalin Island, Russia. Of course, Sakhalin is not protected by the same environmental rules that govern Alaska.\r\n\r\n<em>The</em> <em>Wall Street Journal</em>’s Jim Carlton said of the situation, “Therein lies a global tradeoff: As environmental groups scramble to shield one piece of the planet from oil exploration, the drilling rigs pop up on another sensitive front.” Since the start of the Sakhalin project, ExxonMobil has allowed seismic blasting within 2.5 miles of endangered gray whales. In Alaska, a 12-mile buffer is enforced to keep from driving the whales away from migratory routes and feeding grounds. Shell regularly discharges toxic drilling muds into shallow ocean water. All such dumping is prohibited in Alaska to protect marine life.\r\n\r\nTo date, neither company has put forth any method to protect salmon from pipeline discharges, while a specific plan is required in the United States. Perhaps most disturbing is that multinationals transport the oil, by tanker, through the Tartar Straits in winter broken-ice conditions. In 2000, Alaska forced the oil industry to run spill cleanup tests in broken-ice— the corporations failed every test. Since then, tanker transport in Alaska, minimal already as a result of extensive pipeline infrastructure, is halted during broken-ice conditions (Carlton). Ultimately, the perpetuation of environmental nationalism contradicts the realities of a global ecosystem. In order to stop the “global tradeoff,” we must direct the resource industry to locations with the most rigid environmental laws.\r\n\r\nThe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is one such location. To clarify, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, or ANWR, encompasses 19.5 million-acres of Alaska’s northeast corner. The sole area that has ever been discussed as a possible exploration target is the ANWR’s 1.5 million-acre coastal strip. The last plan debated proposed opening seven percent of the ANWR for drilling. Most environmental organizations estimate the reserves at around 3.2 billion barrels of oil, whereas industry studies put the number at 16 billion barrels. Using just the low-end figure, the United States could replace six years crude oil supply from our largest and most contentious importing region— the Middle East (ANWR).\r\n\r\nThe ANWR makes an ideal site not only due to its substantial reserves, but because public concern would force all drilling operations to be conducted under an environmental microscope. In fact, the state of Alaska proudly proclaims the environmental restrictions it places on the petroleum industry are the “most heavily regulated in the world” (ANWR). However, in addition to volume and environmental standards, there is one other factor that must be considered in this particular area— the opinion of the Native Americans who live there.\r\n\r\nThe Eskimos are the lone inhabitants of the ANWR, and although some individual tribes dissent, most support opening up their lands to drilling. Nicholas D. Kristof, of the <em>New York Times</em>, summed up the Eskimo’s sentiments after spending a week in the ANWR, “Some resent the idea that American environmentalists 5,000 miles away want to lock them forever in a quaint wilderness, just for the psychic value of knowing that it is there.” As Kristof discovered, Alaska’s indigenous community sees oil drilling as a means to achieve better schools and more jobs. They are upset that people who live elsewhere deny them access to more comfortable lives. The Eskimos are no strangers to petroleum as oil has pooled in patches along their coastal lands for thousands of years. In an interview with an Eskimo tribesman, Kristof states that Bert Akootchoot “angrily told me that if environmentalists were so anxious about the Arctic, they should come here and clean up the petroleum that naturally seeps to the surface of the tundra.” The human factor, particularly from a too often ignored population segment, lends credible weight to the already sound argument in favor of oil drilling in the ANWR.\r\n\r\nThe ANWR’s oil could be best leveraged by coupling it with a substantial source of natural gas in order to ensure the United States lasting sovereignty as an energy producer. Gas is rapidly becoming the more important resource as the United States shifts its energy policies. Ninety percent of all new power plants in the United States will utilize natural gas (Raabe). Yet, many existing gas plants, particularly in California, currently operate at less than full capacity due to a shortage in supply. Trends among electricity producers suggest a steadily increasing demand for natural gas. This is good news for the environment since gas burns far cleaner than coal or oil. Moreover, by furthering our reliance on gas, we decrease dependence on foreign nations for oil. The question then becomes, where will this gas come from? The Rocky Mountain Front is estimated to contain 2.2 trillion cubic feet of gas (Herring). That’s roughly forty-one percent of the gas reserves in the United States. Most of it lies beneath federal lands: Glacier National Park, the Scapegoat Wilderness Area, and the Lewis and Clark reserve. For the moment, these lands are completely closed to drilling.\r\n\r\nThe argument for drilling in the Rocky Mountain Front is similar to that of the ANWR. However, it is worth mentioning the significant technological improvements that make drilling, particularly for gas, more friendly to the environment. Directional drilling allows multiple wells to be drilled from one location. Prior to directional drilling, each well would need its own well-bore and ground level pad with associated machinery. Gas wells, which are generally much deeper than oil wells, require enormous drilling rigs which initially had to be moved around from one pad to the next.\r\n\r\nAll of this contributed to far more clutter above and below ground. Now, rigs are often fixed to a particular location, much like an offshore platform. This drastically cuts down on subterranean ecological damage and also reduces the surface drilling area to a fraction of its original size. In turn, this provides drilling operators a much better opportunity to hide their equipment, thus minimizing the negative impact on wilderness scenery. The aesthetics of the Rocky Mountain Front are, understandably, of great concern to those who live in the surrounding region. Yet, there is more at stake than just aesthetics, and unlike Alaska’s ANWR, the Rocky Mountain community is split on whether to allow drilling or not.\r\n\r\nA large portion of the population in and immediately adjacent to the Rocky Mountain Front’s federal lands fall into two demographics: poor working class families or wealthy landowners. The working class fills the industrial labor jobs in mills, mines, quarries, and the like. The wealthy are mostly vacation home owners with mountain escapes. Not surprisingly, the poor favor drilling since its revenues will likely lend their communities a much needed economic boost. Nonprofit groups advocating the development of federal land support these local economic interests with appeals to the national concern regarding consumption.\r\n\r\nClaire Moseley of Public Lands Advocacy, a grassroots organization formed by local laborers, recently said of the Rocky Mountain National Front, “We think it is one of the most important reserves in the country… and it makes no sense to set it aside when we are facing natural gas shortages” (Herring). The potential positive effects on the lives of their neighbors and on the nation’s energy supply fail to influence the wealthy part-time residents who continue to oppose any drilling outright. Undoubtedly, they would grumble if their home/private ski lodge had no heat to keep their guests warm or no lights to distinguish the scotch from the bourbon. At the same time, the thought of oil drilling near their pristine manicured landscape would most certainly elicit the familiar response, “Not in my backyard.” Consequently, for the moment, the Rocky Mountain Front’s local population stands at an impasse.\r\n\r\nToo often the debate regarding domestic drilling is stalemated because no room is left for compromise. Proposed policies seem to be one extreme or the other. The environmentalists oppose all drilling period, while the energy industry wants complete autonomy to drill anywhere. This issue is not so black and white; the solution is dependant on finding a middle ground. A plan must be formulated which benefits both sides without antagonizing the opposition. Industry could be allowed careful exploration in the ANWR and the Rocky Mountain Front, potentially followed by limited commercial drilling. In exchange, there should be an increase in carbon emissions standards, major additional funding for studies on renewable energy, incentives for corporations who produce energy saving products, and more stringent vehicle mileage requirements.\r\n\r\nThis line of thinking is slowly gaining support. Yale’s esteemed environmental law professor, Daniel Esty, has proposed a similar policy and other academics are beginning to investigate taking a middle-of-the-road stance (Kristof). Nationally, the benefits to this approach would include a decline in air pollution, real advances in the pursuit for “clean” power, a reduction in electricity and fuel consumption, and most significantly, decreased reliance on foreign oil imports.\r\n\r\nInternationally, it is essential that we reach an agreement on this issue since the United States foreign policy is and is perceived to be dictated by our energy policy. Going back several decades, all our presidential administrations have made securing resources a strategic priority. In 1980, Jimmy Carter said that any attempt to impede the flow of oil in the Persian Gulf would be regarded as an “assault on the vital interests of the United States,” and would be “repelled by any means necessary, including military force.” More recently, an energy review, launched by Dick Cheney in May 2002, recommended to President Bush that he “make energy security a priority of our trade and foreign policy” (Vidal). Regardless of how intertwined these policies actually are, foreign nations, particularly in the Middle East, believe petroleum to be the key catalyst for United States military action.\r\n\r\nJust over a year ago,<em> The Brookings Review</em> published a survey conducted in six Arab countries by Shibley Telhami, professor for Peace and Development at the University of Maryland, which found that an overwhelming majority of those polled expressed a negative opinion of the United States. The respondents explained that their view was based on American policy in the Middle East. When asked what motivates this policy, eighty percent answered “oil.” The answers given least frequently were: “democracy, economic development, or peace.” Without altering this viewpoint, there remains a worldwide threat of conflict, as evidenced by the ongoing wars in eight of the top twelve nations with the most proven oil reserves (Vidal). This perceived connection, between foreign policy and energy, is not limited to an international audience.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, beginning January 2003, a series of television commercials proposed a link between geo-political instability and petroleum. One of the ads went as follows: A man is shown filling up his vehicle while a child’s voice says: “This is George. This is the gas that George bought for his SUV.” A map of the Middle East showing Iraq and Saudi Arabia appears and the voice-over continues: “These are the countries where the executives bought the oil that made the gas.” Over a shot of a terrorist training camp, it says: “And these are the terrorists who get money from those countries every time George fills up his SUV.” (Campbell)\r\n\r\nWhile the specific logic depicted in this commercial can be argued, it demonstrates that an association exists here in the United States. Popular perception ties international conflict to America’s relationship with the environment, and generally speaking this is not too far from the truth. Through war and through oil excavation and transport practices, the world’s ecosystem and its people are harmed. In the United States, we have the means to reduce the chance of international disaster by working together. Environmentalists and the petroleum industry must set aside their differences and compromise. Additionally, Americans must remember that though we may be a part of a neighborhood, a city, a state, and a country, we are also a part of the global community. Now more than ever, the United States is interconnected with the worldwide economy and environment. There is no escaping the repercussions of global mismanagement. Given America’s high consumption and low production, it must seem insulting to use force or support environmental damage in other countries to obtain energy. It is not worth preserving our land if we destroy someone else’s. After all, the Earth is everyone’s backyard.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'A Hostile Environment:The Pursuit of Oil in a Global Age', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'a-hostile-environmentthe-pursuit-of-oil-in-a-global-age-2', '', '', '2012-04-10 15:42:42', '2012-04-10 15:42:42', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=295', 0, 'essay', '', 0),
(297, 8, '2012-03-22 19:56:57', '2012-03-22 19:56:57', 'From April through mid-July of 1994, the small African nation of Rwanda was the site of nearly one million systematic murders of men, women, and children suspected to be ethnically Tutsi, Tutsi supporters, or otherwise threats to the government. In the aftermath of the genocide, academics have theorized a variety of explanations for how high unemployment, extreme poverty, and political instability combined to cause “the Hutus” to take revenge on “the Tutsis” through violence and murder . Yet these daunting numbers and totalizing statistics create an image of two distinct factions blindly attacking each other, which is far from the reality of the situation. Carried out mostly by machete and through local militias, the Rwandan genocide is perhaps one of the most personal (that is, intimate) in history. It follows that, to truly understand the genocide’s cause, one must examine the mentality of Rwandans on the individual level at the time.\n\nIn the 1960s, psychologist Stanley Milgram was also interested in understanding obedience and its role in the Holocaust. He theorized that the power of authority plays a large role in coercing individuals to action and therefore conducted a series of experiments at Yale University aimed to answer the question, “How does a man behave when he is told by a legitimate authority to act against a third individual?” (Milgram 4). While the environment in which genocide takes place may be drastically different from the laboratory of Milgram’s experiments, the fundamental question I have cited remains the same. Significantly, Milgram’s findings have traditionally been written about with a strongly individualized approach, highlighting excerpts of debriefings and analyzing how the background of particular participants influenced their thinking. On the other hand, the Rwandan genocide has historically been represented as a conflict between two homogeneous groups. By juxtaposing findings from the Milgram experiment with the individual stories of two Hutus – one who resisted calls to violence and one who obeyed them – I hope to create a gateway through which we can come closer to realizing the complex factors surrounding each Rwandan’s choice of actions on the eve of genocide. While high-level administrators engineered the violence “to resist political change which they perceived as threatening”, the immediate actors carrying it out had far different motivations, ranging from misplaced morality to group conformity (Prunier 242).\n\nIn April 1994, seven Tutsi pastors wrote a desperate letter to their superior Pastor Elizaphan Ntakirutimana from the confines of their church complex in the Kibuyu region of Rwanda. It stated, among other things, “We wish to inform you that […] tomorrow we will be killed along with our families” (Gourevich 42). Ethnically Hutu, Pastor Ntakirutimana had distinguished himself at the outbreak of fighting by encouraging the local hidden Tutsi population to find shelter in his building, yet quickly his followers began to feel deceived. Pastor Ntakirutimana and his son were frequently seen conversing with the Hutu Power militia and Presidential Guard, and eventually it was his son who announced their execution date. In response to their letter, one survivor recalls, the Pastor wrote “Your problem has already found a solution. You must die” while another remembers, “You must be eliminated. God no longer wants you” (Gourevich 28). On April 16, 1994, Hutu military entered the supposed sanctuary and indiscriminately slaughtered nearly all 8,000 refugees – men, women, and children – in the church and hospital complex of Mugonero. The few who survived succeeded only by concealing themselves under corpses and fleeing after dark.\n\nIn the same month that Pastor Ntakirutimana delivered his refugees into the hands of the Hutu military, Paul Rusesabagina, an ethnic Hutu and temporary manager of the upscale Hotel des Milles Collines faced a decision of his own. Beginning April 7, this international tourist destination had been flooded with Tutsi and anti-Hutu Power supporters fearing for their lives (“Leave”). From the beginning, “Rusesabagina spent his days buying lives of Tutsis with liquor, reasoning, persuading, so that each band of killers who came to the hotel to take out various Tutsis on their lists for killing somehow ended up going away” (“Share”). Through newspaper interviews and telephone calls to leaders in Belgium and the United States, Rusesabagina secured National Police protection of his hotel. In two separate incidents, officials of the Department of Military Intelligence informed Rusesabagina that his occupants would be massacred by day’s end, and to evict them as soon as possible. Not bowing to the pressure, he instead contacted the French Foreign Ministry using a hidden fax line to inform and pressure the United Nations about the threats. Both times the situation was diffused. At the end of the hundred days of genocide, all his guests had survived unharmed, and Rusesabagina has become synonymous with heroism during the Rwandan genocide.\n\nMilgram’s experiment on obedience serves as the central point of analysis for both Rusesabagina and Pastor Ntakirutimana in this paper, so let us first describe its method. In Milgram’s experiment, volunteers in the lab were introduced to another supposed volunteer who was actually a confederate of Milgram’s. Through a rigged drawing, the volunteer would be designated the “teacher” while the confederate actor would be the “learner.” The teacher, after being given a sample 45-volt electrical shock, was given a list of questions to ask and instructed to give the learner increasing levels of electrical shock for incorrect answers by pushing a switch on a generator. The switch panel was labeled with voltages from 15 (“SLIGHT SHOCK”) to 450 volts (“XX”). Unbeknownst to him, the machine did not function. The learner was hidden from view in a room next door, and as the shock level increased, he would begin to complain of the pain until eventually demanding to be let out, screaming, and falling silent with no response, which was treated as a wrong answer. Contrary to the expectations of psychologists Milgram polled beforehand, a stunning 65 percent of subjects completed the experiment, “delivering” lethal 450-volt shocks. In order to fully understand what the experiment tells us about how Rwandans could become killers of their own neighbors, we must look closer at the ways in which subjects read various messages into the experimental procedure, allowing obedience to become easier.\n\nIn response to the first three protests by the teacher to stop the experiment, experimenters were directed to say, “The experiment requires that you continue” (Milgram 21), thus implicitly placing responsibility on neither himself nor the volunteer but rather the name of science. Misplaced responsibility is exactly what allowed Milgram’s subjects – and many who participated in the Rwandan genocide – to continue. As Milgram reasons: “Most subjects in the experiment see their behavior in a larger context that is benevolent and useful to society – the pursuit of scientific truth” (9). A source as impartial as science is not likely to purposefully endanger lives, and thus many volunteers dutifully continued. Placed in a similar situation being demanded by the government to murder known Tutsis, “[m]any Rwandans say that they killed because authorities told them to kill” (“Leave”). Indeed, for months a barrage of radio and other government-controlled media reports expounded upon the evils of the Tutsi ethnic group and “involved explicit and regular incitations to mass murder, constant verbal attacks on Tutsi, the publication of lists with the names of hundreds of people-to-be-killed, threats to anyone having relations with Tutsi, etc” (Uvin 110). Having been subjected to such discourse every day, Pastor Ntakirutimana came to give in to its call. Furthermore, whereas Milgram’s subjects faced no actual physical threat if they were to end the experiment, the pastor very well could have jeopardized his life by not turning his church over to the militia. Not satisfied with the response from its regular military members, the government also created “civilian self-defense” militias which armed and trained ordinary citizens and then ordered them to kill the Tutsi and their Hutu sympathizers. For some perpetrators of the genocide, the prospect of increasing their own wellbeing or that or their nation overall through displacement of Tutsis was a large draw.\n\nNeither were the killers in Rwanda as devoid of morality as they seemed, a fact illustrated by Milgram’s volunteers who readily accepted that the experimenter would be responsible for the learner’s injuries. Volunteers, assured that they were not at fault, felt themselves protected in their actions and continued with less guilt. Many Hutu militia members and other participants in the Rwandan killings have also frequently insisted they were merely carrying out orders handed down from above, an mindset easier to understand when viewed in light of pre-colonial Rwanda’s “strong tradition of unquestioning obedience to authority” that was “reinforced by both the German and the Belgian colonial administrations” (Prunier 241-42). In his own defense, Pastor Ntakirutimana himself claimed to be helpless in the face of authority. Though the church complex was his own, when the mayor of Mugonero said there was nothing to be done, he believed him and fled (Gourevich 41). Although legally, the experimenter’s culpability and the Rwandans’ powerlessness against authority might stand, as political psychologists John Sabini and Maury Silver note, ethical blame cannot be transferred to others. Referring to Milgram’s subjects they ask, “Yet how could the experimenter take upon himself their responsibility? Responsibility is not property that can be borrowed, shared, loaned, or repossessed” (197). Citing someone else as the cause of one’s actions cannot alter the reality that those very actions were taken by one’s own hands, whether it is directly axing hundreds of Tutsi to death or experimentally delivering a fatal shock to a fellow volunteer. The reasoning is illogical, however, “the essence of obedience consists of the fact that a person comes to view himself as the instrument for carrying out another person’s wishes, and he therefore no longer regards himself as responsible for his actions” (Milgram xiii). In fact, Milgram’s findings show that in these situations, the participant no longer thinks of the larger, deadly implications of his actions, but instead his “moral concern now shifts to a consideration of how well he is living up to the expectations that the authority has of him” to carry out the task at hand (8, emphasis added).\n\nFinally, the ways in which Milgram’s experiment was designed to break down individuals’ resistance to the task asked of them can be seen at work in the Rwandan genocide as well. The gradual escalation in the severity of the task being asked of both Milgram’s volunteers and Habyarimana’s Hutus is what allowed them to eventually reach their shocking potentials. By only increasing the voltage delivered by 15 after each incorrect answer, Milgram’s teachers found difficulty in deciding when it was appropriate to stop. With each shock was only slightly higher than the last, and repetition making the task easier, little justification existed for stopping at any given point rather than just before or just afterwards. In the same fashion, many who began killing with certain reservations eventually lost them. “Some became more hardened with experience and learned how to slaughter even those whom they had once refused to harm” (“Leave”). Tutsi neighbors and friends later became as worthy of death as the Rwandan Patriotic Front fighter. The extent of atrocities reached the point where one UNAMIR officer said, “I had seen war before, but I had never seen a woman carrying a baby on her back kill another woman with a baby on her back” (as qtd in “Leave”). With each successive task executed, both Milgram’s subjects and the Rwandan killers became increasingly desensitized to their actions as their superiors continued demanding more of them.\n\nFurther eroding the Pastor’s resistance was the complicity of so many around him that he, too, thought nothing of cooperating with the militia. Milgram’s explanation of group conformity to defy the experimenter in one variation of his experiment can be applied to the Pastor’s situation in reverse. In the experiment, participants were influenced by two rebelling confederates into believing that rebellion was normal or proper and thus acted similarly in order not to be seen disapprovingly by their peers (Milgram 120). In the Pastor’s case, not only was almost everyone around him obeying the Hutu Power government, but a third, related principle of division of responsibility further assuaged any fears he might have had about his conduct: because so many other people were involved in the genocide throughout the country, any moral authority that might have held sway over the Pastor diminished in power. When evenly dispersed between him and the militia, the question of moral responsibility became insignificant. Amongst the general Rwandan public, even, Human Rights Watch found that “[s]ome who refused at the start became convinced to act when all authorities seemed to speak with one voice, when the leaders of their parties joined with administrators to demand their participation and when the military stood behind, ready to intimidate those who hesitated” (“Leave”).\n\nOne final variable which likely broke any resolve Pastor Ntakirutimana might have had to not abandon his congregation was the perpetual dehumanization of Tutsis in daily Hutu Power rhetoric. From the beginning of the conflict, extremists circulated the Hutu Ten Commandments that depicted all Tutsis and their sympathizers as evil. Ultimately, “[i]t was designed to marginalize the Tutsis and create an atmosphere in which their mass destruction would be acceptable, almost inevitable” (Fergal 10). Although Milgram did not explicitly study the effect of dehumanization in his experiments, he did vary the proximity of the learner to the subject and found that when the victim was segregated and out of view and earshot, subjects completed the shocks at a higher rate, a rough approximation to the psychological distance created between an aggressor and his dehumanized victim (Milgram 22-23). Because Pastor Ntakirutimana did not have to actively participate in the murder himself, instead resting safely out of town with his family, the psychological burden of his actions likely was lighter and easier to bear. Thus, the less like him the refugees became, the easier it was for him to allow for their murder to pass.\n\nBut if dehumanization, group conformity, and escalation of tasks work to break down resistance, when we turn to Rusesbagina’s story we must ask what bolsters resistance. Some might say proximity, as was the case in Milgram’s experiments. Rusesbagina, as temporary manager of the Hotel des Milles Collines, himself lived with the refugees to oversee the protection of his building, making it much more difficult for him to give in to the demands of the Hutu Power authorities. Just as distancing the subjects resulted in a higher rate of obedience in Milgram’s experiments, bringing them closer together decreased the rate. Proximity to victims creates a more awkward and socially unacceptable situation wherein participants are simultaneously exposed to direct judgment by both the nearby victim and the presiding authority, making an “acceptable” action difficult. In his own analysis, Milgram views the decision-making process as an internal struggle of strain and buffers. For disobedient subjects, the strain of the experimenter’s demands, living up to one’s side of a contract, and furthering the cause of science vie against a sense of morality for the subject’s obedience. Buffer actions, such as teachers hinting the correct answer, are attempts to ease the internal discomfort, but ultimately subjects are driven to end the experiment. The particulars of Rusesbagina’s situation, however, complicate any direct comparisons. Yes, Rusesbagina possessed strong morals and empathy for those who were suffering in his hotel, just as Milgram’s subjects often recalled feeling sorry for the victim if they were ever in the same position (Milgram 51). He also resorted to the ordinarily immoral act of bribery to creatively cope with his situation and buy off bloodthirsty soldiers with alcohol. However, as a well-educated Hutu man in a high-paying occupation, he had little to gain from replacing his Tutsti neighbors and likely was not as susceptible to the Tutsi-dehumanizing radio propaganda. Additionally, he was faced with a third, competing authority (the first being his conscience and the second the militia) of his manager and the international company that owned the hotel. As an employee and caretaker, he was responsible for maintaining the image of Hotel des Milles Collines, a concern whose importance cannot be underestimated in retrospect. Despite these deficiencies in Milgram’s experiment to perfectly explain Rusesbagina’s situation, it is clear that in this case a strong moral consciousness was able to outweigh immoral authority and provide the possibility of hope for individuals facing similar choices in the future.\n\nBy beginning to understand the actions of Pastor Ntakirutimana and Paul Rusesbagina as individuals first, psychology helps shed light on how great atrocities like the Rwandan genocide can occur. It is neither the result of immutable dogma nor mechanistic orders but rather the accumulation of thousands of individual actions. Psychology, however, cannot model everything and still remains imperfectly restricted to the confines of the laboratory. While focusing primarily on the stories of Ntakirutimana and Rusesbagina, I must also acknowledge a third category that I have only mentioned tangentially and which does as neatly parallel the Milgram experiment: that of the ordinary Hutu peasant-turned-militia member. Facing bleak prospects for the future when the genocide began, these individuals were even more susceptible to the incitement tactics that allowed for Pastor Ntakirutimana’s complicity. However, the breakdown of resistance that includes a transfer of responsibility, dehumanization of the victim, and gradual escalation in severity of tasks is offset in each militia member by the same factors of proximity that led Rusesbagina to disobey. The act of personally confronting each Tutsi to be killed and repeatedly hacking him to death with a machete counteracts the tendency towards obedience to an incalculable degree.\n\nLooking back, one can only speculate as to the relative strength of each factor in people’s decisions of whether or not to kill. Despite the questions that remain unanswered by science, I believe that overall, viewing the Rwandan genocide in light of Milgram’s experiment reminds us that at the heart of great atrocities lies the actions and pressures of ordinary individuals. As the authors of a retrospective on disobedience in the Milgram experiment state, “if we believe that ordinary people […] can act counter to such streams of destruction, then every one of us may be able to mitigate the harmful consequences of some future malevolent regime” (Modigliani 108). And although the majority of people who find themselves at a crossroads between morality and obedience give in to the latter, the actions of a few courageous people with firm convictions who have refused to compromise themselves assures us of the possibility of a better future.', 'Authority and Genocide in 1994 Rwanda', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '292-autosave', '', '', '2012-03-22 19:56:57', '2012-03-22 19:56:57', '', 292, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?p=297', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

Then a voice rose above the muffled sounds of the crowd, followed by another, and then another: Martin Luther King, Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech, interlaced with words by Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali. The three men’s tones resonated with the rhythm of the African djembe beating in the backdrop. Soon, Christian McBride’s anticipated bass riff joined the refrain. The great speeches faded along with the drum line, and the jazz took hold, as was permissible since the foundation had been laid: Jazz is a music, a history, a culture. That is, African-American culture is intrinsic to jazz.\n\nThe music has its roots in post-Reconstruction New Orleans, at a time when Jim Crow laws lumped Creoles and blacks into one marginalized subgroup. Jazz evolved as a synthesis of “African-derived rhythmic, tonal, and improvisational senses” and French-inspired Creole string ensembles (Hall 36). The word “jazz,” in fact, derives from the Creole jass, a slang term for sex. Granted, Creoles are light-skinned and hardly black in the usual sense of the word. To that Perry Hall, director of African American studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, adds, “Creole participation in jazz came directly as a result of the discovery by Creole musicians of their Blackness” (47). In other words, Creoles began to play jazz after relocation to and degradation in the United States made them party to the black experience. Yet when jazz gained mainstream popularity in 1917, its face was neither black nor Creole. The first jazz record released to the masses was that of the self-proclaimed “Original Dixieland Jazz Band,” a group of five white musicians (Hall 38). In the years that followed, a white musician by the name of Paul Whiteman enjoyed great success performing “symphonic jazz,” a style that tamed the “primitive rhythms” of original jazz and therein became “more acceptable to white audiences” (Hall 38). In uprooting jazz from its African-American culture, Whiteman grossed one million dollars in a single year in the 1920s and was dubbed the “King of Jazz” (Hall 39).\n<h2><strong>Hail to the Thief </strong></h2>\nPaul Whiteman’s success arguably lacked merit, but it was hardly unique. Since Whiteman, white men have perpetually sat atop the thrones of black music. For example, in the 1930s, Benny Goodman, a white man, became the “King of Swing” (Hall 31). Decades later, Elvis Presley was crowned the “King of Rock ‘N’ Roll.” In 2003, Rolling Stone declared Justin Timberlake the “King of R&amp;B” (Kitwana 156). And of course there’s Eminem, who continues to be revered as “the Elvis of hip-hop” (Kitwana 139). How can a white man be the face of black music?\n\nTo answer this question, we must examine the long-standing tradition of mainstream absorption of black musical forms (Hall 32). Beginning with jazz and leading up to hip-hop, white America has appropriated black music as its own. When whites cannot stake claims to black music—as in the case of hip-hop—the nature of the relationship between mainstream society and African-American culture is simply exploitative. This essay will examine the ethics of cross-cultural musical appropriation in an attempt to discover why the Elvises and Eminems are able to reap the glory of African-American cultural innovation.\n<h2><strong>Gillespie, Gifts-Giving, and Genocide</strong></h2>\n“You can’t steal a gift. Bird gave the world his music, and if you can hear it you can have it,” Dizzy Gillespie declared in defense of Phil Woods, a white saxophonist who had been accused of poaching Charlie “the Bird” Parker’s style (Lethem 70). Jonathan Lethem, in his essay “The Ecstasy of Influence: A Plagiarism,” draws inspiration from Gillespie in criticizing copyrights and exploring the concept of a “gift economy” (65). According to Lethem, works of art exist in such an economy, which is rooted in the poignancy of the product (65-66). This gift economy is independent of the market economy in which art and music are commoditized because “a gift conveys an uncommodifiable surplus of inspiration” (Lethem 66). No doubt black musical forms—as is true of all art—function in such an economy both in giving and receiving. To a greater extent, rock ‘n’ roll connoisseur Theodore Gracyk questions whether there was ever an African-American musical form “that wasn’t already the result of miscegenation and hybridization” (86). For example, as noted earlier, the first jazz musicians drew inspiration from both “the French tradition of military marching bands” and the European-style string orchestra (Hall 36). As Lethem would argue for any art, the making of music is a continual process of borrowing and sharing. Thus, Gillespie and Gracyk are right to say that black artists cannot claim exclusivity to black music. But what, then, distinguishes the use of black music by white musicians from the continual borrowing and sharing of musical property upon which black music is built?\n\nIn truth, the gift analogy is oversimplified. You certainly cannot “steal” a gift if it has been given to you, but you can misuse it. When appropriating black musical forms, white artists such as Paul Whiteman often reshape and redefine the styles to “minimize their association with ‘Blackness’” (Hall 32).  This type of cultural appropriation is less an exchange of gifts than “a virtual stripping of Black musical genius and aesthetic innovation” (Hall 33). To Gracyk, the very process of reshaping is what grants “those engaged in appropriation … some right to claim ownership of the music they perform” (107). Thus, symphonic jazz can be appreciated independently of the black musical style from which it is derived, and its creation gives whites some cultural ownership of jazz. Yet Gracyk fails to recognize the effect of appropriation on the original musical form, which distinguishes unethical appropriation from the harmless inspiration that Lethem supports. In the most basic sense, a gift can be considered “misused” when it is damaged through usage. As is often the case when mainstream America whitewashes black cultural property and then claims it as its own, the result is what philosopher Amiri Baraka, one of the greatest voices of “spoken word” jazz, describes as a “cultural genocide” (quoted in Gracyk 110).\n\nGracyk rejects this notion of cultural genocide. According to Gracyk, “the analogy with genocide hinges on the thesis that, were it not for the nonreciprocal behavior of the cultural imperialist, the ‘dominated’ culture would not have changed” (110). Because African-American culture would have evolved independently of white influence, white America’s reshaping of black musical forms, he claims, simply gives rise to a “legitimate transformation” (110). Gracyk depicts this instance of cultural appropriation as natural, yet black musical forms have tended to evolve unwillingly. New forms emerge in hopes of reestablishing “the distinctiveness of Black music in a given sociohistorical context” (Hall 32). What is particularly unnatural is the continual need for African Americans to reassert their cultural autonomy. For example, when rock music became more closely associated with Elvis than Chuck Berry, black musicians such as Ray Charles and Sam Cooke fused rhythm and blues with “gospel-inflected harmonies” to create what became known in the 1960s as “soul” (Hall 44). Such innovation is less the result of dynamism than of marginalization. Cultural genocide arises when the art is separated from the people (Hall 31). The heavily-consumed, appropriated forms are “ineffective as expressions and affirmations of the unique cultural experiences from which they arise” (Hall 32). Cultural meanings are thereby often erased (Hall 35), as happened when whites appropriated soul music—which spoke to black emotion and struggle during the Civil Rights Movement—and called it “disco” (Hall 45). When whites appropriate black music, the art is stripped not only of its cultural identity but also of its ability to function in the gift economy. Although Lethem agrees that one cannot steal a gift, he argues that one can destroy it: “Where there is no gift there is no art, [thus] it may be possible to destroy a work of art by converting it into a pure commodity” (66). When black musical forms are completely dissociated from their emotional foundation—as in the case of soul’s devolution into disco—the result is no longer a work of art but a mere commodity, which Lethem defines by its inability to create a genuine emotional connection (66). However, the mainstream need not appropriate black music in order to commoditize it. We see this in the case of hip-hop. Though rap has been reinterpreted by a myriad of races, including whites, it is nevertheless identified with African-American culture—a culture that is now bought and sold.\n<h2><strong>Back Yard DJs to NWA: Origins of Hip Hop</strong></h2>\n<blockquote>Rap in general dates all the way back to the motherland, where tribes would use call-and-response chants. In the 1930s and 1940s you had Cab Calloway pioneering his style of jazz rhyming. The sixties you had the love style of rapping, with Isaac Hayes, Barry White, and the poetry style of rapping with the Last Poets, the Watts poets and the militant style of rapping with brothers like Malcolm X and Minister Louis Farrakhan.\n–Afrika Bambaata, 1993\n(quoted in Perkins 2)</blockquote>\nRap is revolutionary as a black musical form because every path traces its lineage back to an element of African-American culture. Granted, today there are countless cultural varieties of hip-hop from Asian to Hispanic rap; still, all of these styles are indisputably derived from black music. So far, hip-hop has inspired imitations but it has nevertheless resisted cultural genocide. That is not to say, however, that it has escaped exploitation.\n\nHip-hop was born in the South Bronx in the mid 1970s as the product of the yard culture of West Kingston brought to New York by Jamaican immigrants in the late ’60s: “Yard DJs brought huge speakers and turntables to the slums, where they rapped over the simple bass lines of the ska and reggae beats … The DJ ruled during hip hop’s early days, and it was the DJ who established the foundations for the lyricist (MC)” (Perkins 6). In the 1980s, black middle-class rappers L.L. Cool J and the group Run DMC, both from suburban Queens, were representative of the first wave of hip hop artists to achieve mainstream success (Perkins 15)—that is, until\ntheir minimalist style gave way to controversial “gangsta” rap in the 1990s (Perkins 18). “The gangsta was epitomized by the now defunct group NWA (Niggas with Attitude), which consisted of the MCs Dr. Dre, Ezy-E, Ice Cube, MC Ren ... and Ice-T” (Perkins 18). Then came the “message rap” of artists such as Long Island’s Public Enemy, which was followed by the much less political “booty rap” of groups like 2 Live Crew (Perkins 19-20). Rap’s decades-long transformation exemplifies the natural cultural dynamics about which Gracyk theorizes. Its cultural autonomy remained intact at this point. Then, in the late 1990s, a white rapper from Detroit emerged on the scene and started down the path to becoming hip-hop’s Elvis.\n<h2> <strong>The Blue-Eyed Baller</strong></h2>\n<blockquote>“If I have a cup of coffee that is too strong for me because it is too black, I weaken it by pouring cream into it.”(2)\n–Malcolm X, 1963</blockquote>\nIn 2003, a well-established hip-hop magazine, The Source, acted on a personal vendetta against the industry’s most successful artist of the time, white rapper Eminem. In an attempt to derail the rapper’s career, The Source published lyrics from unreleased tracks by Eminem that featured blatantly racist attacks on black women: “Girls I like have big butts / no they don’t, ’cause I don’t like that nigga shit … Black and whites they sometimes mix / But black girls only want your money / cause they be dumb chicks” (quoted in Kitwana 136). After a public apology in which Eminem attributed his racist remarks to teenage angst and bitter resentment toward an African-American ex-girlfriend, Eminem’s success and popularity were unaffected (Kitwana 141). But The Source’s crusade against the white rapper did not end there; the magazine’s greatest concern was not that rap’s most successful artist was racist, but that he was white and that hip-hop rightly belonged to a black youth subculture (Kitwana 136). Granted, Eminem was not the first white rapper to enjoy mainstream success. In fact, the first No. 1 hip-hop album was the all white hip-hop group The Beastie Boys’ 1986 License to Ill (White 201). Similarly, the first hip-hop single to top the charts was Vanilla Ice’s “Ice, Ice Baby” in 1991 (Perkins 37). But the most successful white rappers often parodied the genre, which led some listeners to write them off as “wiggers.” Eminem’s music was revered as genuine hip-hop, and The Source feared the familiarity of his success. Countless times, owners of The Source declared that Eminem was on “the fast track to becoming hip-hop’s Elvis” (Kitwana 136). That is, as had happened with Elvis, yet another black musical form would be more closely identified with an iconic white artist than with black artists.\n\nIn the early 1950s, Sam Phillips—the Sun Records executive who helped Elvis rise to stardom—proclaimed, “If I could find a white man who had the Negro sound and the Negro feel, I could make a billion dollars” (quoted in Perkins 38). Unlike his wannabe predecessors, Eminem can produce rap with that very “Negro feel.” His lyrics have thematic similarities to some black rap because Eminem grew up in the marginalized class of impoverished white Americans. Hence, his music preserves the emotional aspect of the hip-hop gift. Perhaps Eminem’s music exemplifies hip-hop’s ability to function as a gift economy. After all, whereas Elvis’ stardom catalyzed rock ‘n’ roll to become the predominately white musical form it is today, Eminem’s success has not given hip-hop a white face. Has the music industry evolved beyond racial exploitation, or is the mainstream interested in keeping hip-hop black?\n<h2><strong>Mr. Ambassador at the Minstrel Show</strong></h2>\nIn late 2002, the New York Times Magazine ran a cover story on hip-hop’s cultural bandit, Marshall Mathers, a.k.a. Eminem, and titled it “Mr. Ambassador” (Kitwana 160). The astute title was fitting for the rap superstar who had previously been labeled the “king” of hip-hop, for Eminem is just that: the envoy of white America to the hip-hop nation. Eminem has attracted many mainstream listeners to hip-hop essentially because he looks like they do. Before Eminem, true hip-hop—which excludes the whitewashed works of Vanilla Ice and the Beastie Boys—was exclusively black and therefore incomprehensible to most white audiences. It does not follow, however, that Enimem is the white man’s rapper. Quite the contrary: “although rap is still proportionately more popular among blacks, its primary audience is white and lives in the suburbs” (Samuels, quoted in Kitwana 82). In February 2004, Forbes reported that of an estimated 45 million hip-hop consumers between the ages of 13 and 34, eighty percent are white (Kitwana 82). This begs the question: Why do white people love hip-hop, that is, hip-hop in its true form? According to pop journalist Arnold White, “Rap flourished into corporate-sponsored hip hop because of the symbiosis that held whites enthralled to Blacks and kept Blacks indentured” (183). White America’s embrace of hip-hop culture is hardly a move toward racial acceptance and cultural understanding. Rather, it is the product of “white supremacy (i.e. black kids selling black images of black criminality and inferiority and white kids buying them to reinforce their superiority)” (Kitwana 103). Hip-hop perpetuates the American tradition of minstrelsy, except that rather than whites painting their faces black, black artists have succumbed to stereotypes of themselves. In the case of hip-hop, white supremacy is enforced not through imitation but consumption of the “minstrel portrait” of black “dehumanization” (Baraka 328). In the eyes of the mainstream, hip-hop reinforces conventions and stereotypes of blackness that foster white power.\n\nThough Eminem may honor hip-hop as a gift, the mainstream renders it a commodity. A commodity fails to establish an emotional connection between two people (Lethem 66). Though rap music showcases black suffering, mainstream America receives it not with compassion but with mockery—white supremacy prevents an emotional connection. Previous musical generations saw white artists destroying the gift of black music by failing to recreate its poignancy; the hip-hop generation sees poignancy destroyed through direct commoditization. In the case of hip-hop, whites are able to reap the power and profits of black culture not by marginalizing black ingenuity but by exploiting it. Simply put: whites couldn’t do it better themselves.\n<h2><strong>Why Deny the Obvious, Child?</strong></h2>\nHip-hop may have broken the appropriative trend between mainstream America and black music, but it has done little to end the marginalization of African Americas. It seems that the key issue is not so much the act of appropriation as the driving force behind it. Incidentally, when discussing mainstream absorption of black music, few scholars aside from Theodore Gracyk acknowledge its contributions. We cannot deny that “rock would not exist without  propriation” (Gracyk 97), nor can we blame individual artists for acts of appropriation.\n\nTake, for example, Paul Simon’s Graceland, which is often criticized for Simon’s arguably exploitative use of a group of South African folk singers to enhance the tone of the album and, ultimately, his own success. The accusation runs: “Visually and aurally, Simon appears as the white master who exerts a benign rule over his black subjects” (Mitchell, quoted in Gracyk 91). Yet to suggest that Simon’s work with the South African choir had imperialistic motives is excessive. In truth, he was motivated by “a genuine love of South African music” (Gracyk 98); we cannot criticize him for that. Concomitantly, the South African tribal leader Joseph Shabalala praised Simon for “the opportunity to disclose [their] music all over the world” (quoted in Gracyk 105). Though not Simon’s fault, Graceland failed to inspire interest in South African music. Most people I know who own the album admit to skipping the only track that features the South African choir almost exclusively. The only music Graceland successfully promoted was that of Paul Simon—just as when Keith Richards and Mick Jagger started the Rolling Stones, in Richards’ words, “to turn other people on to” African-American blues artist Muddy Waters (quoted in Gracyk 15), they really only turned people on to the Rolling Stones.\n\nThe crime, then, is not the use of black musical gifts but the bigotry that often leads to their commoditization. The success of Graceland and the Rolling Stones speaks to whites’ lack of interest in the black experience and their desire not simply to steal black music, but more basically to de-contextualize it—that is, to avoid establishing emotional connections. Appreciation of black music goes hand in hand with appreciation of black people, except in the case of hip-hop through which blacks have allowed themselves to be dehumanized. That is not to say that non-hip-hop black musicians enjoy no mainstream success—we know that to be untrue. Rather, mainstream America tends to depreciate black music, for connecting emotionally with such works of art might bring about an understanding of black suffering that would undermine white supremacy. Moreover, the commoditization of black music continues to foster white power by granting financial success to those who control the music industry: whites. The power disparity between whites and blacks in the music industry suggests that music is another tool the mainstream uses to perpetuate black marginalization. As Amiri Baraka has observed, “The laws once openly stated blacks inferior. Now it is the relationship these laws uphold that maintain the de facto oppression” (329). In the shift from de jure to de facto racism, mainstream America reshaped bigotry in much the same way it did black music—through the simple process of whitewashing.\n<h2>Note</h2>\n1.

(298, 5, '2011-12-19 08:04:58', '2011-12-19 08:04:58', 'For millennia words were humanity’s most accurate way of recording and remembering history. But in the last 150 years, the world has come to take for granted what Roland Barthes called the “evidential force” of the photographic image, its ability to show us a slice of reality, something that once was. Documentary photographers and photojournalists have provided us with what we consider the most persuasive form of historical evidence, and we rely on such reporters and their documents to bring us information about important events and situations around the world. But like words, images can relate fact or fiction. And as with words, our understanding of the veracity of images is largely determined by the genre in which they are used. In recent years changing journalistic ideals and technologies have contributed to the emergence of an increasingly subjective, cinematic style of journalism, and as a result the status of the image as a reliable historical document is being compromised. As it becomes ever more difficult to distinguish fact from fiction we run the serious risk of assuming the role of a mere audience in a world that desperately needs our active participation.\r\n\r\nUntil the 1920s cameras were large and awkward devices, but the release of the Leica, a lightweight, portable camera, in 1925 enabled the modern field of photojournalism to emerge. The desire to represent important moments with pictures is an ancient impulse seen in drawings, paintings, and engravings, but with “fast” cameras like the Leica came the possibility of actually capturing moments in a mechanical, scientific, and seemingly objective manner. Photographers began to exploit the speed of the camera to capture, for the first time in history, “candid” images, images that were not posed (Davenport 96). Along with the new cameras came a new philosophy that photographs should, and could, capture the immediate truth of an objective reality.\r\nThe “documentary” genre that emerged from this philosophy shot from a head-on, eye-level angle, in sharp focus, without elaborate composition, and with natural light. The documentary style seemed to eliminate most of the subjective interference and artistic pretension of the photographer. This documentary style became the default for photojournalism and is still the style we associate with news. Photojournalists, documentary photographers who intend their work for publication, quickly became important fixtures in news organizations as the public clamored for new and interesting images of the world. The years leading up to World War II saw the rise of professional photojournalism, and with the introduction of Life magazine in 1936, documentary photographs became equal to words as America’s source of information (Davenport 98).\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_111" align="alignright" width="250" caption="Figure1"]<img class="size-full wp-image-111 " title="Figure1" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Figure1.jpg" alt="Figure1" width="250" height="261" />[/caption]\r\n\r\nAt the end of World War II it would be through the medium of photography that Americans would come to fully understand the evil they had been battling. Images from Nazi concentration camps were irrefutable proof that the war had been necessary and just. Margaret Bourke-White’s photograph (Fig. 1) of a woman covering her face to avoid looking at a heap of dead bodies is one of the most disturbing and compelling images from the camps. It is also an example of the important attributes of good photojournalism. Unlike most of Bourke-White’s photographs, which tend to be stylized and dramatically lit (Fig. 2 &amp; 3), this image is shot in the straightforward documentary style. The photographer does not aestheticize the scene. There is a simple reporting of facts: the dead bodies, the MP’s, the civilians. The only missing information is supplied by the caption, “German civilians made to face their nation’s crime, Bauchenwald, 1945” (Callahan 128). This objectivity allows the viewer to make a variety of interpretations: the woman is horrified by what has happened, she is unwilling to accept what she sees, her refusal to look represents the willful blindness of the German people to the Nazi’s activities. As in real life, the exact meaning of the scene, and the appropriate reaction to it, are left for the viewer to determine. Bourke-White’s image acts on the viewer much the way the real scene might. First there is the recognition of something altogether wrong, something hideously unnatural. Then disbelief sets in (Are they dead? Is it real?), followed by shock, disgust, rage, and finally sorrow, a sorrow filled with the grim acceptance of the truth of the image and the world it captures.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_110" align="alignright" width="250" caption="Figure2"]<img class="size-full wp-image-110 " title="Figure2" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Figure2.jpg" alt="Figure2" width="250" height="170" />[/caption]\r\n\r\nBourke-White’s image documents a specific event in which Germans were forced to view Bauchenwald, and at the same time stands as a representative image of the larger history of the Holocaust and WWII. The photographic style makes it a strong historical document on both accounts. Documentary style images appear “realistic,” that is as objective reportings of actual situations, to which the photograph bears witness. This realism allows the viewer to see past the medium of the photograph itself, into the content of the scene depicted. In the mind of the viewer the image becomes equal to the event, and the photograph then plays on the emotions as if it were real. The photograph can act, says Susan Sontag, “[as] a means of making ‘real’ (or more ‘real’) matters that the privileged and the merely safe might prefer to ignore” (7). The power of the documentary image lies in its ability to elicit from the viewer an “active response,” rather than passive acceptance or mere voyeurism (Sontag 81). The photograph, any photograph, is a window onto a world. The photographic style is a key component in determining whether we perceive that world as our own—real, factual, historical—world, or some other—unreal, fictional, imaginary—world. Only when the image is perceived as factual can it carry the full weight of an historical document, and ensure that we will remember the reality of the event depicted.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_109" align="alignright" width="212" caption="Figure3"]<img class="size-full wp-image-109 " title="Figure3" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Figure3.jpg" alt="Figure3" width="212" height="250" />[/caption]\r\n\r\nThe fact that there is nothing special, aesthetically speaking, about Bourke-White’s image gives it added credibility as a document. There is no rule that a photojournalist’s work cannot be beautiful. But a beautiful image is typically associated with the efforts of an artist. Since art is sometimes thought of as subjective self-expression, the goals of an artist might seem to interfere with the journalistic ideal of objective factual reporting. What is important here is not whether these goals do necessarily interfere, nor whether the photographer is an artist or a journalist—I believe he can be both. The value of an historical document is derived from the relationship between the document and the viewer. If a photograph that is dramatically composed and lit gives the appearance of having been orchestrated or manipulated by the photographer, or if the composition appears to be implying an opinion or romantic vision, it cannot be equated with an objective factual reality. Since this equating is what gives the photograph its weight as a document, the belief of the viewer is the primary factor in determining the historical authority of an image. While not inherently incompatible with journalism, beauty can easily conflict with and overshadow substance, particularly in a medium that is by its nature biased toward appearances.* An image that is not as “good” is less likely to seem planned or manufactured, and is therefore seemingly more objective, hence more believable as a document.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_108" align="alignright" width="250" caption="Figure4"]<img class="size-full wp-image-108 " title="Figure4" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Figure4.jpg" alt="Figure4" width="250" height="165" />[/caption]\r\n\r\nThe power and truth of an image seem to lie more in the murky waters of human psychology than in the objective properties of the image itself. According to art historian John Tagg the acceptability of an image as an historical document has very little to do with its visual style. In his book The Burden of Representation, Tagg asserts that our belief in the factual nature of the documentary genre is a culturally defined convention (8-10, 103, 119). He argues that the acceptance of certain types of images as forms of historical evidence stems from their adoption and dissemination by respected governmental and private institutions, such as law enforcement agencies and newspaper publishers, who presented these images as accurate representations of reality. It is not, according to Tagg, the authority of the image that makes it a valid historical document, but the authority of the institution that legitimizes the image (4, 63, 76, 118). Over time we have, as a society, been conditioned to accept documentary style images as accurate representations of reality, but the documentary style is just a genre, and we might, Tagg implies, have accepted a different visual style as “realistic.”\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_107" align="alignright" width="250" caption="Figure5"]<img class="size-full wp-image-107 " title="Figure5" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Figure5.jpg" alt="Figure5" width="250" height="164" />[/caption]\r\n\r\nTagg’s is an interesting perspective to take when examining the work of contemporary photographer Sebastião Salgado. Salgado is considered by some the most talented documentary photographer working today. For the last sixteen years he has been taking pictures of suffering: suffering caused by civil war, oppression, and famine. Yet because of the extreme beauty of many of his images, Salgado has been accused of making art out of the suffering of others. He has said, “What I want in my pictures is not that they’ll look like art objects. They are journalist pictures. All my pictures. No exceptions” (Harris 160). During 1984-85 Salgado was in the Sahel region of Africa, where refugees from Ethiopia’s civil war were being killed, not by violence, but by famine. While in some of his photographs Salgado employs a straightforward documentary style to great journalistic effect (Fig. 4 &amp; 5), in others his framing, composition, and aesthetic decisions seem to reject the notion that there is any boundary between subjective art and objective journalism. Salgado does not differentiate between his different types of images, and in displaying his photographs side by side he indicates to the viewer that they are of equal journalistic importance.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_106" align="alignright" width="250" caption="Figure6"]<img class="size-full wp-image-106 " title="Figure6" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Figure6.jpg" alt="Figure6" width="250" height="164" />[/caption]\r\n\r\nOne of Salgado’s most famous images (Fig. 6), the first of 29 prints in his photo essay from the Sahel, of what appears to be a group of nomads crossing the desert, has an epic, cinematic quality to it. As he often does, Salgado frames his subjects on the edge of a barren landscape, isolating them and making them seem alone in a vast, empty world. Wrapped in blankets his nomads are like natural objects, pillars of rock or sand. This serves to create a frozen quality that is common to Salgado’s images. It seems as though his figures have been standing forever, as if time had stopped thousands of years ago while the Jews were still wandering the desert, and this image is of that unchanging, eternal moment. The image has no internal clues as to its context, either in time or in location. The wrapped figure on the right, we cannot tell if it is a man or a woman, clearly resonates with images of the Madonna (Fig. 7). It even appears that there is a child being held underneath her cloak. If we focus on this character, we can see that she has an aura, or glow. The sky to the far left and right of the Madonna figure is a much darker shade of gray than what surrounds her. And this aura extends below the horizon, down around the edges of the subject. The only natural cause for this odd lighting might be if the sun were directly behind the figure. Yet it is clear from the highlights that the sun is to the left of the subjects and low in the sky. The cloth on the left edge of the Madonna figure, however, seems darker than it should be, and is not picking up the same highlight as the other figures. Though there is no way to prove it, this aura appears to be the product of work done in the darkroom.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_105" align="alignright" width="250" caption="Figure7"]<img class="size-full wp-image-105 " title="Figure7" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Figure7.jpg" alt="Figure7" width="250" height="176" />[/caption]\r\n\r\nNYU professor and curator Fred Ritchin has said that “while respecting the facts of the situation, Salgado attempts to re-create, through visual metaphor, what he sees as its essential human drama—the invisible made visible” (147). One wonders if Salgado embeds the Christian symbolism consciously and purposefully, or if it simply arises from the “invisible” world he brings forth. Ritchin goes on to suggest that Salgado, a Brazilian, “[is] with other Latin Americans drawn to what has been called a ‘magical realism’” (147). His photograph of an emaciated boy standing in the desert, leaning on a cane (Fig. 8) is an example of an image whose documentary value is intermingled with its magical qualities. The boy’s physical condition, the dead tree, and the barren landscape seem, as a documentary statement, to be about drought, famine, poverty, hardship. But as in the previous image there is a narrative, cinematic quality. The boy’s cane, and his skeletal features give him the dual appearance of child and old man. The analogy of the boy with the tree, and the fact that the boy is naked, again make the subject feel like part of the natural environment. The frozen feeling and the completely unified white background give this image an otherworldly quality. The subject stands erect, poised, proud, staring out at what we can only assume to be more emptiness. Salgado’s subject becomes the sole human journeying through this vast other universe which is somehow natural, yet eternal and transcendent.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_104" align="alignright" width="166" caption="Figure 8"]<img class="size-full wp-image-104 " title="Figure 8" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Figure8.jpg" alt="Figure 8" width="166" height="250" />[/caption]\r\n\r\nThe above photographs cannot be said to employ the documentary style. Yet Salgado is considered, and considers himself, a documentary photographer and photojournalist. Salgado’s story is more subjective and his images more beautiful than most documentary work. But does that mean that his photographs are less reliable as historical documents? The answer is that Salgado is not, for the most part, concerned with documenting the obvious or apparent circumstances of his subjects. He seeks to tell the story not of the individuals he photographs, nor of their broader situation, but of what he seems to see as a universal human story of suffering and spiritual transcendence. It is Salgado’s story, a parable drawn from Latin American Catholic influences, but certainly not journalism or documentary photography as it is normally understood. Salgado is like a writer who mixes journalism, editorial, and fiction in the same book and leaves it to his readers to understand the difference. That Salgado is considered a documentary photographer raises the question of what it means at this moment in time to document reality.\r\n\r\nI believe that Salgado’s style is indicative of a changing tolerance in what is being accepted as real, and at the same time a changing understanding of what reality is. And these are not changes for the better. New forms of media have altered the conventional social understanding of what represents factual reality. Flipping television channels we go from Fox News (reality?), to "Law and Order" “ripped from the headlines” (fiction?), to "Survivor" (reality television?). On television, as in Salgado’s images, there is no clear way to define where fact ends and fiction begins. Keeping in mind Tagg’s argument that different visual styles might be accepted as real, it is possible, and I think probable, that Salgado’s magical, or spiritual realism is a style that to him best represents reality. His photographs record subjective reality, and are in that sense documentary and historical, but not journalistic.\r\n\r\nIf his images are accepted as real, if they are truly equated with reality, then they may represent a new convention, a new type of historical document. Yet the magical realism, epic landscapes, perfect lighting and framing (and perhaps special effects) of Salgado’s photographs have a cinematic quality. And like films they seem real in a way that reality is not—better, more interesting, and importantly, more bearable. There is no violence, no horror, no struggle that is too much for a movie viewer to bear. If journalism looks like film it allows us to suspend our disbelief, when we should in fact be (as with the Bourke-White image) confronting our disbelief. For images “to alter conduct,” Susan Sontag argues, “they must shock” (81). But images such as Salgado’s trigger our movie viewing persona, one that expects and accepts violence, destruction, and suffering. In the majority of Salgado’s images, the form overwhelms the content, and the vital step of equating the image with reality does not take place.\r\n\r\nAs we continue to gain more of our factual information from television, the television style image will replace the documentary image as the default indicator of reality. Wide screen, High Definition televisions, which will soon be ubiquitous, will give television a more cinematic appearance, and as “films” begin to be shot on High Definition video (rather than film) the difference in aesthetic quality between television and film will largely dissolve. Salgado’s style of documentary is a precursor to what will become an epic, cinematic style of journalism, which will not clearly separate fact from fiction.\r\n\r\nJournalistic objectivity may be an arbitrary convention, a form of subjectivity unconsciously agreed upon as representing truth. Yet even if that is the case the maintenance of a conventional means of depicting true events is absolutely necessary for a morally functional society. Words and images are our only means of conveying complex information. While we have rules of logic for language, there are no such rules for images. Without a conventional standard for veracity, communication becomes the meaningless shuffling of symbols. For decades the documentary style image has been the standard for truth, but as artists like Salgado appropriate and incorporate this style into a subjective documentary genre, our journalism and our world will become more beautiful and less real, and photography will lose its power to represent reality, and to elicit an active response. If photographic documents do not act on us as if they were real, if images like Bourke-White’s are seen as fiction rather than fact, than we will lose the power and knowledge of our history. And will be doomed to repeat it.\r\n\r\n* I am not arguing that art must always be beautiful, only that a visual image that is beautiful conforms to what is typcially understood as an artist''s goal. A beautiful painting does not happen by chance, the way a beautiful photograph can, and many paintings we see are beautiful. Therefore, whether or not it is true in the case of a photograph, we may be tempted to equate beauty with design, which affects the viewer''s beliefs about an given image.\r\n<h2>Images</h2>\r\nCallahan, Sean.

Messages need to be archived.]</strong>\r\n\r\nDear Readers,\r\n\r\nThe essayist Randolph Bourne--a leftist intellectual and graduate of Columbia University''s class of 1905(?) rejected the possibility of young people writing meaningful essays. “The youthful essayist,” he wrote in the month before his death in 1918, “is afraid you will think he is unsophisticated, while the middle-aged doesn’t much care if you do. […] The youthful essayist usually develops into the professional anecdotalist, with an active mind that is harnessed up to no real thinking but can only stream off from itself a futile current of incident” (506). This is a strange—even a disheartening—sentiment to hear from Bourne, an essayist who never made it to sanguine middle age himself. He was writing, however, about the "light essay," a form of the essay that was epitomized by such well known writers as Charles Lamb. But Bourne, while insightful about many things, including the dangers of American thinkers tacitly approving the first World War, because they did not sufficiently consider what it asked us to rethink about democracy itself, was wrong about the essay. And Bourne also here fails to mention his own first attempts to do "real thinking" in essays in the Columbia Monthly, including articles on X, Y, and Z. If Bourne were a first year student at Columbia today, I would guess that he would be a prolific blogger, and would seek out as many opportunities for explorations of his ideas in public as he could.\r\n\r\nTo write an essay to an imagined (and actual) audience of smart readers who are not familiar with the particulars of the issues that concern oneself, but who can become interested by them is no small feat. To write both persuasively, thoughtfully, responsibly about questions about contemporary topics ranging from use of placebos trials to the complexity of drag performance, or the lasting effects of DADT despite its revocation situates the student writer as a person who can and should speak/write publicly on these issues--not to simply express his or her opinions, but to begin the heady process of entering into an existing intellectual conversation and exchange of ideas.\r\n\r\nThere is a genre called the essay which is particularly flexible and able to accomodate a wide range of subjects, writerly stances, aesthetic experiments and argumentative strategies. It is the essay''s diversity that this publication showcases and celebrates, although we do emphasize essays that make their arguments rather more explicitly than those on the more implicit and elliptical end of the spectrum.\r\n\r\nI am proud and fascinated of the work that students who are new to this form of writing have been able to accomplish with one semester''s worth of hard study of the genre''s requirements. And of all of what essay asks, it most demands that its writers show up and make their thinking visible to others on the page. This is no solipsistic act--the ideas are there because they are meaningful and could be meaningful to others.\r\n\r\nThe Core curriculum at Columbia includes many famous essayists on its curriculum, including both Michel de Montaigne and Francis Bacon. How fitting then that as students begin their study here that they might find a space to conduct their own experiments in thinking in the only course at Columbia that is required of all first year students: University Writing.\r\n\r\nAs you consider the essays in this journal, you might find it interesting to see how even the most timely of or students'' arguments--that respond to key controversies of their day--the Jessica Lynch story, the Borat movie, the RiceTek patenting case feature ideas that are of lasting interest and merit. This is why essays in the world continue to be read long after their timeliness--their kairotic appeals--diminish: because in the presence of a thinker working carefully to craft an idea about a text well known or just discovered, we feel the thrill of a moment of invention. In essays these moments are not preserved or fixed but recreated, and the force of the best essays by writers regardless of their age is that of the click--the idea that was nascent and only dimmly detected made visible and sharable with others. The art of the essay is alive and well at Columbia and we look forward to many more volumes of The Morningside Review to show us of what new essaysists in our midsts can contribute to the form.\r\n\r\nWith all best wishes,\r\n\r\n<a href="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/NBWsig.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-440" title="NBW signature" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/NBWsig-300x55.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="55" /></a>\r\nNicole B.

But Bourne, while insightful about many things, including the dangers of American thinkers tacitly approving the first World War, because they did not sufficiently consider what it asked us to rethink about democracy itself, was wrong about the essay. And Bourne also here fails to mention his own first attempts to do "real thinking" in essays in the Columbia Monthly, including articles on X, Y, and Z. If Bourne were a first year student at Columbia today, I would guess that he would be a prolific blogger, and would seek out as many opportunities for explorations of his ideas in public as he could.\n\nTo write an essay to an imagined (and actual) audience of smart readers who are not familiar with the particulars of the issues that concern oneself, but who can become interested by them is no small feat. To write both persuasively, thoughtfully, responsibly about questions about contemporary topics ranging from use of placebos trials to the complexity of drag performance, or the lasting effects of DADT despite its revocation situates the student writer as a person who can and should speak/write publicly on these issues--not to simply express his or her opinions, but to begin the heady process of entering into an existing intellectual conversation and exchange of ideas.\n\nThere is a genre called the essay which is particularly flexible and able to accomodate a wide range of subjects, writerly stances, aesthetic experiments and argumentative strategies. It is the essay''s diversity that this publication showcases and celebrates, although we do emphasize essays that make their arguments rather more explicitly than those on the more implicit and elliptical end of the spectrum.\n\nI am proud and fascinated of the work that students who are new to this form of writing have been able to accomplish with one semester''s worth of hard study of the genre''s requirements. And of all of what essay asks, it most demands that its writers show up and make their thinking visible to others on the page. This is no solipsistic act--the ideas are there because they are meaningful and could be meaningful to others.\n\nThe Core curriculum at Columbia includes many famous essayists on its curriculum, including both Michel de Montaigne and Francis Bacon. How fitting then that as students begin their study here that they might find a space to conduct their own experiments in thinking in the only course at Columbia that is required of all first year students: University Writing.\n\nAs you consider the essays in this journal, you might find it interesting to see how even the most timely of or students'' arguments--that respond to key controversies of their day--the Jessica Lynch story, the Borat movie, the RiceTek patenting case feature ideas that are of lasting interest and merit. This is why essays in the world continue to be read long after their timeliness--their kairotic appeals--diminish: because in the presence of a thinker working carefully to craft an idea about a text well known or just discovered, we feel the thrill of a moment of invention. In essays these moments are not preserved or fixed but recreated, and the force of the best essays by writers regardless of their age is that of the click--the idea that was nascent and only dimmly detected made visible and sharable with others. The art of the essay is alive and well at Columbia and we look forward to many more volumes of The Morningside Review to show us of what new essaysists in our midsts can contribute to the form.\n\nWith all best wishes,\n\n<a href="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/NBWsig.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-440" title="NBW signature" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/NBWsig-300x55.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="55" /></a>\nNicole B.

University Writing is one of the classes in Columbia’s Core Curriculum—the set of common courses that each undergraduate takes. As a Core class, University Writing endeavors to help shape and sustain an intellectual community that is committed to expressing itself with grace and clarity. We believe that writing is at the heart of the university’s mission: writing is not merely the manifestation of thought, but involves the discovery and transformation of ideas. It is through writing that students move from being passive learners to active thinkers.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThere are over 70 sections of University Writing taught each semester. The instructors design their own syllabi, drawing their readings from contemporary essays. We read essays in UW both as objects of analysis and as objects of emulation: students learn to write about essays while employing the very writing strategies that these essays use. Each class adheres to the principle that academic writing should respond to a specific <em>problem </em>by articulating a precise <em>claim </em>that is backed up by textual <em>evidence. </em>Successful papers will also articulate the <em>motive, </em>answering the “So what?” question, explaining the implications of their argument.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe ask students to apply interpretive methods not only to the texts they read in class, but to their own writing. For instance, Wilhelm Dilthey’s concept of the hermeneutic circle tells us that we can understand a poem in its entirety only after we understand each line of the poem, yet we can understand any individual line only with a prior sense of the meaning of the whole poem. The interpretive process is circular: we must reread. As we teach our students, the writing process is similarly circular: we must rewrite. Student writers often do not discover their central claim until they reach their concluding paragraph. An ideal paper, though, should have an introduction that anticipates the conclusion. Assignments in University Writing are structured so that students keep the hermeneutic circle in mind when they write. Instructors will ask students, for instance, to do a series of pre-­draft exercises in which they must revise their claim as they consider more and more textual evidence. Just as strong reading requires a recursive method of analysis, strong writing requires a sense of harmony between part and whole that can only be realized by continual rewriting.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe hope that the essays you encounter in <em>The Morningside Review</em> reflect the values of University Writing. The essays engage ideas with energy and rigor; they make arguments that are both bold and nuanced. You’ll notice that these student writers strive to formulate original ideas while also placing their ideas in the context of ongoing scholarly conversations. We invite you to use these essays to deepen your own thinking and as inspiration for your own writing.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nAaron Ritzenberg, PhD\r\n\r\nAssociate Director, First-Year Writing', 'University Writing', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'university-writing', '', '', '2012-02-24 20:06:12', '2012-02-24 20:06:12', '', 129, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?page_id=369', 0, 'page', '', 0),

Hundreds of dejected, dispirited, and deprived young adults, fearful and confused, trudge across a beautifully landscaped plaza…. University of Virginia professor Mark Edmundson describes scenes almost as bleak on his campus and in his classroom. Edmundson believes that the capitalistic American way has created a “culture of consumption” which has imbedded itself deep within students’ psyches, stifling their ambitions and limiting their ability to think and act in individual and passionate ways (3-4). Edmundson names television as the key culprit in instigating this “culture of consumption.” The hypnotic lure of MTV and Oprah keeps Americans inside the fortified walls of their home, physically isolated from the real world. Our culture has changed. It is now time to encourage students to find their own direction, enabling the truest use of one of our most intrinsic human abilities, choice.\r\n\r\nThough television plays a large role, it is not solely to blame for the university campus being overrun by a zombotic population of students. Brazilian educational reformist, Paulo Freire, utilizes his experiences to explicate and criticize what he calls the “banking concept” of education. Within this system data is “deposited” into the student’s mind by teachers in a way that does not demand critical reflection upon that knowledge. Students are not encouraged to explore, reflect, and apply the information presented, they are merely allowed to “receive, memorize, and repeat” (Freire, 72).\r\n\r\nVeteran teacher John Taylor Gatto spent thirty years negotiating his way through crossfire in Manhattan’s public school system. Gatto’s experience illuminates many similarities between our public school system and Freire’s depiction of the oppressive “banking” pedagogy. As Gatto demonstrates, our educational system expects peaceful, patient, and absorbent behavior from students. Students are denied the opportunity to learn through rigorous discussion, individual problem solving, and critical thinking (1 –3). Brilliant ideas and deeper understanding often come from passionate exchange. Unfortunately, passionate exchange often provides nothing more than a one-way ticket to the Principal’s office. With this threat looming over students’ heads, they quickly learn to play the part expected…lumps of clay waiting to be molded.\r\n\r\nBut what exactly are students being molded into? Gatto asserts that the American educational system is designed to limit development, encourage “mediocre intellects,” debilitate the creative spirit, and mediate the capacity for “appreciable leadership skills” (4). American culture is a capitalistic culture. Capitalism requires capital, and capital requires the two things Gatto believes our school systems were created to produce: “employees and consumers” (6). This method of controlling the masses, fueling the work force, and creating a society more susceptible to consumption ultimately works to impede the development of young adults. Such debilitation leaves us with a school system that distributes high school diplomas to people who cannot even balance the checkbook that they are so often encouraged to use. It also creates a detached young culture that is vulnerably left to glean what life experience it can from the beguiling advertisements it is subjected to on television.\r\n\r\nMany present day college students are too young, too naïve, and too confused for college. It is not hard to believe Mark Edmundson’s claim that universities are filled with a one-dimensional passionless crop of students. One-dimension is all these young adults know. Observation is the only level of consciousness they have been allowed to achieve. Listen to the teacher and memorize what he has to say. Watch the television, and it will show you how society works. The mechanical distribution of classroom information in conjunction with the television at home has denied students the opportunity to step beyond observation and take action. Edmundson states, “The TV medium is inhospitable to inspiration, improvisation, failures, slipups. All must run perfectly” (3). However, living a life beyond observation—living an independent life with responsibilities to fulfill, decisions to make, and no one to blame or credit but yourself—will show you that inspiration, improvisation, failures, and slipups are integral, and often the most rewarding elements of life. Without inspiration there would be no art. Without improvisation there would be no surprise. Without failures there would be no heartache. Without slipups, there are few reality checks to encourage us to look at ourselves in a more levelheaded way. To deny these elements is to deny truly living life.\r\n\r\nThese are not things that can be “deposited” in the classroom, and they are not things that can be demonstrated while lounging on the living room sofa watching re-runs of Friends. Only truly experiencing life can answer such questions. This being the case, why are young adults not encouraged to live their own life and grasp a more firm hold on their wants and needs before they are sent to universities? Universities, where thousands of dollars are spent to prepare students for what they know nothing about; therefore cannot truly understand. Or more importantly, respect.\r\n\r\nDavid Denby, film critic for <em>The New Yorker</em>, writes about his experience of returning to Columbia after years of writing professionally and raising a family. Denby’s perspective is different the second time around. Living life has allowed an alternative through which he can interpret and understand the core curriculum that years before had left him apprehensive and disillusioned, yet not knowing why. This new perspective also has allowed Denby to see more clearly the state in which young students arrive in universities. Denby recounts the exhausting efforts made by Professor Edward Tayler as he struggled to move his students away from the “banking” method of education and encourage participation in the classroom. Tayler had to “trick” or “con” his students into contributing their thoughts and opinions to discussions (44). Denby describes these students as being confused. The pressures of society have hastily placed these young adults in an atmosphere that is contrary to the one they have been accustomed to. Their safe mechanical world, largely created by the educational system and consumerism, has been turned upside down and they have little independent life experience in which they can ground themselves. Denby recaps Tayler lecturing on “The Hermeneutic Circle.” This model asserts that words are merely words if you are not able to step back, and place them within a context. Yet there would be no context if there were no words. Both must work together if one is to truly understand a piece of literature. This method is not only critical to employ while reading; it is also critical in life (32). If there is no greater understanding of the world at large, there will be no true understanding for the reasons of data given in the classroom. The reverse is also true. The classroom and the world at large should work together in helping one understand how to lead a fulfilled life.\r\n\r\nYoung adults should not be rushed into college so quickly. Students straight out of high school, never having had the opportunity to experience life, frequently fail to break from the “banking” mentality. As I walk around my college campus I overhear students complaining about assignments they have been given. <em>This professor is so horrible! This assignment is completely unnecessary. I will never use this in life!</em> I want to scream, yes, you will! Perhaps the memory of specific content learned in the college classroom will fade, but the context in which you learn, the questions you have to raise, and the decisions you are encouraged to make are extremely beneficial lessons. The pressures of society push many young adults along, never allowing them the opportunity to come upon this realization.\r\n\r\nSix years ago, I was a dejected, dispirited, and deprived young adult trudging across a college campus complaining about the useless load of crap teachers felt the need to dump on me. I could not see the overarching importance—or the use—of knowledge I could gain from college. Throughout my life I was told what and how to think. I had not read any books or essays by Paulo Freire, or John Taylor Gatto, but I could have written pages about the “banking” method of education and the boredom and lifelessness it creates. I had not read an essay by Mark Edmundson. However, I was disturbed by the uniformity and lack of ambition in myself and in my peers. Public schools and the television did not provide me an opportunity to learn who I truly was or what I wanted. Instead I experienced the debilitation of the spirit and the limited development that John Taylor Gatto accuses the educational system of intentionally producing. I was miserable, confused, and angry. I needed something real. Faster than you could say college dropout, my bags were packed, and I was on my way to the most “real” place I could think of: New York City.\r\n\r\nIt was not until then that I started to live my life on my terms. I learned the importance of independence and individuality. The struggle, pleasure, and confusion that accompany adult responsibilities allowed me to begin the process of learning who I was, what I enjoyed, and what goals I wanted to achieve. However, after working and traveling for a few years I felt that there was still something missing. I needed more. I slowly began to realize that my mind was craving academic knowledge. This realization inspired an unexplainable and intense passion. In order to achieve my personal and professional goals I needed to be what John Taylor Gatto claimed capitalism feared most: an educated, independent, and creative thinker. For the first time I began to feel as though that useless load of crap did not have to be so useless. I was not clear exactly how, but I knew there was someway that I could utilize my life experience and make my education work for me. I had a passion to liberate myself by stepping beyond the state of observation and reaction that had been encouraged throughout my life and to take action.\r\n\r\nIt was time to walk across that campus once more. I knew the importance and weight of my decision, and that allowed me to bring something that was impossible to possess as an eighteen year old straight out of high school—Respect. I brought an immeasurable amount of respect for the knowledge I could gain, ways in which this knowledge could be of use, and the opportunities it could illuminate. My life experience created a deep passion. It was this passion that gave me a good reason to write those checks for over $20,000 a year in tuition.\r\n\r\nRational thought suggests that the media will not loosen its tight grip around the reins driving popular culture. It is unlikely that the educational system will change either; it seems to accomplish precisely what it what was created to accomplish. I do not claim to hold the key that would resolve the problems in our failing educational system. I do not know how to reverse the effects of consumerism. The only thing I claim to know is the importance of living your own life, and doing so at your own pace. No person should be pressured or forced to engage in what they do not understand. With that in mind I offer this to any miserable, confused, or angry young student: Live life, experience the world, find yourself, and do not decide what direction to continue until you can truly respect what will come from this choice.

(300, 5, '2011-12-19 08:06:23', '2011-12-19 08:06:23', 'One of the most popular practices amongst students at my high school was insulting Iowans. As denizens of a large, diverse suburb of Boston, we looked upon the hinterland residents as the antithesis of what we thought ourselves to be: cosmopolitan individuals who had seen people from all ends of the earth – and, for that matter, had seen a traffic light. Like my peers, I felt acquainted with diversity: I had traveled, had best friends of different races, and had, at one time, been one of only two Caucasian girls in my class. After a decade in a school system renowned for being a Noah’s Ark of ethnicities, I could recite plenty of facts about the beliefs, customs, and general idiosyncrasies of many parts of the world. Thanks to a curriculum with extensive units on civil rights and the Holocaust, I had had the dangers of exclusion and ethnocentrism hammered into me. I was wary of judging other cultures, determined to be open-minded, and desperate to avoid provincialism.\r\n\r\nYet something was awry. I couldn’t understand why a Chinese friend didn’t dare disobey her parents when they insisted she attend math camp, although it was clear the humanities were her forte. I was clueless as to why a boy in my biology class insisted on returning home to Israel over spring break, despite the disastrous bombings that were occurring almost daily. When my favorite history teacher spent a sabbatical year in Africa, I was resentful that I couldn’t be in his class, but also confused: he had already spent a number of years in Africa and I didn’t see why he needed to go back. Cosmopolitan, to me, meant Carrie Bradshaw’s cocktail of choice, not understanding, or knowledge, of the ways of the world.\r\n\r\nEvidently, despite all efforts, cross-cultural education at my school left many things to be desired. I wasn’t the only student who had trouble shedding divisions of nation and culture in order to relate to all people on a basic human level. How could my high school have done a better job of turning my peers and me into people with a true understanding and respect for humankind? How could it have created young adults, who, as Martha Nussbaum puts it, are “citizens of the world?” In her article of the same title, Nussbaum tries to provide the answers to this question. She discusses the necessity and value of being of being citizen of the world and how an effective cross-cultural education can help achieve this aim.\r\n\r\n“Citizens of the World” is a piece that stresses the commonality of all people. All people, writes Nussbaum, are defined not exclusively by our “national origin and group memberships” but as humans (52). In Nussbaum’s opinion, America’s educational system does not effectively teach this concept. This failure is especially injurious on the university level. While universities are designed to prepare students to be active participants in modern society, graduates still often lack the necessary tools needed to function as a world citizen. Globalization, and the consequential shrinking of the world, has made cross-cultural comfort one of the most important skills required of today’s young professionals. It is the function of multicultural education to prepare people for these new challenges that, while by definition modern, can be understood by looking toward the past.\r\n\r\nOne of Nussbaum’s techniques is to trace cross-cultural education through history, drawing upon the ideas of great thinkers and leaders. These ideas are far from outdated, but rather provide invaluable insight as to how cosmopolitanism can work today. Nussbaum focuses her discussion on ideas of world citizenship fostered by the ancient Greeks and Romans. Using these concepts as a “lens” with which to view my own cross-cultural education sheds light on some mistakes my high school made, and suggests how the school could have better achieved the goal of “[educating] people [so they] can operate as world citizens with sensitivity and understanding” (52).\r\n\r\nNussbaum writes about Diogenes the Cynic in order to address ideas about standard conventions and the dark underbelly of such powerful norms: prejudices toward the unconventional. One of the main goals of multicultural education at my school was to reduce prejudice; the curriculum reinforced the idea that “different isn’t necessarily wrong.” However, students never questioned what determined their concepts of right and wrong in the first place.\r\n\r\nThis need to examine the “conventional origins of judgments” (57) was missing from the curriculum. For one class, we read Maxine Hong Kingston’s <em>The Woman Warrior</em>, her coming-of-age tale as Chinese girl in America. This memoir closely examines the discrepancies between Chinese values and beliefs and American ones. Some of the ideas expressed by Kingston’s family, particularly her ultra-traditional mother, seemed irrational or unreasonable from an “American” perspective, such as strong ideas about ghosts or prominent ideas about female inferiority.\r\n\r\nDespite our urge to scoff at these ideas—believing in ghosts? obviously the woman wasn’t rational—my classmates and I accepted them. Our acceptance, however, stemmed more from a desire not to be seen as xenophobic or ethnocentric than from a true understanding of traditional Chinese logic. Students never detached themselves from their own beliefs in order to examine the origins of those beliefs, an exercise which would have provided valuable insights into both their own culture and the ones they were studying. According to Diogenes, the failure to take a step back from our own beliefs before studying the beliefs of others impairs cross-cultural understanding.\r\n\r\nDiogenes believed that to truly be a citizen of the world, we must “become, to a certain extent, philosophical exiles from our own way of life, seeing them from the vantage point of the outsider and asking the questions an outsider is likely to ask about their meaning and function” (58). Socrates echoed this idea by fervently espousing the examined life. Had students been encouraged to challenge the validity of their own beliefs, they might have viewed the practices of other societies as not just acceptable, but perhaps sometimes preferable, with their own merits and gifts.\r\n\r\nDiogenes also believed that one could evaluate a society’s institutions and practices in a non-biased fashion, by basing one’s judgment on the general idea of what is good for human beings. Nussbaum expands upon this point by discussing the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius. Marcus Aurelius said: “world citizenship does not, and should not, require that we suspend criticism toward other individuals and cultures” (65). Basic ideas of what is good or bad, right or wrong, stretch beyond biases and traditional culture-based beliefs to universal concepts of morality, as well as plain common sense.\r\n\r\nMy school, however, equated any sort of judgment on another society with prejudice and provincialism. Criticism of other cultures was discouraged. For example, in my Sophomore English class, we read Chinua Achebe’s <em>Things Fall Apart</em>, a seminal novel set in an African community called the Igbo. The class spent plenty of time discussing the cultural differences between the Igbo culture and our own society, such as the varied religious rituals or the distinctions in family life. But Things Fall Apart is also replete with intense violence that, while still found in our society, is not condoned as it is in Igbo culture. Atrocities in the book, such as spousal abuse or fratricide, were always chalked up to the individual; blame was never placed on the society itself.\r\n\r\nThe result of this was that when students encountered an action or institution that seemed unjust or unreasonable, they invalidated their own morals by attributing their concept of “wrong” to the society in which they had been raised. Our basic morals, which we derive from our humanness and not from our culture, were devalued as time and time again it was emphasized that values and ideas come from nurture, not nature. Marcus Aurelius would have reminded my teachers, classmates, and I that “the world citizen can be very critical of unjust actions or policies, and of the character of the people who promote them” (65). To know that adjudication is possible without necessarily being racist or prejudiced would have put students more at ease in their multicultural studies, enabling them to take in information, but also to truly process and analyze it.\r\n\r\nMuch of the criticism that the students felt was impermissible to turn on other cultures was turned back on America.. In my junior year American literature class, most students felt free to attack our own country and history to no end; we read<em>The Scarlet Letter</em> and tore apart Puritan society. We read <em>The Glass Menagerie</em>and mercilessly mocked the culture of the South. I was shocked when I learned that some schools recited the Pledge of Allegiance each morning; I did not even know the Pledge of Allegiance. Many students felt that supporting something American meant rejecting something global, which was precisely what we had been taught not to do. At the risk of making the same platitudinous statement that countless others have applied to the experience of 9/11, that day and the events that unfolded afterwards forced us to rethink what it meant to be American.\r\n\r\nStudents like myself, who believed national identity to be inherently prejudiced and dangerous, were compelled to change from people with a global, albeit flawed, identity to “Americans.” Yet due to our nebulous national identities, this transformation would take us along a rocky path. The Stoics understood the importance of national, ethnic, and/or religious identity, and, more importantly, knew that it was not mutually exclusive with a global one. My schoolmates, on the other hand, did not always seem to know this. This was demonstrated by the panic in our school system caused by the fact that, despite all efforts, students always self-segregated by race or ethnicity. The administration’s efforts to get all the students to mingle with each other failed miserably: the cafeteria remained a collection of territories, with the Black kids reigning over the space near the door and the Russians entrenched in the back. Very little value was placed on the benefits of spending time with, or being close to, people who shared one’s identity. We often felt that patriotism was unimportant, and that connecting with members of our own religious, ethnic, or racial groups was somehow shameful. Att the end of the day, despite the guilt one might have felt over only connecting with students of other cultures in the classroom or on the playing field, it was always the kids with whom you attended confirmation class, or the ones whose first language was the same as yours, who became your closest friends.\r\n\r\nThe Stoics would argue that “love for what is near (is) a fundamental human trait, and a highly rational way to comport oneself as a citizen” (61). I understood this every time I participated in a youth event at my synagogue, which often filled me with a warm sense of inclusion and belonging. My Jewish identity, however, was a trait I subconsciously kept hidden in public school. I feared anything that might separate me from the homogeneous masses, anything that might be seen as a liability in my quest to remain as neutral as Switzerland. And I was among the lucky ones: students who didn’t participate in such institutions as Hebrew School got far less opportunity to truly fit in than I. When these opportunities arose I felt both a member of something inclusive and a part of a larger whole, a point at the center of concentric circles.\r\n\r\nEvery year around Martin Luther King Day, members from a local church would come to Friday night services at my synagogue, and afterwards, the gospel choir gave a performance that year after year awed the entire congregation. As I sat there listening to the beautiful voices, I was still aware of the divisions in the room: black and white, Jewish and Christian. But the differences seemed miniscule compared to the overarching feeling of commonality: not only were we all humans, but both groups had faced prejudice and persecution, and continued to fight these forces. This was the kind of identity-centered experience that made me more open to others, but that I always had to look outside my school to find.\r\n\r\nEvaluating my educational experience by looking at historical ideas provides clues to how my school could have more effectively created “citizens of the world.” However, it is a difficult and complex process for one to translate the ideas of Diogenes, Marcus Aurelius, Socrates, or the Stoics into a multicultural curriculum. Studying these thinkers won’t inform a school administrator as to how to spread cross-cultural studies across a variety of academic subjects, or how to ensure that the school’s faculty has expertise in the material. Martha Nussbaum knows this, and in her effort to champion her own ideas of the ideal educational program, she thus looks beyond history to contemporary educational institutions that, in her opinion, have the right idea.\r\n\r\nNussbaum, for example, examines St. Lawrence University and SUNY Buffalo in order to crystallize her ideas about how cross-cultural education can be implemented, taking into consideration pragmatic roadblocks. The use of this additional lens succeeds in transforming her ideas from purely theoretical ones to those which are more practical. Yet the recommendations that Nussbaum makes based on the examples of colleges like St. Lawrence are still unrealistically ideal. For example, not all schools can afford to have their faculty move temporarily to India or Kenya in order to be able to impart firsthand knowledge to their students, as St. Lawrence did (80). By examining her topic from this practical perspective as well as a theoretical one, Nussbaum shows that no matter how much a study of history might validate pursuit of cross-cultural education at all costs, sometimes the concrete costs of multicultural immersion are more than every educational institution can afford. But even if they can’t send teachers to do fieldwork Africa or Asia, schools can take smaller-scale measures to make sure that their educators exemplify the citizen of the world perspective that they seek to impart to students.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate goal of cross-cultural education is not simply to impart knowledge of other cultures, nor is it to abolish stereotypes, nor is it even to have students empathize with all humans. Adequate achievement of these aims can still leave us with people who accept and understand cosmopolitanism, but who do not see its value. As Nussbaum says,\r\n<blockquote>It is up to us as educators, to show our students the beauty and interest of a life that is open to the whole world, to show them that there is after all more joy in the kind of citizenship that questions than in the kind that simply applauds, more fascination in the study of human beings in all their real variety and complexity than in the zealous pursuit of superficial stereotypes..... (84).</blockquote>\r\nNussbaum believes that the objective of cross-cultural education isn’t just to help the hypothetical (NB: aspiring? future? putative?) young professional with an international career, but to excite her, to spark her interest, to help her achieve a life she loves. With the ancient Greek and Roman ideas of world citizenship, a few contemporary examples of cross-cultural education done well, and Nussbaum’s prescription for joy mixed in, schools like the one I attended can truly teach their students to be citizens of the world.

(301, 8, '2012-03-01 16:30:53', '2012-03-01 16:30:53', 'For millennia words were humanity’s most accurate way of recording and remembering history. But in the last 150 years, the world has come to take for granted what Roland Barthes called the “evidential force” of the photographic image, its ability to show us a slice of reality, something that once was. Documentary photographers and photojournalists have provided us with what we consider the most persuasive form of historical evidence, and we rely on such reporters and their documents to bring us information about important events and situations around the world. But like words, images can relate fact or fiction. And as with words, our understanding of the veracity of images is largely determined by the genre in which they are used. In recent years changing journalistic ideals and technologies have contributed to the emergence of an increasingly subjective, cinematic style of journalism, and as a result the status of the image as a reliable historical document is being compromised. As it becomes ever more difficult to distinguish fact from fiction we run the serious risk of assuming the role of a mere audience in a world that desperately needs our active participation.\r\n\r\nUntil the 1920s cameras were large and awkward devices, but the release of the Leica, a lightweight, portable camera, in 1925 enabled the modern field of photojournalism to emerge. The desire to represent important moments with pictures is an ancient impulse seen in drawings, paintings, and engravings, but with “fast” cameras like the Leica came the possibility of actually capturing moments in a mechanical, scientific, and seemingly objective manner. Photographers began to exploit the speed of the camera to capture, for the first time in history, “candid” images, images that were not posed (Davenport 96). Along with the new cameras came a new philosophy that photographs should, and could, capture the immediate truth of an objective reality.\r\nThe “documentary” genre that emerged from this philosophy shot from a head-on, eye-level angle, in sharp focus, without elaborate composition, and with natural light. The documentary style seemed to eliminate most of the subjective interference and artistic pretension of the photographer. This documentary style became the default for photojournalism and is still the style we associate with news. Photojournalists, documentary photographers who intend their work for publication, quickly became important fixtures in news organizations as the public clamored for new and interesting images of the world. The years leading up to World War II saw the rise of professional photojournalism, and with the introduction of Life magazine in 1936, documentary photographs became equal to words as America’s source of information (Davenport 98).\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_111" align="alignright" width="250" caption="Figure1"]<img class="size-full wp-image-111 " title="Figure1" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Figure1.jpg" alt="Figure1" width="250" height="261" />[/caption]\r\n\r\nAt the end of World War II it would be through the medium of photography that Americans would come to fully understand the evil they had been battling. Images from Nazi concentration camps were irrefutable proof that the war had been necessary and just. Margaret Bourke-White’s photograph (Fig. 1) of a woman covering her face to avoid looking at a heap of dead bodies is one of the most disturbing and compelling images from the camps. It is also an example of the important attributes of good photojournalism. Unlike most of Bourke-White’s photographs, which tend to be stylized and dramatically lit (Fig. 2 &amp; 3), this image is shot in the straightforward documentary style. The photographer does not aestheticize the scene. There is a simple reporting of facts: the dead bodies, the MP’s, the civilians. The only missing information is supplied by the caption, “German civilians made to face their nation’s crime, Bauchenwald, 1945” (Callahan 128). This objectivity allows the viewer to make a variety of interpretations: the woman is horrified by what has happened, she is unwilling to accept what she sees, her refusal to look represents the willful blindness of the German people to the Nazi’s activities. As in real life, the exact meaning of the scene, and the appropriate reaction to it, are left for the viewer to determine. Bourke-White’s image acts on the viewer much the way the real scene might. First there is the recognition of something altogether wrong, something hideously unnatural. Then disbelief sets in (Are they dead? Is it real?), followed by shock, disgust, rage, and finally sorrow, a sorrow filled with the grim acceptance of the truth of the image and the world it captures.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_110" align="alignright" width="250" caption="Figure2"]<img class="size-full wp-image-110 " title="Figure2" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Figure2.jpg" alt="Figure2" width="250" height="170" />[/caption]\r\n\r\nBourke-White’s image documents a specific event in which Germans were forced to view Bauchenwald, and at the same time stands as a representative image of the larger history of the Holocaust and WWII. The photographic style makes it a strong historical document on both accounts. Documentary style images appear “realistic,” that is as objective reportings of actual situations, to which the photograph bears witness. This realism allows the viewer to see past the medium of the photograph itself, into the content of the scene depicted. In the mind of the viewer the image becomes equal to the event, and the photograph then plays on the emotions as if it were real. The photograph can act, says Susan Sontag, “[as] a means of making ‘real’ (or more ‘real’) matters that the privileged and the merely safe might prefer to ignore” (7). The power of the documentary image lies in its ability to elicit from the viewer an “active response,” rather than passive acceptance or mere voyeurism (Sontag 81). The photograph, any photograph, is a window onto a world. The photographic style is a key component in determining whether we perceive that world as our own—real, factual, historical—world, or some other—unreal, fictional, imaginary—world. Only when the image is perceived as factual can it carry the full weight of an historical document, and ensure that we will remember the reality of the event depicted.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_109" align="alignright" width="212" caption="Figure3"]<img class="size-full wp-image-109 " title="Figure3" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Figure3.jpg" alt="Figure3" width="212" height="250" />[/caption]\r\n\r\nThe fact that there is nothing special, aesthetically speaking, about Bourke-White’s image gives it added credibility as a document. There is no rule that a photojournalist’s work cannot be beautiful. But a beautiful image is typically associated with the efforts of an artist. Since art is sometimes thought of as subjective self-expression, the goals of an artist might seem to interfere with the journalistic ideal of objective factual reporting. What is important here is not whether these goals do necessarily interfere, nor whether the photographer is an artist or a journalist—I believe he can be both. The value of an historical document is derived from the relationship between the document and the viewer. If a photograph that is dramatically composed and lit gives the appearance of having been orchestrated or manipulated by the photographer, or if the composition appears to be implying an opinion or romantic vision, it cannot be equated with an objective factual reality. Since this equating is what gives the photograph its weight as a document, the belief of the viewer is the primary factor in determining the historical authority of an image. While not inherently incompatible with journalism, beauty can easily conflict with and overshadow substance, particularly in a medium that is by its nature biased toward appearances.* An image that is not as “good” is less likely to seem planned or manufactured, and is therefore seemingly more objective, hence more believable as a document.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_108" align="alignright" width="250" caption="Figure4"]<img class="size-full wp-image-108 " title="Figure4" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Figure4.jpg" alt="Figure4" width="250" height="165" />[/caption]\r\n\r\nThe power and truth of an image seem to lie more in the murky waters of human psychology than in the objective properties of the image itself. According to art historian John Tagg the acceptability of an image as an historical document has very little to do with its visual style. In his book The Burden of Representation, Tagg asserts that our belief in the factual nature of the documentary genre is a culturally defined convention (8-10, 103, 119). He argues that the acceptance of certain types of images as forms of historical evidence stems from their adoption and dissemination by respected governmental and private institutions, such as law enforcement agencies and newspaper publishers, who presented these images as accurate representations of reality. It is not, according to Tagg, the authority of the image that makes it a valid historical document, but the authority of the institution that legitimizes the image (4, 63, 76, 118). Over time we have, as a society, been conditioned to accept documentary style images as accurate representations of reality, but the documentary style is just a genre, and we might, Tagg implies, have accepted a different visual style as “realistic.”\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_107" align="alignright" width="250" caption="Figure5"]<img class="size-full wp-image-107 " title="Figure5" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Figure5.jpg" alt="Figure5" width="250" height="164" />[/caption]\r\n\r\nTagg’s is an interesting perspective to take when examining the work of contemporary photographer Sebastião Salgado. Salgado is considered by some the most talented documentary photographer working today. For the last sixteen years he has been taking pictures of suffering: suffering caused by civil war, oppression, and famine. Yet because of the extreme beauty of many of his images, Salgado has been accused of making art out of the suffering of others. He has said, “What I want in my pictures is not that they’ll look like art objects. They are journalist pictures. All my pictures. No exceptions” (Harris 160). During 1984-85 Salgado was in the Sahel region of Africa, where refugees from Ethiopia’s civil war were being killed, not by violence, but by famine. While in some of his photographs Salgado employs a straightforward documentary style to great journalistic effect (Fig. 4 &amp; 5), in others his framing, composition, and aesthetic decisions seem to reject the notion that there is any boundary between subjective art and objective journalism. Salgado does not differentiate between his different types of images, and in displaying his photographs side by side he indicates to the viewer that they are of equal journalistic importance.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_106" align="alignright" width="250" caption="Figure6"]<img class="size-full wp-image-106 " title="Figure6" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Figure6.jpg" alt="Figure6" width="250" height="164" />[/caption]\r\n\r\nOne of Salgado’s most famous images (Fig. 6), the first of 29 prints in his photo essay from the Sahel, of what appears to be a group of nomads crossing the desert, has an epic, cinematic quality to it. As he often does, Salgado frames his subjects on the edge of a barren landscape, isolating them and making them seem alone in a vast, empty world. Wrapped in blankets his nomads are like natural objects, pillars of rock or sand. This serves to create a frozen quality that is common to Salgado’s images. It seems as though his figures have been standing forever, as if time had stopped thousands of years ago while the Jews were still wandering the desert, and this image is of that unchanging, eternal moment. The image has no internal clues as to its context, either in time or in location. The wrapped figure on the right, we cannot tell if it is a man or a woman, clearly resonates with images of the Madonna (Fig. 7). It even appears that there is a child being held underneath her cloak. If we focus on this character, we can see that she has an aura, or glow. The sky to the far left and right of the Madonna figure is a much darker shade of gray than what surrounds her. And this aura extends below the horizon, down around the edges of the subject. The only natural cause for this odd lighting might be if the sun were directly behind the figure. Yet it is clear from the highlights that the sun is to the left of the subjects and low in the sky. The cloth on the left edge of the Madonna figure, however, seems darker than it should be, and is not picking up the same highlight as the other figures. Though there is no way to prove it, this aura appears to be the product of work done in the darkroom.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_105" align="alignright" width="250" caption="Figure7"]<img class="size-full wp-image-105 " title="Figure7" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Figure7.jpg" alt="Figure7" width="250" height="176" />[/caption]\r\n\r\nNYU professor and curator Fred Ritchin has said that “while respecting the facts of the situation, Salgado attempts to re-create, through visual metaphor, what he sees as its essential human drama—the invisible made visible” (147). One wonders if Salgado embeds the Christian symbolism consciously and purposefully, or if it simply arises from the “invisible” world he brings forth. Ritchin goes on to suggest that Salgado, a Brazilian, “[is] with other Latin Americans drawn to what has been called a ‘magical realism’” (147). His photograph of an emaciated boy standing in the desert, leaning on a cane (Fig. 8) is an example of an image whose documentary value is intermingled with its magical qualities. The boy’s physical condition, the dead tree, and the barren landscape seem, as a documentary statement, to be about drought, famine, poverty, hardship. But as in the previous image there is a narrative, cinematic quality. The boy’s cane, and his skeletal features give him the dual appearance of child and old man. The analogy of the boy with the tree, and the fact that the boy is naked, again make the subject feel like part of the natural environment. The frozen feeling and the completely unified white background give this image an otherworldly quality. The subject stands erect, poised, proud, staring out at what we can only assume to be more emptiness. Salgado’s subject becomes the sole human journeying through this vast other universe which is somehow natural, yet eternal and transcendent.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_104" align="alignright" width="166" caption="Figure 8"]<img class="size-full wp-image-104 " title="Figure 8" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Figure8.jpg" alt="Figure 8" width="166" height="250" />[/caption]\r\n\r\nThe above photographs cannot be said to employ the documentary style. Yet Salgado is considered, and considers himself, a documentary photographer and photojournalist. Salgado’s story is more subjective and his images more beautiful than most documentary work. But does that mean that his photographs are less reliable as historical documents? The answer is that Salgado is not, for the most part, concerned with documenting the obvious or apparent circumstances of his subjects. He seeks to tell the story not of the individuals he photographs, nor of their broader situation, but of what he seems to see as a universal human story of suffering and spiritual transcendence. It is Salgado’s story, a parable drawn from Latin American Catholic influences, but certainly not journalism or documentary photography as it is normally understood. Salgado is like a writer who mixes journalism, editorial, and fiction in the same book and leaves it to his readers to understand the difference. That Salgado is considered a documentary photographer raises the question of what it means at this moment in time to document reality.\r\n\r\nI believe that Salgado’s style is indicative of a changing tolerance in what is being accepted as real, and at the same time a changing understanding of what reality is. And these are not changes for the better. New forms of media have altered the conventional social understanding of what represents factual reality. Flipping television channels we go from Fox News (reality?), to "Law and Order" “ripped from the headlines” (fiction?), to "Survivor" (reality television?). On television, as in Salgado’s images, there is no clear way to define where fact ends and fiction begins. Keeping in mind Tagg’s argument that different visual styles might be accepted as real, it is possible, and I think probable, that Salgado’s magical, or spiritual realism is a style that to him best represents reality. His photographs record subjective reality, and are in that sense documentary and historical, but not journalistic.\r\n\r\nIf his images are accepted as real, if they are truly equated with reality, then they may represent a new convention, a new type of historical document. Yet the magical realism, epic landscapes, perfect lighting and framing (and perhaps special effects) of Salgado’s photographs have a cinematic quality. And like films they seem real in a way that reality is not—better, more interesting, and importantly, more bearable. There is no violence, no horror, no struggle that is too much for a movie viewer to bear. If journalism looks like film it allows us to suspend our disbelief, when we should in fact be (as with the Bourke-White image) confronting our disbelief. For images “to alter conduct,” Susan Sontag argues, “they must shock” (81). But images such as Salgado’s trigger our movie viewing persona, one that expects and accepts violence, destruction, and suffering. In the majority of Salgado’s images, the form overwhelms the content, and the vital step of equating the image with reality does not take place.\r\n\r\nAs we continue to gain more of our factual information from television, the television style image will replace the documentary image as the default indicator of reality. Wide screen, High Definition televisions, which will soon be ubiquitous, will give television a more cinematic appearance, and as “films” begin to be shot on High Definition video (rather than film) the difference in aesthetic quality between television and film will largely dissolve. Salgado’s style of documentary is a precursor to what will become an epic, cinematic style of journalism, which will not clearly separate fact from fiction.\r\n\r\nJournalistic objectivity may be an arbitrary convention, a form of subjectivity unconsciously agreed upon as representing truth. Yet even if that is the case the maintenance of a conventional means of depicting true events is absolutely necessary for a morally functional society. Words and images are our only means of conveying complex information. While we have rules of logic for language, there are no such rules for images. Without a conventional standard for veracity, communication becomes the meaningless shuffling of symbols. For decades the documentary style image has been the standard for truth, but as artists like Salgado appropriate and incorporate this style into a subjective documentary genre, our journalism and our world will become more beautiful and less real, and photography will lose its power to represent reality, and to elicit an active response. If photographic documents do not act on us as if they were real, if images like Bourke-White’s are seen as fiction rather than fact, than we will lose the power and knowledge of our history. And will be doomed to repeat it.\r\n\r\n* I am not arguing that art must always be beautiful, only that a visual image that is beautiful conforms to what is typcially understood as an artist''s goal. A beautiful painting does not happen by chance, the way a beautiful photograph can, and many paintings we see are beautiful. Therefore, whether or not it is true in the case of a photograph, we may be tempted to equate beauty with design, which affects the viewer''s beliefs about an given image.\r\n<h2>Images</h2>\r\nCallahan, Sean.

(302, 5, '2011-12-19 08:07:30', '2011-12-19 08:07:30', 'Her face was plastered on every magazine in the country, the camouflage of her jacket bringing out the brown of her eyes. As bombs fell on Iraq, killing thousands of civilians, the survival of one woman rose above all death counts to symbolize glory, hope, and freedom. People across America held their breaths during her captivity and rejoiced when she came home. Our reaction to Private Jessica Lynch’s story speaks volumes about our voracious appetite for sentimentality, as well as the ubiquitous influences of the media and war propaganda. The treatment of this case reflects the tendencies towards sentimentality and symbolization described by Joan Didion in her essay “Sentimental Journeys”; it also exemplifies ideas about war propaganda voiced by H. Bruce Franklin in his piece “From Realism to Virtual Reality: Images of America’s Wars.” Didion and Franklin both discuss the way in which reality can be spun, or downright ignored, to mislead the public. The two authors criticize the extreme power of the media and other institutions to shape our perceptions, both through altering truths and g outright lies.\r\n\r\nIn April 2003, the Pentagon stated that Jessica Lynch had been rescued from an Iraqi hospital in a daring display of American military valor. The media then ran with that heroic story to turn Lynch’s tale into one of the most sentimental episodes of the war. An article in the New York Post, for example, was shamelessly headlined “How Daring Midnight Ballet Brought Back Pfc. Jessica From The Enemy''s Evil Clutches” and went on to describe Lynch’s rescue as something out of a Tom Clancy novel (Latham and Sujo). It was not surprising that both the government and the media made an exceedingly big deal out of such an incident. It is not uncommon for a disproportionate amount of attention to be paid to a figure in current events who stands out by being young, attractive, and female. This treatment of Lynch’s story evokes memories of a similar event that was also tremendously sentimentalized: the Central Park Jogger case. Like the story of the Jogger, in which a young woman was brutally attacked in the park in 1989, Jessica Lynch’s story ballooned, thanks to a number of factors, from the wealth of article titles that played off Saving Private Ryan and Kissing Jessica Stein, to the iconic photo of a smiling Jessica in her fatigues against a backdrop of the American flag.\r\n\r\nIn her essay “Sentimental Journeys,” which examines the Jogger incident, Joan Didion writes, “Crimes are universally understood to be news to the extent that they offer, however erroneously, a story, a lesson, a higher concept” (255-256). The Jessica Lynch incident was a story better than fiction, and the media was determined to tell that story for maximum effect. It tugged heartstrings by voyaging beyond Lynch’s capture and rescue, delving into the heart and soul of the petite blonde who wanted to be an elementary school teacher, just as fourteen years earlier the media had highlighted the jogger’s “top-notch work” and her fun-loving personality (Didion 253). The two women, both undue victims and miraculous survivors, were turned into symbols—the jogger of what was right with New York, and Lynch of what was right with America. The story of Jessica Lynch’s ordeal, replete with teary-eyed mothers and picture-perfect reunion, ranks right up there with the Central Park Jogger’s story as one of the most sentimental narratives in recent memory.\r\n\r\nIn “Sentimental Journeys,” Didion claims, “cases are widely regarded by the American reporters as windows on the city or culture in which they take place” (308). Jayson Blair, the New York Times reporter who was later accused of plagiarism, used Lynch’s story as a window into Appalachia. In an article that he claimed was based on interviews witly, Blair wrote:\r\n\r\nMr. Lynch seemed distracted as he stood on the porch of his hilltop home here looking into the tobacco fields and pastures. He talked about the satellite television service that brought CNN and other cable news networks into his home, his family''s long history of military service and the poor condition of the local economy ("Relatives”).\r\n\r\nIts promise of giving Americans insight into a region of the country few people knew much about was one of the reasons why Jessica Lynch’s story was a media goldmine. Reporters edged their way into the tight-knit Lynch family, invading their home in an attempt to show the rest of the country about the environment from which Jessica hailed. The “opportunity to enter not only households but parts of the culture normally closed” was another factor that made the Lynch case so susceptible to becoming a sentimental, overexposed narrative (Didion 308).\r\n\r\nBut Lynch’s story has another aspect to it, besides being an archetypal tale about the trials and tribulations of a young white female and a window into a relatively unseen culture: it’s a war story. Lynch was fashioned into the type of propagandist symbol that has long characterized American military conflicts. In “From Realism to Virtual Reality: Images of America’s Wars,” H. Bruce Franklin discusses the historical use of these propaganda techniques, which have proven to be especially potent in controversial wars such as those in Vietnam and Iraq. Lynch’s ordeal not only helped garner support for US involvement in Iraq, but it embedded in the minds of Americans a concrete image of the people who had been deployed there. Lynch was an example of how the government wanted all soldiers to be seen: as kind and caring, patriotic and passionate.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Lynch helped show that the military was not a selfish institution that sent young people towards danger or death without giving them something in return. The military had done great things for Jessica Lynch: it had provided her with a means of escape from stifling, rural West Virginia; it had allowed her to travel the world; and it would fund a college education that would enable her better to serve society. She was the perfect symbol of all that could be gained from joining the military. The US army could not have picked a better poster girl.\r\n\r\nWhen the celebration over Lynch’s rescue died down, it became evident that many of the “facts” in the story were closer to fiction. For example, injuries that the Pentagon claimed Lynch sustained by fighting against Iraqi soldiers turned out to be the result of a Hummer crash. Furthermore, Lynch had been “imprisoned” in a hospital devoid of Iraqi military personnel, where she was assigned the only specialist bed in the hospital and one of only two nurses on the floor (Kampfner). Confronted with public distrust in both itself and the Pentagon, the media were driven to reexamine what had occurred.\r\n\r\nRevisiting the details of this incident allowed the media to prove its commitment to the truth. <em>The New York Times</em> tackled the alteration of Lynch’s story in an article correcting the untruths propagated by Jayson Blair. In the correction, Jessica Lynch’s sister Brandi said that Blair’s assertion that tobacco fields and cattle pastures were visible from the porch of the Lynch home was completely false (“Correcting the Record”). By drawing attention to such inaccuracies, the <em>New York Times</em> convinced its readers that it was concerned with the truth, and that all the propaganda machines and corrupt journalists in the world would not stop it from continuing to serve the reader; the newspaper came off as honorable, despite the fact that it had misled the public in the first place.\r\n\r\nOther media outlets criticized not themselves but their peers in their attempt to gain the public’s trust. When CBS was criticized for pitching a massive multimedia deal to Lynch’s family while she was still hospitalized, the network defended itself by saying, “Unlike the <em>New York Times</em>'' own ethical problems, there is no question about the accuracy or integrity of CBS News'' reporting” (Haberman). Some of the proposed ideas that made CBS so desperate for the rights to tell Lynch’s story included a TV movie through it’s “movie division, which specializes in inspirational stories of courage" (Haberman) and an MTV concert in Lynch’s honor, to be aired from her hometown. While CBS might not have committed outright plagiarism, their aggression, their shameless pursuit of the story’s rights, and their apparent determination to make a profit from the incident were far from innocent. But through the use of statements that insulted the <em>New York Times</em>, CBS helped detract the blame from itself and disguise the fact that it was just as eager as Blair to sentimentalize and sensationalize Lynch''s story.\r\n\r\nNewpapers and networks are not the only ones to have twisted the truth about Lynch’s rescue. By having a hidden camera film the Navy SEALS operation that released Lynch from the Iraqi hospital, the military did just as much to make Lynch’s rescue into an exciting story as any network. As one writer put it, “"It was like a Hollywood film. [The soliders] cried, ''Go, go, go'', with guns and blanks and the sound of explosions. They made a show--an action movie like Sylvester Stallone or Jackie Chan, with jumping and shouting, breaking down doors. All the time with the camera rolling” (Kampfner). Many people were angered by the excessive importance placed on taping the rescue, as Franklin argues, reflecting their disapproval of the role of photographers and videographers in the midst of war. He describes a comic book published after the Vietnam War that depicted photojournalists as villains screaming “Keep shooting, keep shooting!” (Franklin 61). This double entendre criticizes the emphasis placed on getting good images, a goal that can overshadow the true purpose of a mission. The Pentagon’s determination to videotape Lynch’s rescue, and its similar resolve to acquire high-quality photos and videos of the conflict in Vietnam, suggest that the military’s priorities lay not so much in the actual conduct of war but in its portrayal. The military is just as much at fault as the networks for turning war into a sometimes heartwarming, sometimes horrific narrative.\r\n\r\nJessica Lynch’s story will be retold in November 2003, when NBC’s made-for-TV movie “Saving Private Lynch” is broadcast into homes across America. Movies have long been used to change our ideas of historical events, and, as Franklin notes, such movies and stories are “an effective vehicle for romanticizing and popularizing war” (53). Many movies about the Vietnam War, for example, sought to “reverse the roles of victim and victimizer” (Franklin 59) and to “radically [reimagine] the war” (Franklin 57). The pervasive feeling surrounding “Saving Private Lynch,” as expressed in an abundance of news articles in the Fall of 2003, is that the movie will likely veer from reality.\r\n\r\nTo defend itself, the media has directly addressed this negative publicity. The writer of the script said in an interview:\r\n\r\nI had to give the network attorneys the information in every scene as to what exact magazine, what exact article, what page I got the content from. That went to the legal department with a photocopy of the articles. They then would double- and triple-check what version could be O.K. to use ("Saving Private Lynch").\r\n\r\nFasano’s disclaimer-filled comments, in which he goes so far as to say “Please . . . Don’t shoot the messenger,” seek to defend the media’s versions of events (“Saving Private Lynch”). But while this version may claim to be painstakingly researched, when the movie airs we will likely be presented with a sensationalized, twisted story. No one is going to make a movie about an America POW in no imminent danger, being given TLC by Iraqi nurses, which is the plotline that the facts about Lynch’s capture actually point to. The history of war movies, as Franklin says, is a history of skewed reality, and “Saving Private Lynch”is not expected to be any different.\r\n\r\nCriticizing the truth-twisting tactics employed by the government gave both the public and the media an opportunity to make opinionated statements about the conflict in Iraq. In a time when the Dixie Chicks were vilified for one anti-Bush comment, attacking the Lynch incident was safer than attacking the country, government, or president in general. Analyzing the holes in the story was a way of expressing disapproval of the war. Just as Jessica Lynch was a positive symbol for the war and the military, the skewing of her story became a negative symbol for the lies surrounding the war. Throughout the course of the war, numerous statements of arguable legitimacy had been thrown at the American public, mainly concerning Iraq’s possession of chemical and biological weapons. Many people expressed their general outrage at these widespread lies by focusing on the Lynch case as a specific example of this deception.\r\n\r\nIn a <em>New York Times</em> editorial, Nicholas Kristoff wrote that the public had been “misled” by reports that Lynch had fired at her captors, that she had been seriously injured, etc., commenting that, “As a citizen, I deeply resent my government trying to spin me like a Ping-Pong ball” (“Saving Private Jessica”). The resentment of this one event, as expressed in the numerous editorials and letters like Kristoff’s, allowed people to vocalize their overall resentment of the war. Lynch’s ordeal became a sounding board for those who felt the war itself was unjust.\r\n\r\nAs new facts come to light, and Jessica Lynch’s story is retold in new ways, the media’s portrayal of the story has been challenged. Perhaps the greatest power to retell the story belongs to Lynch herself. Lynch, who recently was honorably discharged from the army, has already signed a book deal. The Central Park Jogger, who came forth and identified herself as a woman named Trisha Meili, told her story in last year’s memoir,<em> I Am The Central Park Jogger</em>. We cannot know in advance whether Lynch’s account of her ordeal will veer towards sentimentality or hard cold facts, whether it will exalt or denounce the US military. But a story is a multi-dimensional object, a confluence of many sources of information. The stories of Lynch and Meili are already engraved in our minds in ways that their own words may be powerless to alter. When the media presents us with a packaged story that is complete with excitement and closure, then a woman suffering from amnesia (like both Lynch and Meili), despite her position as the story’s heroine, is almost powerless to unwrap that package and shine her on what’s inside.\r\n\r\nJessica Lynch has been called many things: an icon, a heroine, a “wholesome West Virginia country girl” (Linda Davies, qtd. in Jehl and Blair). In the years to come her story will no doubt be told and retold, made into legend and attacked with fervor. But what will not change, regardless of the books published and movies made, is the power the incident had over the American public in 2003, as our country engaged in a conflict that promised to end quickly but instead dragged on mercilessly. As both a propaganda tool and a sentimental narrative, Lynch demonstrated just how capable the government and media are of selling us an alternative version of the truth. Cases like hers might harm our trust in reported news, but considering our insatiable appetite for great stories, we cannot expect the news to cut back on how much fiction it reports as fact. The next time we go to war, or the next time a young woman survives a harrowing ordeal, the truth will no doubt continue to be molded and manipulated to our liking. That is how it has been for hundred of years, and how it will continue to be.', 'Spins, Sentiment, and Sensationalism: The Jessica Lynch Story', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'spins-sentiment-and-sensationalism-the-jessica-lynch-story-by-kayla-rachlin-small', '', '', '2012-03-23 15:50:34', '2012-03-23 15:50:34', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=302', 0, 'essay', '', 0);

(428, 8, '2012-03-23 15:53:34', '2012-03-23 15:53:34', '<em>Saturday Night Live</em> is infamous for its humor, which walks the line between social commentary and pure amusement. While its performers and characters have been able to use the show as a platform for future successes in comedy, few have had as great success and notoriety as the Lonely Island. Perhaps better known for their front man, Andy Samberg, the Lonely Island is a group of three friends: Samberg, Akiva Schaffer, and Jorma Taccone. The three produce, direct, and star in a series of digital shorts, or music videos, that appear on the show. In 2009 they released their first album of songs, which has been labeled by providers as comedy.\n\nTheir success is likely due to the forward nature of their work. Their songs, delivered as parodies of hip-hop, R&amp;B, and rap, range from love poems to Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to tales of premature ejaculation. “Lazy Sunday,” the group’s breakout video from 2005 featuring Samberg and SNL cast member Chris Parnell, is surprising. The loud, threatening backbeat brings to mind rattling chains. Their words are shouted at the camera, which hides the message at first. No, the two are not rapping about the ills of the South Bronx or Brooklyn, but the leisures of Manhattan life delivered as “gangsta rap.” The song has been heralded as “poking fun” or parodying rap music. Parody is more than a humorous rendering of a subject. Seymour Chatman, an American film and literary critic, has defined parody as a form of word play that “imitates an original by substituting as little as possible” (28). He identifies the importance of parody by its ability to imitate the original work’s style while using it as a “vehicle for baser, more vulgar, or other inappropriate content” (30).\n\nApplying the term “inappropriate” to “Lazy Sunday” seems unsuitable. “Inappropriate” degrades the new content in comparison to the original. While it is possible to view humorous shorts by the Lonely Island such as “Lazy Sunday” as parodies, the idea that their content is “inappropriate,” or of lesser value, than traditional rap songs is problematic. Instead, the shorts should be viewed as using rap for its traditional purpose to expose and critique the creator’s environment.\n\nRap is more than just a musical genre of spoken rhyme over a beat. In order to understand the musical and cultural importance of rap music, it is necessary to visualize its history. William Eric Perkins, editor of<em>Droppin’ Science: Critical Essays on Rap Music and Hip Hop Culture</em>, describes the evolution of rap in his essay, “The Rap Attack.” Some trace its development back to Africa, where oral communication and ritual chanting, such as call-and-response, were important and revered traditions. Others compare it to slave work songs, improvisational jazz and blues from the early 20th century, and poetry of the Black Arts Movement. All agree that the creation of rap is inextricably linked to African-American culture. It wasn’t until the late ’70s, as the technology for deejaying and mixing records developed, that rap exploded as a new genre with artists like Afrika Bambaataa and the Sugar Hill Gang. The constant beat created by those new technologies has remained one of the most important parts of the music.\n\nThe lyrics sung over the beat, like the lyrics of many other genres, have overcome the music to represent the work. Rap’s lyrics have a strong narrative element that lends itself to storytelling and oratory. Combined with its connection to African tradition and heritage, rap has emerged as the genre used by marginalized African-Americans to call attention to their status in society. There has always been a critical aspect of rap, whether in competitions between deejays who use their songs to highlight their accomplishments and their opponents’ shortcomings or simple boasting and displays of masculinity. Yet when combined with growing dissatisfaction with second-class citizenship and poor living standards, rap became a form of socio-economic expression. As the raps produced by these circumstances became successful, they were embraced by youth of all races, which caused a mainstream backlash. Today, it is hard to separate the cultural importance of rap from the musical one.\n\nTricia Rose, author of <em>Black Noise: Rap Music and Black Culture in Contemporary America</em>, broadly defines the genre as “a black cultural expression that prioritizes black voices from the margins of urban America” (2). Furthermore, she identifies rap’s primary thematic concerns as identity and location. Different varieties of rap address these concerns in different ways. “Gangsta” rap, based on experiences with gang violence, police run-ins, and general discontent in urban areas, especially Los Angeles, uses location to determine identity. The tone of these songs is aggressive and the words are charged. The songs attempt to bring critical attention to the inequality experienced by blacks in urban areas.\n\nAccording to Chatman, the tension between the original style (what is being copied) and new content (how it appears) determines the sense of inappropriateness necessary for a parody. Such a tension exists in “Lazy Sunday.” “Lazy Sunday” is the story of two white men, young and middle class, wasting their Sunday with a quest to see the newly released <em>Chronicles of Narnia</em>. The Lonely Island is describing a stereotypical American experience; however, they do so in an atypical style: gangsta rap. This contrast between the content and its description is the most striking part of the song and evident within the portrayal, themes, and word choice of the song.\n\nThe video is immediately misleading. It hides its content behind a stereotypical opening for a gangsta rap video: images of city streets, old buildings, and cars, typical views of the neighborhood. It isn’t until the camera cuts to Andy Samberg in a clean studio apartment that the video, and the audience’s perception of it, veers from a traditional path and becomes a farce. Yet the song continues to keep its focus on the neighborhood with references to notable destinations, such as Magnolia Bakery, and scenes walking down the street and in an abandoned park. This matches one of the primary themes of gangsta rap previously defined: location. Tricia Rose explains:\n\nNothing is more central to rap’s music video narrative than situating the rapper in his or her milieu and among one’s crew or posse. Unlike heavy metal music videos, for example, which often use dramatic live concert footage and the concert stage as the core location, rap music videos are set on buses, subways, in abandoned buildings, and almost always in black urban inner-city locations (10).\n\nThis focus on location in turn emphasizes rap’s other thematic concern, identity, as the songs are often ways to validate the home of the rapper: “Rappers’ emphasis on posses and neighborhoods has brought the ghetto back into the public consciousness. It satisfies poor young black people’s profound need to have their territories acknowledged, recognized, and celebrated” (11).  The Lonely Island is doing the same thing; they are situating themselves in their neighborhood in order to acknowledge and celebrate it. Why, then, is “Lazy Sunday” considered a parody and not a rap song?\n\nThe nuances of parody should be considered. Chatman refines his definition of parody to explain that stylistic parody depends on the audience’s familiarity with both the original author’s style and new subject matter’s inappropriateness. “The audience must not only recognize the original, but sense that the style is being used to express a content which the targeted author could or would not contemplate,” Chatman explains (36-7). A comparison between the notable gangsta rap group N.W.A. and the Lonely Island illuminates this tension. N.W.A., comprised of MCs Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, Ice Cube, MC Ren, and Ice-T, was one of the most controversial gangsta rap groups as well as one of the groups that gave the genre its direction.  Drawing from their experiences in Compton, a city in South Los Angeles County, N.W.A. brutally described the injustices of their community, especially those caused by the police. Ahmir “?uestlove” Thompson writes for <em>Rolling Stone’s</em> series “The Immortals: The 100 Greatest Artists of all Time”: “Even if you’ve never lived through all the gangbanging and police harassment they were talking about, you could tell there was truth there.”\n\nWhile N.W.A. clearly draws upon their neighborhood for inspiration and setting, their work transcends the specific location to rage out against the system at large. In their song, “F*** the Police,” they imitate a court trial of “N.W.A. versus the police department.” With guns going off in the background, Ice Cube sings, “Just cuz I’m from the CPT, punk police are afraid of me.” CPT, an abbreviation for Compton, becomes a charged word; it assumes that the listener will be familiar with its place and its story. In another song, “Straight Outta Compton,” the rappers pass the narrative of the song with a call-and-response: the call “Tell ’em where you from!” is answered with the line, “Straight outta Compton!” The video is more explicit in its commentary with its images of cops strapping on guns while looking at maps of Compton paired with the rappers sitting around burning trashcans and running from the police. Their work created the infamous image of Compton, which is now synonymous with gang-related crime and police violence.\n\nThe Upper West Side is the polar opposite of Compton. Yet the Lonely Island uses its reputation in the same way rappers now use Compton: to acknowledge a neighborhood, to establish identity, and to evoke an image. They exhibit their own street knowledge by knowing where to purchase the best cupcakes, “No doubt that bakery’s got all da bomb frostins,” and sneaking their own food into the movie theater, “The theater’s over-priced./You’ve got the backpack?/Gonna pack it up nice.” They recall aspects of New York City that are universally known, such as Magnolia and “Friends.” The images their “streets” invoke and the way they portray themselves are trivial in comparison to Compton and the attitudes of N.W.A.’s members. Samberg and Parnell need a search engine to find their way to the movie theater, and then end up in the back seat of a taxicab. While they may act tough by having a “snack attack” and sneaking food into a theater, they also consider the risks: “don’t want security to get suspicious.” Eazy-E, on the other hand, flaunts his actually toughness in “Straight Outta Compton”: “I see a motherf***** cop, I don’t dodge him.”  Finally, the gun shots heard in the background as the duo eats their cupcakes adds the coup de grâce. The probability of hearing guns shots on the Upper West Side is next to none. The Lonely Island is trying to transform their neighborhood into a “‘hood,” but is only making themselves seem like “posers.”\nWhile the Lonely Island convincingly copies the musical style of gangsta rap, their word choice and figures of speech accentuate the inappropriateness of their new content. Describing frosting as “da bomb” or the directions to the theater as the “dopest route” may be appropriate speech in rap, but when applied to locations in the stereotypical “intellectual” neighborhood of the Upper West Side, it comes out ridiculous. Even more ridiculous are the references the pair makes. They constantly refer to classic chick-flicks, “I love those cupcakes more than McAdams loves Gosling,” and they use the line “Girl actin’ like she never see a $10 before/ It’s all about the Hamiltons, baby.” This is a clear reference to the slang term for hundred dollar bills, “Benjamins.” Songs like Puff Daddy’s “It’s All About the Benjamins” focus solely on spending money, with lines like “I’m only here/For that green paper with the eagle.” Parnell and Samberg take these references to money even further though, with an easy-to-miss historical reference: “You can call us Aaron Burr/From the way we’re droppin’ Hamiltons.”  “Gangstas” quoting American history hardly seems appropriate and yet for once the duo does something that isn’t out of place for their neighborhood.\n\nThrough these dedications to the original form and incongruities consistent with their personal identities and backgrounds, the Lonely Island creates a humorous song that could be considered a parody. However, that interpretation is complicated by Chatman’s inclusion of another component of parody: a parody must “utilize the original writer’s diction and style, but follow a train of thought precisely along the lines that he would have pursued from the given premise” (36). It is hard to imagine a group like N.W.A. singing about a lazy Sunday spent in bed followed by neighborhood shenanigans. The comfortable bourgeois lifestyle that allows for a Sunday spent in such a manner is not one that typically can be found in the ’hood or ghetto. In fact, the forced aggressive tone of “Lazy Sunday” violates one of the central attractions of rap for youth, especially middle-class white youth: authenticity. Perkins writes about the appeal of gangsta rap:\n“In an age of mass overconsumption and media hype, gangsta rap no doubt represents a religion and ideology of authenticity . . . These abstract slogans of ‘bein’ and stayin’ real’ summon up romantic notions of ghetto authenticity . . . Hip hop speaks to youth’s desire for identity, for a sense of self-definition and purpose, no matter how lawless or pointless” (20).\n\nPerhaps this is what attracted Andy Samberg and his fellow Lonely Island members to rap in the first place. In an interview conducted with Jason Gay from <em>Rolling Stone</em> for the release of their album, Samberg speaks to his youth in California where he was surrounded by “standard Bay Area hippie shit” (Gay). As their interest grew, music and musical creation became their dream: “Growing up, we never talked about ‘We should all work at Saturday Night Live!’ We were like, ‘Someday, we should make an album. That would be awesome.’” Jonathan Lethem describes this conversion through imitation as typical in his essay “The Ecstasy of Influence”: “Most artists are brought to their vocation when their own nascent gifts are awakened by the work of a master. That is to say, most artists are converted to art by art itself. Finding one’s voice isn’t just an emptying and purifying oneself of the words of others but an adopting and embracing of filiations, communities, and discourses” (3).\n\nChatman would have to agree because he sees parody as “at once ridicule and <em>homage</em>” (33). The Lonely Island’s respect for the art seems genuine; the <em>New York Times</em> hails another Lonely Island song, “Natalie Raps,” which is a blatant copy of Eazy-E’s song “No More ?’s,” by saying, “It isn’t parody; it is a love letter” (Caramancia). Yet the group blatantly ignores the authentic aspect of the genre, and in doing so, questions the authenticity of the original songs. When Akiva Shaffer was asked why they created an album, he answered “Suffice it to say, the streets wanted it,” referring to the neighborhood fascination and validation of much of gangsta rap. However, Samberg counters with the question, “Are you talking about the British rapper guy The Streets?” (Gay). Clearly, nothing is serious for the trio, which makes their songs funny, but hard to imagine as “authentic” parodies.\n\nPerhaps the answer lies in the idea that the Lonely Island isn’t actually making a parody, but a new form of rap. Rap may have begun as a way to bring the marginalization of black society to public attention, but with “Lazy Sunday,” the Lonely Island is reversing the flow, bringing public attention to the sterility of what is considered mainstream. They are able to accomplish this through “enframing,” philosopher Martin Heidegger’s idea, which encourages people to see the objects in their world “only in terms of how they can serve [them] or be used by [them]” (Lethem, 4). This is not foreign to traditional rap’s creation, as rap is a musical genre based on appropriations of other genres for the purpose of meeting the rapper’s needs. Parody does this, but in order to comment on the original form, not the new content. The Lonely Island combines the two to serve their own purpose that could be construed as a way to safely comment on their own culture while remaining safely behind the humor of the surface-level parody.\n\nEnframing does not apply just to art; it is a part of human nature. In many ways the diffusion of rap and hip hop into all facets of mainstream culture can be attributed to this phenomenon. “White youth are not simply consuming pop culture messages wholesale, any more than Black kids are,” writes Bakari Kitwana, a former executive editor of The Source, one of the first publications devoted to rap music, and author of Why White Kids Like Hip-Hop.  “Most hip-hop kids … are taking from popular culture what they find useful, fashioning it to local needs, claiming it as their own and in the process placing their own stamp on it” (3). “Lazy Sunday” may appear to be a parody in its imitation of rap; however, it is the lifestyle, not the method of expressing it, that is the parody. It is the gangsta bravado that is the inappropriate content, not the song describing it. The Lonely Island is not criticizing the embrace of rap by white audiences. Instead, their depiction seems to be more critical of the adoption of a false behavior due to the sterility of mainstream society.\n\nBy sticking too closely to the form of parody, is the Lonely Island at risk of completely hiding their message? Not according to rap, where parody can be worked into the genre and remain a valid component of that genre. 2 Live Crew, a group of “booty rappers” (rap focused on sex and eroticism), spawned controversy in the ’90s for both their explicit content and appropriation. They were sued for copyright violation for their parody of Roy Orbison’s 1964 hit, “Oh, Pretty Woman.” While a lower court found the group guilty, the Supreme Court found the song to be protected as an original parody under the doctrine of “fair use.” Justice David Souter explained that the song provided “social benefit … as a comment on the naiveté of the original of an earlier day, as a rejection of its sentiment that ignores the ugliness of street life and the debasement that it signifies” (Chatman, 27). Even outside of their parody, the “meaning hiding beneath the surface of the obvious meaning of the lyrics” in 2 Live Crew’s work has been considered beneficial social commentary. In a lawsuit over obscenity and pornography, witness Professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. concluded, “Well they represent the stereotype over and over again, in such a graphic way, namely to exploit it. You can have no reaction but to bust out laughing. You realize how ridiculous this all is” (Perkins, 25). While it is unlikely that 2 Live Crew originally wrote their works to be funny, or even to exploit stereotypes in a critical way, it is clear that their work is able to provide criticism, parody, and authenticity, thus successfully being rap while remaining humorous.\n\n“I think the goal of most comedy, just like most movies or television, is an escape from the mundane stuff in our life, and I’ve always found it worthwhile to make something completely stupid just to prove that you can,” said Andy Samberg in an online interview with <em>Esquire</em> about his work. His words highlight the dualism in his comedy—humor and criticism combined. When viewed within that context and not as parody, “Lazy Sunday” can offer the viewer more than a prescription for an amusing weekend agenda. It can offer a way to laugh at yourself, no matter your race, class, or musical tastes.

Nevertheless, tabloids may be worth a closer look. In <em>Men In Black</em>, Tommy Lee Jones, Agent K, and Will Smith, Agent J, scour the tabloids for reports of extra-terrestrial activity, viewing these absurdities as “the best investigative journalism on the planet” (Men In Black). The American government and society in the film see supermarket tabloids as the purest form of unencumbered truth, where the most absurd conspiracies are blatant fact and the skeptics are merely in denial. This comic portrayal of a society with radically different values of journalistic validity hints at a presence of truth in tabloid journalism that is often brusquely dismissed. Though we are all aware of the lies and inventions presented in such tabloids as <em>The Weekly World News</em>, perhaps it is possible to uncover an element of truthful social commentary beneath the surface of their flagrant fabrications. By looking at the tabloids’ commentary on American politics and power, we can discern an allegory for current American values and concerns: one which provides a unique forum for contemporary societal frustrations.\r\n\r\nSince its birth as a refuge to individuals driven from their homelands by religious persecution, America has been a nation rich with symbolism of new beginnings and allegoric representations of important historic events. Defining allegory as the expression of truths or generalizations about human existence by means of symbolic fictional figures and actions, one can begin to recognize many such representations throughout American History. The way Americans interpret their own social, political, and economic condition through cultural allegory has evolved and developed from the idealism of colonial America to the cynicism of the modern era.\r\n\r\nDeborah L. Madson’s<em> Allegory in America </em>provides a fluid explanation of American allegory as it has evolved from colonialism to the postmodernist era, while also chronicling the transformation of American ideals and values. In the early stages of colonial settlement, Americans created allegories to represent the trials and hardship with which they were repeatedly assailed. Stemming from the idea of religion as the basis of the migration from Europe to the New World, the allegories adopted were generally Biblical (Madsen, 2). In particular, colonists related their experience to that of the “redeemed people [led by Moses] out of bondage in Egypt into the freedom of the Promised Land” (Madsen, 2). The colonists viewed their mission to develop “a citie upon a hill” as a religious calling to set an example for other nations of redemption and second chances (Madsen, 2). Thus, just as Moses led the persecuted Jews from Egypt, America became the new ‘Promised Land’, one of intense religious loyalty and opportunity. The Biblical allegory allowed colonists to explain the trials and challenges such as famine, Indian attack, and disease which they were experiencing. Colonists could justify their suffering as symbolic of God’s concern for their spiritual welfare, “a means of warning them of the dangers of complacency” (Madsen, 2). Consequently, the biblical allegory served to sanction colonial actions by reassuring colonists of the righteousness of their choices.\r\n\r\nInversely, the same allegory could be used as a rebellion against these very rationalizations. While the persecuted Jews were escaping unjust treatment from the Egyptians, the colonists were instilling similar abuses on the natives of the new land. Here, the reading of the allegory serves as a critique of the colonists for the hypocrisy of manipulating such an allegory to justify their own oppressive actions. The influence of the Exodus story on New World America, Madsen suggests, represents the tendency of allegories to propagate during times of cultural crisis as a means of encouraging continued strength. Yet, the many facets and elements of each allegorical tale lend it a flexibility, allowing it to represent not only the orthodox vision, in this case of America as the land of opportunity, but also “a voice to those who dissent from this vision, who use allegory only to reject what it has come to stand for” (Madsen, 5). Therefore, we see both the origination of allegorical tradition in American society as well as its propensity to create a paradox, a means of questioning its own values.\r\n\r\nA cultural crisis of today, from which an allegory might stem, lies in the lack of political stability stemming from conflicting opinions concerning presidential legitimacy and capability. Going into the Election of 2000, the country was starkly divided between support for the Democratic candidate, Al Gore, and the Republican candidate, George W. Bush. In fact, the election was so closely divided that President Bush was set into office without the backing of the popular vote, which made for one of the “messiest postelection [periods] in American history” (Cook, 652). An ABC News/ Washington Post Survey of 1,050 adults taken in late February, 2001 showed Bush’s popularity, 55% approval, to be the “lowest job-approval rating of any newly elected President in the past 50 years” (Cook, 652). Throughout Bush’s presidency, the country has seen a continuous seesaw of rising and falling support for the President’s actions.\r\n\r\nIn fact, a poll taken just prior to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, found President Bush’s approval rating had dipped to a low 51%, only to sky rocket after the attacks to an impressive 90%, before sinking once again to 57% by early March of the following year (Cook, 2507). Earlier this year, Richard Benedetto, a journalist for USA Today, found the President’s “score for honesty and trustworthiness [to be] at the lowest point of his presidency” (Benedetto, A. 07). Explanations for Bush’s rising and falling popularity inevitably stem from an immense polarity within the country, “the country remains evenly split, 50-50, between the two major parties” (Cook, 2507). A country so divided lends itself to allegorization, though not in such a conventional form as those of colonial times.\r\n\r\nRather, the specific allegory adopted during each moment of cultural crisis appears to reflect the popular culture and societal values of the given period. Just as the colonists of the New World created a Biblical allegory to the richness of their religious piety, we might expect to find our contemporary allegory veiled under the cover of American consumerism and materialism. In his commentary on the declining value of pure education in the university culture, Mark Edmundson notes that “university culture like American culture writ large is…ever more devoted to consumption and entertainment” (Edmundson, 2). Even Politics has become a matter of entertainment, as one might see in such politically-oriented talk shows as "Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher" and "The Daily Show with Jon Stewart." With immense efforts to draw voter attention and interest through entertaining and catchy campaigns, we have become “a country learning about one party’s potential nominees in a way that suggests it might be easier to learn about their platform had they taken out ads in <em>Daily Variety</em>” (Goodman, D.1). Goodman, a journalist for <em>The San Francisco Chronicle</em>, comments that the upcoming election is so entertainment-oriented that it appears to be “ignoring the real information and concentrating on poll results and personal high jinks” (Goodman, D.1). American society today depends on entertainment in all areas of knowledge acquisition, from university education to information about political campaigns. In this age of entertainment, it is no wonder that we might begin to discover our allegories of American political ideology in something as common and consumer-based as a supermarket tabloid.\r\n\r\nSupermarket tabloids overflow with entertainment, appearing to focus much more on amusing their readers then on passing on any important information. William Randolph Hearst, one of the pioneers of tabloid journalism, espoused a journalistic philosophy of “90% entertainment, 10% information - and the information without boring you” (Sloan, 25). Yet, considering the absent need for intellectualism in such reporting, tabloid journalists are not nearly as self-effacing and uneducated as one might expect. In order to improve the quality of their product in the early 1970s, tabloid publishers began to draw in the most esteemed journalists from respectable newspapers ranging from the<em> Los Angeles Times</em> to the <em>Fort Worth Press</em>. They accomplished this by promising a “fat pay raise” (Sloan, 14) which resulted in the <em>Enquirer</em> salaries being “the highest paid by any paper or magazine in the country” (Sloan, 14). Thus, with such well-regarded minds concocting stories, these tabloids should not be dismissed so quickly as being entirely without merit. One might wonder, with such respectable writers, whether tabloids have a more formative effect on their audience than we might previously have assumed.\r\n\r\nThe majority of tabloid readers are between the ages of 20 and 49, the voting public, creating a very effective audience for political commentary (“Trends in Newspaper Readership”). While expecting all of these readers to recognize the political commentary concealed in the tales woven by tabloid journalists, the reactions of readers to these stories certainly vary. The flexibility of tabloid journalism lies in its ability to be read in one of two ways: as serious, though fantastical, journalism, or as ridiculously absurd comedy. Those who choose to read tabloids in the former manner take its stories at face value, rarely questioning the truth of the news as reported. Those who employ the latter method might use tabloids as a lens to ridicule modern society. This dual function lends tabloid journalism the ability to create an effective modern allegory. Tabloids possess a subversive nature, a painstakingly hidden truth which, when discovered, can open the eyes of the reader to the hypocrisies of their own society.\r\n\r\nBetween the considerable experience and ability of tabloid journalists and the unknowingly susceptible audience, one can imagine that these journalists might be tempted to slip some political commentary into their stories. In fact, tabloid journalists of the 1970s, became “the first among their profession since World War II – at least in this country – to take a questioning, aggressive, often adversarial approach to government and other major forces that control our society” (Sloan, 15). Thus, thirty years ago, tabloid staff set a precedent of intelligent political commentary that appears to remain, though painstakingly hidden, even in the most sensationalized and unrealistic tabloids of today.\r\n\r\nThe search for political commentary in <em>The Weekly World News</em>, yields a fruitful article,“2-Headed Man for President – And Vice President,” which appears to be merely a comical fabrication, yet, with further scrutiny, serves as an allegory of current American political division. The article discusses the background and political platform of a fictional two-headed character, Peter Paul Prentice (One head being Peter, the other Paul), running for the presidency and vice presidency as an independent. By setting up the candidate as an independent, the journalist, Annie Van Horne, creates a foundation for a critical commentary on both democratic and republican ideals.\r\n\r\nThe article presents a valid political platform with qualities typical of the two prominently conflicting parties, the republicans and the democrats. Van Horne describes such espoused policies as balancing the budget and increasing military spending which, according to analysts, are typical of the republican party (Fineman, 38). She also describes what many call characteristically democratic policies, such as Medicare drug benefits to senior citizens and legalization of purchasing pharmaceuticals overseas (Alter, 22). We see further symbolism of the conflict between republicans and democrats in Prentice’s place of birth: Sarasota, Florida, one of the many counties in Florida which experienced a re-count after the confused elections of 2000. Thus, Van Horne sets the candidate up as an embodiment of both parties, thereby allowing us to see his two-headedness as a symbol of the conflict between the right and the left.\r\n\r\nYet, Peter Paul Prentice is not only referred to as “two-headed,” he is also termed “two-faced” (Van Horne, 6), indicating an element of hypocrisy among any single candidate or political party. This idea of hypocrisy serves as a common means of ammunition against one’s opponent. In the current election, republicans attack John Kerry for his hypocritical acceptance of campaign contributions from companies which he had previously condemned for their practice of sending their operations over seas to avoid U.S. taxes (Human Events, 6).\r\n\r\nSimilarly, in the elections of 2000, Bush was criticized for his hypocrisy when he promised to change the accusatory tone of modern presidential campaigns and then went on to cast “aspersions of Gore’s mistakes and exaggerations” (Safire, B.11). The<em> Weekly World News</em>’ Van Horne not only critiques the current political system through a disguised reference to hypocrisy, she also bluntly assails the vanity of the current president, professing that Peter Paul Prentice would expand education with the money that President Bush would have used for “pork barrel programs” such as “adding [his] bust to Mount Rushmore” (Van Horne, 6). Thus, through the use of fantastical characters and a fictional scenario, the<em> Weekly World News</em> creates an allegory which serves as a critique of the dishonesty, self-interest, and duality of the current political system.\r\n\r\nIn another addition of the <em>Weekly World News</em>, correspondent Miguel Figueora writes “Oil Discovered in Cuba--U.S. Troops Poised to Liberate Island Nation,” an article which subtly critiques the faults of the current presidency and the conservative ideology. The article discusses a fictional discovery of oil off the cost of Cuba, a discovery that, Figueora purports, will lead America to invade Cuba and overthrow Fidel Castro. The supposed oil in Cuba mirrors the situation that Bush faced in Iraq, thus serving as an allegory of the Iraq War. By touching on the motivations for which Bush was accused of going to war with Iraq, the article mocks American self-centeredness.\r\n\r\nFigueora comments on the idea of oil as motivation when he remarks, “it’s the access to millions of gallons of ‘black gold’ that really excites the White House” (Figueora, 11), as well as on the perception that successful grandiose action will ensure re-election-- “this time the vote in Florida won’t be close, trust me” (Figueora, 11). Figueora bluntly discusses the Bush’s hypothetical motivation for invading Cuba as he explains that Americans have located the oil but now need to “[overthrow] Fidel so we can go get it” (Figueora, 11). The directness of such an assertion reflects a common critique, espoused by George Soros, of America’s self-serving motivation for war with Iraq.\r\n\r\nIn <em>The Bubble of American Supremacy</em>, Soros discusses Bush’s possible reasons for initiating war on Iraq and focuses on America’s limited resources of oil saying, “to lift the [oil] embargo with Saddam Hussein still in power might have made him too dangerous; therefore he had to be removed from power” (Soros, 53). To emphasize this idea of American self-interest, Figueora makes allusion to a past attempt to overthrow Castro in the Bay of Pigs Invasion. That “ill-fated attack” (Figueora, 11) was only “half-hearted” says Figueora, but in the current attack, he counters, we’re going to “kick butt and take over” (Figueora, 11). Figueora creates an implied link between the half-heartedness of the previous attempt and its ultimate failure. He elaborates that the attack will be “nothing like” that of 1961, implying not only dissimilar effects but also different incentives. While the Bay of Pigs Invasion was spurred by a hatred of communism, the current attack is motivated by personal gain, lower gas prices, and “a big political payoff” (Figueora, 11) for the President. In this way, Figueora broaches the topic of American Supremacy, the concern that America considers only its own interests. Out of these subtleties and allusions as well as blatant exaggerations, Figueora fashions an allegorical critique of American political action, a fictional story with real implications.\r\n\r\nYet, not only the content of Figueora’s article serves as an allegory of the War in Iraq, but also the style in which he creates his argument. By quoting only the President himself and “unnamed” White House officials, Figueora approaches the article through the perspective of the party now in power, the conservatives. In a way, this perspective allows him to more effectively critique the conservative ideology. Endowing himself with the power to exaggerate the conservative opinions, he creates a subversive parody of the current government.\r\n\r\nIn his argument in favor of invading Cuba, Figueora mimics the rhetorical techniques employed by George W. Bush during his rationalization of initiating war in Iraq. In a speech Bush made to the National Press Conference on March 6, 2003, the President attempted to kindle American patriotism by tying his desire to commence war in Iraq to the memory of the terrorist attacks of September 11th. Despite the fact that the government found “no proven ties” (Soros, 41) between Saddam Hussein and the Al Qaeda terrorists, Bush continually made comments setting the two parties as parallel threats. In one blunt attempt to draw an analogy between the terrorist threat from Iraq and Al Qaeda, Bush avowed that “the attacks of September 11th, 2001 showed what the enemies of America did with four airplanes. We will not wait to see what terrorists or terrorist states could do with weapons of mass destruction” (Bush).\r\n\r\nIn the same manner, Figueora juxtaposes references to Saddam Hussein in the plans to overthrow Fidel Castro saying, “Cuban dictator Fidel Castro could soon be out of power and in jail – just like Saddam Hussein” (Figueora, 11). Figueora creates an exaggerated parallelism even more evidently contrived then that of the President in order to cast a light of enmity on Castro, just as Bush had cast that same light on Hussein. The lack of subtlety in Figueora’s juxtapositions appears to serve as a direct parody of Bush’s rationalization of war. The style in which Figueora composes his article creates a further allegory in itself of the manipulated rhetoric used by President Bush to gather support for a war with Iraq.\r\n\r\nThrough the creation of fictional scenarios and the use of occasionally fictional, often real political figures, <em>The Weekly World News</em> engineers a series of political allegories which mirror both the divisive nature of our political system and the failures and inconsistencies of American political action. These allegories, offer readers not only a sensationalized and fantasized version of modern American current events, but also a glimpse of the uncertainty and concern that many Americans feel when they learn of these proceedings. The fantastical imagery and symbolism of far-fetched supermarket tabloids provide stories of American politics and power that few other forms of media are at liberty to tell. By taking such a subversive approach, disguising political critique as entertainment, tabloid journalists catch their readers unaware. They force even the unwilling reader to recognize some level of hypocrisy whether only in the allegory or itself, or in the current events which it represents. These supermarket tabloids provide a forum to disagree with current political policies without doing so directly. They create an allegory which, when read literally, merely weaves a tale similar to the unfolding of events in our contemporary society. Yet, when recognized for their hypocrisy, these tales open up a world for the critiquing; they create a forum for discreetly recognizing the flaws of one’s government without betraying one’s own political inclinations.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'Tabloid Absurdity: Allegories of a Contemporary American Political Crisis by Monique Wolkoff', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'tabloid-absurdity-allegories-of-a-contemporary-american-political-crisis-by-monique-wolkoff', '', '', '2012-03-23 15:52:24', '2012-03-23 15:52:24', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=303', 0, 'essay', '', 0),

(304, 5, '2011-12-19 08:36:06', '2011-12-19 08:36:06', '<blockquote>It was my place, at that time in space, and the jet was mine for those moments. Though it was a place where I could quickly die, the cockpit was a place where I truly lived.\r\n–Brian Shul, ''Sled Driver; Flying The World''s Fastest Jet,'' 1992.</blockquote>\r\nIn the early stages of aviation technology, the duration of WWI and the decade to follow, the United States Army Air Service played but a minor role in both America’s military strategy and budget; aircraft were severely overshadowed by the mighty battleship, the “backbone of the [naval] fleet and the bulwark of the nation’s sea defense” (CR 8625). But several factors shifted the country’s perspective of the warplane into a more appealing and popular light: Brig. General Billy Mitchell’s compelling arguments; the aerial bombing tests of 1921; and the successful sinking of the German battleship SMS Ostfriesland.\r\n\r\nMitchell primarily anchored the success of his experiments to the warplane’s efficiency. “There are no conditions in which seacraft can operate efficiently in which aircraft cannot operate efficiently,” Mitchell claimed, firmly grounding his argument for a change in military spending in logic and reasoning; “Air forces… can find and destroy all classes of seacraft” (U.S. 1828-1829). And when asked if he could prove his position, he replied, “Give us the warships to attack and come out and watch it” (Davis 71).\r\n\r\nThe emphasis of efficiency within Mitchell’s campaign, however, is quite perplexing, for while the overwhelming factor in the military’s approval of aerial warfare was the warplane’s efficiency, th ere was a much more immediate concern surrounding early aviation. In the early twenties, only a few days ever went by without the report of yet another warplane crash, another grotesque disaster in the skies. June 1921 alone yielded eight horrid tragedies, from “Lightning Bolt Felled Big Plane” to “Planes Crash in Air and Pilots Go to Death;” even movie star Jimmie Callahan’s fingers were cut off by a propeller in the process of filming a stunt (Film 10). Yet less than a month later, the military seemed ready to embrace the menacing warplane! Perhaps even more astounding was the public’s stance. Mitchell’s aerial tests sought the nation’s approval as well, and somehow his arguments compelled the press to endorse the warplane despite all the nightmarish articles they constantly published about the dangers and insecurities of aviation. Where did this appeal come from? What could possibly influence the nation to act so myopically, to embrace unflinchingly such a deadly machine?\r\n\r\nBy identifying the warplane as a “vehicle of romance,” H. Bruce Franklin argues that the warplane’s appeal stemmed from something very contrary to efficiency (55). Franklin observes the vast appeal of the plane in the “warplane models assembled by millions of boys and young men during World War II, the thousands of warplane magazines filled with glossy photographs that some find as stimulating as those in men’s magazines,” and even the movie Strategic Air Command, “in which Jimmy Stewart’s response to his first sight of a B-47 nuclear bomber is, ‘She’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen in my life’” (Franklin 54). It is this evidence, as well, that suggests that the romance generated is only a product of warplanes and not ordinary planes. Ordinary planes are useful and efficient, but load an automatic gun and a two-ton bomb aboard and the vehicle takes on a whole new persona. However, planes had already been used as bombers as early as 1915, in the midst of World War I. Mitchell wasn’t even the first to romanticize the warplane: Briton Drops Bombs at Zeebrugge Despite Heavy GermanFire Thursday night, an English warplane hovered over Zeebrugge, and, defying the concentrated fire, made a sudden dive to within 300 feet… The airman coolly dropped his bombs at short range on the submarine… There was a terrific explosion, and the submarine was sunk. The aviator got away safely (“Aviator” 1). The title suggests struggle and conflict, but the report itself lends the aviator a cool and casual air. Within this short wire, we can already see the romanticizing of both the warplane and its suave maverick cowboy-like pilot. Through his examination of various military and media transcripts, Harry H. Ransom concludes that the test bombings of 1921 were “the most significant events of the period, even more important than the total experiences of the Air Service in the [first] World War,” like the one above (27). But how could simulations carry a stronger effect than a real wartime skirmish?\r\n\r\nBecause all the bombings of 1915 were overseas, we salvaged but a few stories and no pictures; Mitchell recognized that he could not romanticize the warplane nearly as effectively through imaginative words as he could through actual images. Mitchell’s plan was far more complex than a simple test of the aircraft’s capability; aside from the designing of the largest bombs ever made and new instruments to calculate the trajectory of his new weapons, Mitchell also hired George Goddard, a young and innovative photographer, to handle public relations. “I want newsreels of those sinking ships in every theater in the country, just as soon as we can get them there,” Mitchell ordered (Davis 79). Soon Goddard’s films began screening nationwide, and the country was beginning to picture the warplane as never before.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_102" align="alignright" width="159" caption="U.S. AIR FORCE, 1921"]<img class="size-full wp-image-102 " title="U.S. AIR FORCE, 1921" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/sinkingship.jpg" alt="U.S. AIR FORCE, 1921" width="159" height="565" />[/caption]\r\n\r\nMitchell invited several distinguished international delegates to witness the sinking of the Ostfriesland from a naval ship stationed nearby, the Henderson, but his greatest concern was the flock of reporters present for the event (Davis 101). Members from all the major papers, including representatives from England, Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, and Brazil, were on hand to observe and report the results. It is through the eyes of these observers and their firsthand reports that we can get a taste of the warplane’s true character.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, the reporters invariably refer to the Ostfriesland, like all ships of its time, as female; they describe how the two-thousand pound bombs “rupture her plates and bulkheads” (Hicks 36), “open her seams and make a sinking bulk of her” (Sinking 5). The personification of the battleship echoes a strong familiarity with her, a century-long history. In striking contrast, these journalists never attribute a gender to the plane; it was a mysterious stranger whose audience had not yet established a familiarity with it. This was not a mere test run but the dramatic introduction of a new character into the complex storyline that was naval warfare.\r\n\r\nMitchell actually found his two-thousand pound bombs to be more useful when they did not directly hit his target but rather land nearby; the detonation, magnified by the pressure underwater, could rip the ship’s hull apart. But the “hammer effect,” as it came to be known, was not only an efficient and useful strategy; it also left a powerful impression upon the reporters present. The underwater detonation sent a fierce shockwave through the water, causing the Henderson and its crew to shake violently and rumble (Davis 107). The terrifying effects of the ton-heavy bombs suddenly transformed the warplane from a stranger–an unfamiliar piece of machinery –into something much more awesome. The roles had been reversed; now the skies were a location of control, and the ground seemed not so safe. The association and familiarity the battleship carried also helped to intensify the drama and romanticism of the moment. While the sinking of the Ostfriesland undoubtedly proved the efficiency of the warplane ­ the ship sunk rather quickly, in under eight minutes ­ what caught its audience’s eyes was the manner in which she went down. The Ostfriesland “…in the few moments of the final plunge assumed a perpendicular position… Turning completely over, the vessel sank bottom up, the keel being the part of the ship last seen” (Hicks 36). Not much unlike another practice target, U.S. Air Force, 1921 the Frankfurt, which “was lifted bodily several feet by the blast and at once began to settle forward… [and] as she went down, her rudders and propeller rose clearly out of the water” (Hicks 36), there was an element of grace to the Ostfriesland’s ­ and any warship’s ­ destruction. It clutched from the forceful blow delivered by the plane and rolled over on its side. And just before it permanently went down, it stood itself upright in the air. One last breath, one final gasp of air, and then it slowly withered to its subterranean burial ground. The Ostfriesland didn’t just sink; it died dramatically. The bomb’s terrifying shockwaves, the battleship’s familiarity, and the Ostfriesland’s graceful burial all leant a certain drama to the spectacle and all contributed to its romanticism, but Franklin argues that they accomplished even more. By contrasting the aerial bombings to Herman Melville’s “Utalitarian View of the Monitor’s Flight,” the depiction of technology as “plain mechanic power,” Franklin suggests that these bombings not only glorified the warplane but also gave it life (Franklin 48, 54). The warplane, now infused with a soul, not only became easy to embrace, but even became easy to relate to on a personal level, as was perfectly demonstrated by Jimmy Stewart’s remarks. This personification, by no means an insignificant factor, tremendously swayed the public both to favor and trust the warplane and its aviary capabilities.\r\n\r\nOne is left to wonder, however, what kind of argument romanticism should provide for the approval of aerial combat. If the warplane truly were a danger to fly, wouldn’t our ability to relate to it like a person spur our caution and concerns and dissuade us from admiring its military capabilities? If we are truly weighing the existing dangers against our emotional investment, how can we come to pick and choose, to love the machine’s awesome and terrifying bombs and yet look away from all the imminent tragedy? Mitchell’s tests, however, did not only romantically recreate the warplane’s nature; they directly countered any previous images that may have been associated with it, like endless smoke and blazing fires from midair crashes, lightning bolts, and many other freakish disasters. On July 10th, 1921, a mere eleven days prior to Mitchell’s tests, a bombing plane spun out of control and crashed full force into Langin Field, a crowded auto field with thousands of people, killing 6 and injuring 50. The Washington Post and many other papers printed a very gruesome ­ and very real ­ photo of the ghastly wreck in the next day’s paper; thick black smoke poured from the melee, the scorching fires added to the hellishness of the scene. These images added a complication to Mitchell’s project. It would no longer suffice for Mitchell’s planes to functionally perform their task; somehow, Goddard’s films would have to not only avert the association between smoke, fire, and the warplane from people’s thoughts, but also negate that very association.\r\n\r\nPerhaps what made Goddard’s movies so effective and romantic was neither the birth of the plane nor the graceful death of the battleship. For many logical reasons the relative difficulty of hitting a floating target compared to a stationary land base, and the comparatively common presence of heavy gale winds and fog at sea ­ General Mitchell conducted his experiments on the water, but the ocean setting had an advantageous effect as well. By relying on the hammer effect to rip open the hulls of victim ships, the bombings that very next week negated the effects of the nightmarish scene at Langin Field, recreating the identity of the plane as a much quieter destructive force. Smoke was replaced with steam, fire with water. The battleship didn’t smolder; it quietly sank. Most importantly, the test left no mess behind; the surface of the water returned to its peaceful and calm state. On water, the plane didn’t just defeat the warship; it erased it from existence. On water, the plane didn’t just cause massive destruction; it also wiped it from our memories.\r\nThis disparity between the effects of aerial bombing on land and on sea actually played a clear role in the Navy’s decision how they would employ the use of warplanes. Captain William S. Pye, the Navy’s assistant director of their War Plans Division, argued that “if the people of the United States had seriously considered this question of international morality, they would reject the idea of strategic bombing,” thereby decreasing the need of warplanes (Ransom 28). Pye, in conclusion, felt comfortable only in using aircraft on the sea, where the civilian casualties would be reduced. However, the question here wasn’t over the efficiency of TNT as a destructive agent; all Pye debated was the proper method of delivery, by air or by sea (Goodrich 10). Perhaps the comfort Pye felt, the comfort Pye predicted Americans would feel, was the clean quiet and efficient death the warplane could administer with its mammoth, menacing, and yet relatively silent bombs. Without thick black smoke or traces of rubble, with a more graceful and romantic image to feed the nation, Mitchell had the perfect footage to deliver to its audience; the “questions of morality” had been masterfully offset.\r\nIt was not until 1964 that Stanley Kubrick’s cinematic satire Dr. Strangelove forced the world to consider this crime, humanity’s crime of unjustly falling in love with warfare. The movie was released at the height of the Cold War and blatantly parodied the international anxieties of pending doom, the fear that our “nuclear deterrents” could accidentally ­ and ironically ­ result in the thorough annihilation of life on Earth. But “what Kubrick’s Cold War satire showed was not men at the mercy of machines, but machines at the mercy of men,” the flawless deterrents being misused by a few flawed individuals (Ebert).\r\n\r\nThe paranoid and mentally unstable General Jack Ripper initiates a nuclear strike on the Soviet Union. In his state of paranoia, he assumes the “Commies” will try to capture and torture him for the nuclear strike recall codes; valiantly, though foolishly, Ripper commits suicide. U.S. President Merkin Muffley contacts the Soviet Premier to discuss the urgency of the matter and devise a strategy to bring down the dispatched B-52s, but the ‘serious’ phone call (“Dimitri, one of our generals, well, he went and did a silly thing… No, don’t say you’re more sorry, I’m capable of being as sorry as you”) reduces the social conflict of nuclear war to nothing more than a children’s quarrel. When the Russians complete the Doomsday Device, the ultimate nuclear deterrent incapable of being deactivated, the Premier neglects to inform the world, waiting for just the right moment to break the news; “You know how much the Premier likes surprises,” the Soviet ambassador reasons to the President. The message seems clear. Virtually every character in this film is portrayed as insane ­ though to different degrees ­ suggesting that the modern perspective of war is the product of a mental illness, one that began decades ­ if not centuries ­ ago and slowly, permanently, conditioned its way into the human mind.\r\n\r\nKubrick’s machines are more than just innocent bystanders. The Soviet Doomsday Device is treated like a real character of the movie; like the giant boards of flashing lights in the American War Room, it is capable of functioning entirely on its own. However, the Device is mistreated by mankind and forced to destroy the world. Similarly, when a soldier shoots a coke machine to take its coinage by force, the machine reacts by not only spitting out quarters but also a steady stream of cola right at its aggressor’s face. Kubrick’s audience is compelled to sympathize and rally around these mistreated machines, to love them despite all the trouble they ultimately cause.\r\n\r\nRomanticism, again, is the central tool used to create affection towards these machines. From the soothing introductory music accompanied by footage of a bomber squadron to the movie’s closing montage of mushroom clouds as Vera Lynn sings “We’ll Meet Again,” Kubrick’s choice of beautiful music helps to emphasize the beauty of his wartime footage. In “one of the most famous moments in modern film” (Ebert), Major “King” Kong, a B-52 pilot in uniform but a wild western cowboy at heart, is feverishly attempting to force open the jammed hatch underneath his plane to release the hydrogen bomb. Accidentally, he is dropped out of the plane along with the bomb as soon as the hatch is opened. Caught in the excitement of the moment, he begins to hoot and holler, waving his oversized cowboy hat in every direction, like a rugged cowboy riding a bucking bronco. Again, the romanticism is perfectly captured in Major Kong’s display, and the nuclear weapons directly responsible for nuking the Soviets, triggering the Doomsday Device, and rendering all life on Earth extinct, are seen as the misused tools of an overly malicious bombardier. Furthermore, Maj. Kong’s character is masterfully employed to offset any similarity his ride may have to Japan’s kamikaze warfare; the Japanese are remembered as evil and Kong, heroic.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_310" align="alignright" width="267" caption="Dr. Strangelove, 1964"]<img class="size-full wp-image-310" title="Dr. Strangelove, 1964" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/drstrange1.jpg" alt="Dr. Strangelove, 1964" width="267" height="232" />[/caption]\r\n\r\nHowever, Kubrik’s characters are much deeper than the superficial insanity they display. If the movie were meant to criticize the social and political atmosphere of its time for falling in love with warfare, then we would expect the dangerously Dr. Strangelove, 1964 malicious Major Kong to at least make his audience flinch, yet even in this movie’s darkest moment, as Major Kong unknowingly destroys the world, the audience can’t help but laugh at his cowboy-like antics. The characters are not remembered as villains, mass murderers, or future embodiments of Adolf Hitler (the title character, Dr Strangelove, constantly represses his mechanical arm from performing the Nazi salute). Instead, they are remembered as loveable ­ though hapless and ignorant ­ heroes.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the film argues that the only thing that could cause thorough annihilation is if the entire world were to go insane at exactly the same time, like the coincidence that Russian scientists build a Doomsday Device the very week an American general psychologically breaks down. In which case, we have little to fear. We can love Major Kong for his noble intentions, and we can laugh with the president and his loony generals as they fumblingly try to save the world, though they sometimes forget that the Communists aren’t the most immediate threat anymore (“Boy, I’ve got to get me one of those Doomsday Devices!”).\r\n\r\nDr. Strangelove is much deeper than a warning of the dangers of falling in love with war. Machines alone, Jackson Burgess concludes in his essay on Kubrick’s film, may be “beautiful, functional, and absolutely reliable, but mindless and heartless” (11). The American nuclear strike protocol and the Russian Doomsday Device function exactly as planned, and neither beauty nor efficiency necessarily translates into successful military strategy. The only thing that holds the reality of a nuclear holocaust at fair distance is “Man ­ sloppy, incompetent, unreliable, but full of hope and courage” (11). Machines, such as atomic bombs or warplanes, are dangerous when left to function on their own; but when partnered with a courageous and caring person, the weapon can assume a new and virtuous persona, much like John Wayne’s righteous pistols.\r\n\r\nPerhaps what transforms the most deadly war machines into “vehicles of romance” is not only the subjective beauty of aesthetic destruction, like the perfectly rounded mushroom clouds of the atomic bomb, but also the recognition of something potentially upright and just. Perhaps what makes these personified warplanes “vehicles” is not just their ability to transport two-thousand pound bombs to battleships or submarines, but rather to serve, as living soldiers do, as the efficient and practical manifestations of our most noble desires. So long as the warplane’s awesome power is not misused, but rather thoughtfully harnessed, it can truly embody and relate to Man’s most honorable aspirations on a very personal level, thus rendering the danger of disaster and midair malfunctions an ultimately cause worthy risk. Captain William Pye’s proposal was eventually rejected, and warplanes served a primary role on both sea and land in America’s triumph over Nazism, fascism, and the Axis regime in World War II.', 'Embracing the Warplane: Romanticism''s Role in the Rise of Air Power', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'embracing-the-warplane-romanticisms-role-in-the-rise-of-air-power', '', '', '2012-03-23 15:11:40', '2012-03-23 15:11:40', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=304', 0, 'essay', '', 0),

Though it was a place where I could quickly die, the cockpit was a place where I truly lived.\n–Brian Shul, ''Sled Driver; Flying The World''s Fastest Jet,'' 1992.</blockquote>\nIn the early stages of aviation technology, the duration of WWI and the decade to follow, the United States Army Air Service played but a minor role in both America’s military strategy and budget; aircraft were severely overshadowed by the mighty battleship, the “backbone of the [naval] fleet and the bulwark of the nation’s sea defense” (CR 8625). But several factors shifted the country’s perspective of the warplane into a more appealing and popular light: Brig. General Billy Mitchell’s compelling arguments; the aerial bombing tests of 1921; and the successful sinking of the German battleship SMS Ostfriesland.\n\nMitchell primarily anchored the success of his experiments to the warplane’s efficiency. “There are no conditions in which seacraft can operate efficiently in which aircraft cannot operate efficiently,” Mitchell claimed, firmly grounding his argument for a change in military spending in logic and reasoning; “Air forces… can find and destroy all classes of seacraft” (U.S. 1828-1829). And when asked if he could prove his position, he replied, “Give us the warships to attack and come out and watch it” (Davis 71).\n\nThe emphasis of efficiency within Mitchell’s campaign, however, is quite perplexing, for while the overwhelming factor in the military’s approval of aerial warfare was the warplane’s efficiency, th ere was a much more immediate concern surrounding early aviation. In the early twenties, only a few days ever went by without the report of yet another warplane crash, another grotesque disaster in the skies. June 1921 alone yielded eight horrid tragedies, from “Lightning Bolt Felled Big Plane” to “Planes Crash in Air and Pilots Go to Death;” even movie star Jimmie Callahan’s fingers were cut off by a propeller in the process of filming a stunt (Film 10). Yet less than a month later, the military seemed ready to embrace the menacing warplane! Perhaps even more astounding was the public’s stance. Mitchell’s aerial tests sought the nation’s approval as well, and somehow his arguments compelled the press to endorse the warplane despite all the nightmarish articles they constantly published about the dangers and insecurities of aviation. Where did this appeal come from? What could possibly influence the nation to act so myopically, to embrace unflinchingly such a deadly machine?\n\nBy identifying the warplane as a “vehicle of romance,” H. Bruce Franklin argues that the warplane’s appeal stemmed from something very contrary to efficiency (55). Franklin observes the vast appeal of the plane in the “warplane models assembled by millions of boys and young men during World War II, the thousands of warplane magazines filled with glossy photographs that some find as stimulating as those in men’s magazines,” and even the movie Strategic Air Command, “in which Jimmy Stewart’s response to his first sight of a B-47 nuclear bomber is, ‘She’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen in my life’” (Franklin 54). It is this evidence, as well, that suggests that the romance generated is only a product of warplanes and not ordinary planes. Ordinary planes are useful and efficient, but load an automatic gun and a two-ton bomb aboard and the vehicle takes on a whole new persona. However, planes had already been used as bombers as early as 1915, in the midst of World War I. Mitchell wasn’t even the first to romanticize the warplane: Briton Drops Bombs at Zeebrugge Despite Heavy GermanFire Thursday night, an English warplane hovered over Zeebrugge, and, defying the concentrated fire, made a sudden dive to within 300 feet… The airman coolly dropped his bombs at short range on the submarine… There was a terrific explosion, and the submarine was sunk. The aviator got away safely (“Aviator” 1). The title suggests struggle and conflict, but the report itself lends the aviator a cool and casual air. Within this short wire, we can already see the romanticizing of both the warplane and its suave maverick cowboy-like pilot. Through his examination of various military and media transcripts, Harry H. Ransom concludes that the test bombings of 1921 were “the most significant events of the period, even more important than the total experiences of the Air Service in the [first] World War,” like the one above (27). But how could simulations carry a stronger effect than a real wartime skirmish?\n\nBecause all the bombings of 1915 were overseas, we salvaged but a few stories and no pictures; Mitchell recognized that he could not romanticize the warplane nearly as effectively through imaginative words as he could through actual images. Mitchell’s plan was far more complex than a simple test of the aircraft’s capability; aside from the designing of the largest bombs ever made and new instruments to calculate the trajectory of his new weapons, Mitchell also hired George Goddard, a young and innovative photographer, to handle public relations. “I want newsreels of those sinking ships in every theater in the country, just as soon as we can get them there,” Mitchell ordered (Davis 79). Soon Goddard’s films began screening nationwide, and the country was beginning to picture the warplane as never before.\n\n[caption id="attachment_102" align="alignright" width="159" caption="U.S. AIR FORCE, 1921"]<img class="size-full wp-image-102 " title="U.S. AIR FORCE, 1921" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/sinkingship.jpg" alt="U.S. AIR FORCE, 1921" width="159" height="565" />[/caption]\n\nMitchell invited several distinguished international delegates to witness the sinking of the Ostfriesland from a naval ship stationed nearby, the Henderson, but his greatest concern was the flock of reporters present for the event (Davis 101). Members from all the major papers, including representatives from England, Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, and Brazil, were on hand to observe and report the results. It is through the eyes of these observers and their firsthand reports that we can get a taste of the warplane’s true character.\n\nInterestingly, the reporters invariably refer to the Ostfriesland, like all ships of its time, as female; they describe how the two-thousand pound bombs “rupture her plates and bulkheads” (Hicks 36), “open her seams and make a sinking bulk of her” (Sinking 5). The personification of the battleship echoes a strong familiarity with her, a century-long history. In striking contrast, these journalists never attribute a gender to the plane; it was a mysterious stranger whose audience had not yet established a familiarity with it. This was not a mere test run but the dramatic introduction of a new character into the complex storyline that was naval warfare.\n\nMitchell actually found his two-thousand pound bombs to be more useful when they did not directly hit his target but rather land nearby; the detonation, magnified by the pressure underwater, could rip the ship’s hull apart. But the “hammer effect,” as it came to be known, was not only an efficient and useful strategy; it also left a powerful impression upon the reporters present. The underwater detonation sent a fierce shockwave through the water, causing the Henderson and its crew to shake violently and rumble (Davis 107). The terrifying effects of the ton-heavy bombs suddenly transformed the warplane from a stranger–an unfamiliar piece of machinery –into something much more awesome. The roles had been reversed; now the skies were a location of control, and the ground seemed not so safe. The association and familiarity the battleship carried also helped to intensify the drama and romanticism of the moment. While the sinking of the Ostfriesland undoubtedly proved the efficiency of the warplane ­ the ship sunk rather quickly, in under eight minutes ­ what caught its audience’s eyes was the manner in which she went down. The Ostfriesland “…in the few moments of the final plunge assumed a perpendicular position… Turning completely over, the vessel sank bottom up, the keel being the part of the ship last seen” (Hicks 36). Not much unlike another practice target, U.S. Air Force, 1921 the Frankfurt, which “was lifted bodily several feet by the blast and at once began to settle forward… [and] as she went down, her rudders and propeller rose clearly out of the water” (Hicks 36), there was an element of grace to the Ostfriesland’s ­ and any warship’s ­ destruction. It clutched from the forceful blow delivered by the plane and rolled over on its side. And just before it permanently went down, it stood itself upright in the air. One last breath, one final gasp of air, and then it slowly withered to its subterranean burial ground. The Ostfriesland didn’t just sink; it died dramatically. The bomb’s terrifying shockwaves, the battleship’s familiarity, and the Ostfriesland’s graceful burial all leant a certain drama to the spectacle and all contributed to its romanticism, but Franklin argues that they accomplished even more. By contrasting the aerial bombings to Herman Melville’s “Utalitarian View of the Monitor’s Flight,” the depiction of technology as “plain mechanic power,” Franklin suggests that these bombings not only glorified the warplane but also gave it life (Franklin 48, 54). The warplane, now infused with a soul, not only became easy to embrace, but even became easy to relate to on a personal level, as was perfectly demonstrated by Jimmy Stewart’s remarks. This personification, by no means an insignificant factor, tremendously swayed the public both to favor and trust the warplane and its aviary capabilities.\n\nOne is left to wonder, however, what kind of argument romanticism should provide for the approval of aerial combat. If the warplane truly were a danger to fly, wouldn’t our ability to relate to it like a person spur our caution and concerns and dissuade us from admiring its military capabilities? If we are truly weighing the existing dangers against our emotional investment, how can we come to pick and choose, to love the machine’s awesome and terrifying bombs and yet look away from all the imminent tragedy? Mitchell’s tests, however, did not only romantically recreate the warplane’s nature; they directly countered any previous images that may have been associated with it, like endless smoke and blazing fires from midair crashes, lightning bolts, and many other freakish disasters. On July 10th, 1921, a mere eleven days prior to Mitchell’s tests, a bombing plane spun out of control and crashed full force into Langin Field, a crowded auto field with thousands of people, killing 6 and injuring 50. The Washington Post and many other papers printed a very gruesome ­ and very real ­ photo of the ghastly wreck in the next day’s paper; thick black smoke poured from the melee, the scorching fires added to the hellishness of the scene. These images added a complication to Mitchell’s project. It would no longer suffice for Mitchell’s planes to functionally perform their task; somehow, Goddard’s films would have to not only avert the association between smoke, fire, and the warplane from people’s thoughts, but also negate that very association.\n\nPerhaps what made Goddard’s movies so effective and romantic was neither the birth of the plane nor the graceful death of the battleship. For many logical reasons the relative difficulty of hitting a floating target compared to a stationary land base, and the comparatively common presence of heavy gale winds and fog at sea ­ General Mitchell conducted his experiments on the water, but the ocean setting had an advantageous effect as well. By relying on the hammer effect to rip open the hulls of victim ships, the bombings that very next week negated the effects of the nightmarish scene at Langin Field, recreating the identity of the plane as a much quieter destructive force. Smoke was replaced with steam, fire with water. The battleship didn’t smolder; it quietly sank. Most importantly, the test left no mess behind; the surface of the water returned to its peaceful and calm state. On water, the plane didn’t just defeat the warship; it erased it from existence. On water, the plane didn’t just cause massive destruction; it also wiped it from our memories.\nThis disparity between the effects of aerial bombing on land and on sea actually played a clear role in the Navy’s decision how they would employ the use of warplanes. Captain William S. Pye, the Navy’s assistant director of their War Plans Division, argued that “if the people of the United States had seriously considered this question of international morality, they would reject the idea of strategic bombing,” thereby decreasing the need of warplanes (Ransom 28). Pye, in conclusion, felt comfortable only in using aircraft on the sea, where the civilian casualties would be reduced. However, the question here wasn’t over the efficiency of TNT as a destructive agent; all Pye debated was the proper method of delivery, by air or by sea (Goodrich 10). Perhaps the comfort Pye felt, the comfort Pye predicted Americans would feel, was the clean quiet and efficient death the warplane could administer with its mammoth, menacing, and yet relatively silent bombs. Without thick black smoke or traces of rubble, with a more graceful and romantic image to feed the nation, Mitchell had the perfect footage to deliver to its audience; the “questions of morality” had been masterfully offset.\nIt was not until 1964 that Stanley Kubrick’s cinematic satire Dr. Strangelove forced the world to consider this crime, humanity’s crime of unjustly falling in love with warfare. The movie was released at the height of the Cold War and blatantly parodied the international anxieties of pending doom, the fear that our “nuclear deterrents” could accidentally ­ and ironically ­ result in the thorough annihilation of life on Earth. But “what Kubrick’s Cold War satire showed was not men at the mercy of machines, but machines at the mercy of men,” the flawless deterrents being misused by a few flawed individuals (Ebert).\n\nThe paranoid and mentally unstable General Jack Ripper initiates a nuclear strike on the Soviet Union. In his state of paranoia, he assumes the “Commies” will try to capture and torture him for the nuclear strike recall codes; valiantly, though foolishly, Ripper commits suicide. U.S. President Merkin Muffley contacts the Soviet Premier to discuss the urgency of the matter and devise a strategy to bring down the dispatched B-52s, but the ‘serious’ phone call (“Dimitri, one of our generals, well, he went and did a silly thing… No, don’t say you’re more sorry, I’m capable of being as sorry as you”) reduces the social conflict of nuclear war to nothing more than a children’s quarrel. When the Russians complete the Doomsday Device, the ultimate nuclear deterrent incapable of being deactivated, the Premier neglects to inform the world, waiting for just the right moment to break the news; “You know how much the Premier likes surprises,” the Soviet ambassador reasons to the President. The message seems clear. Virtually every character in this film is portrayed as insane ­ though to different degrees ­ suggesting that the modern perspective of war is the product of a mental illness, one that began decades ­ if not centuries ­ ago and slowly, permanently, conditioned its way into the human mind.\n\nKubrick’s machines are more than just innocent bystanders. The Soviet Doomsday Device is treated like a real character of the movie; like the giant boards of flashing lights in the American War Room, it is capable of functioning entirely on its own. However, the Device is mistreated by mankind and forced to destroy the world. Similarly, when a soldier shoots a coke machine to take its coinage by force, the machine reacts by not only spitting out quarters but also a steady stream of cola right at its aggressor’s face. Kubrick’s audience is compelled to sympathize and rally around these mistreated machines, to love them despite all the trouble they ultimately cause.\n\nRomanticism, again, is the central tool used to create affection towards these machines. From the soothing introductory music accompanied by footage of a bomber squadron to the movie’s closing montage of mushroom clouds as Vera Lynn sings “We’ll Meet Again,” Kubrick’s choice of beautiful music helps to emphasize the beauty of his wartime footage. In “one of the most famous moments in modern film” (Ebert), Major “King” Kong, a B-52 pilot in uniform but a wild western cowboy at heart, is feverishly attempting to force open the jammed hatch underneath his plane to release the hydrogen bomb. Accidentally, he is dropped out of the plane along with the bomb as soon as the hatch is opened. Caught in the excitement of the moment, he begins to hoot and holler, waving his oversized cowboy hat in every direction, like a rugged cowboy riding a bucking bronco. Again, the romanticism is perfectly captured in Major Kong’s display, and the nuclear weapons directly responsible for nuking the Soviets, triggering the Doomsday Device, and rendering all life on Earth extinct, are seen as the misused tools of an overly malicious bombardier. Furthermore, Maj. Kong’s character is masterfully employed to offset any similarity his ride may have to Japan’s kamikaze warfare; the Japanese are remembered as evil and Kong, heroic.\n\n[caption id="attachment_310" align="alignright" width="267" caption="Dr. Strangelove, 1964"]<img class="size-full wp-image-310" title="Dr. Strangelove, 1964" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/drstrange1.jpg" alt="Dr. Strangelove, 1964" width="267" height="232" />[/caption]\n\nHowever, Kubrik’s characters are much deeper than the superficial insanity they display. If the movie were meant to criticize the social and political atmosphere of its time for falling in love with warfare, then we would expect the dangerously Dr. Strangelove, 1964 malicious Major Kong to at least make his audience flinch, yet even in this movie’s darkest moment, as Major Kong unknowingly destroys the world, the audience can’t help but laugh at his cowboy-like antics. The characters are not remembered as villains, mass murderers, or future embodiments of Adolf Hitler (the title character, Dr Strangelove, constantly represses his mechanical arm from performing the Nazi salute). Instead, they are remembered as loveable ­ though hapless and ignorant ­ heroes.\n\nPerhaps the film argues that the only thing that could cause thorough annihilation is if the entire world were to go insane at exactly the same time, like the coincidence that Russian scientists build a Doomsday Device the very week an American general psychologically breaks down. In which case, we have little to fear. We can love Major Kong for his noble intentions, and we can laugh with the president and his loony generals as they fumblingly try to save the world, though they sometimes forget that the Communists aren’t the most immediate threat anymore (“Boy, I’ve got to get me one of those Doomsday Devices!”).\n\nDr. Strangelove is much deeper than a warning of the dangers of falling in love with war.

(307, 2, '2012-04-09 15:59:51', '2012-04-09 15:59:51', 'Though seldom mentioned by American politicians and news media, the world is still recovering from the worst ecological disaster to occur in modern Europe. On November 13, 2002, the Prestige, a Greek-owned tanker carrying 84,849 tons of oil, began to fracture in choppy seas off the coast of Spain. As the leaking vessel began to slowly sink, the Dutch salvage company in charge of its rescue requested that the Prestige be towed to a small bay where the spill could be contained. After Spain refused to allow the tanker near its coast, Portugal dispatched a warship to ensure, unequivocally, that the Prestige would find no shelter in its territorial waters. Several days of debate produced a solution mutually agreed upon by the various European countries involved: tow the Prestige to Africa (Tremlett). Unfortunately for the European community, the decision was made too late— they were unable to export their problem to the developing world. The crippled boat had become completely submerged and strong currents and winds had spread oil across nearly two-hundred miles of shoreline. Since the tragedy, the once commercially viable fishing and shellfish industry has been decimated by toxic pollutants, more than 300,000 seabirds have died, and up to 24,000 tons of oil still floats in slicks off the Spanish, French, and English coasts (Brown and Tremlett).\n\nTransporting petroleum products by sea is an extraordinarily hazardous business, particularly considering that two-thirds of the world’s oil tankers have the older single-hull design, like the Prestige (Adams). The more modern double-hull tankers offer some protection from spills, but many countries, like Russia, have yet to begin replacing older ships which the International Maritime Organization has required to be phased out by 2015 (Brown). Even with the limited protection provided by a double-hull, spills are bound to happen. The four major cleanup methods—containment, skimming, solvents, and burning— are poor at best. Containment by floating barriers fails in rough seas, skimming only recovers oil from the water’s surface, solvents come with their own potential for ecological damage, and burning causes terrible air pollution (Adams). The reality is that the more oil we ship across the ocean, the more we increase the chances of catastrophe.\n\nSadly, the dangers involved in the international petroleum business are not restricted to transport; the dangers include hostile geo-political relations. Yet, blaming the oil industry for current American aggression in the Middle East does nothing to reduce the underlying issues surrounding this international conflict. “Blood for oil” may be a catchy slogan and it may be justified, but adopting platitudes fails to answer the why. The core of this question centers on individual responsibility and the environment. In war and the global ecosystem, why is there an “us” and a “them”? In order to respond to this question it becomes necessary to examine the actions of, not simply our military, but all personnel presently conducting business abroad which could affect ecological or political stability.\n\nForeign governments’ environmental restrictions on oil operations pale in comparison to those of the United States. Multinational corporations embrace these lax regulations overseas as a means to save money. However, cutting corners financially has resulted in dire consequences ecologically. In Ecuador, for example, an ongoing lawsuit has accused ChevronTexaco of polluting 2.5 million acres of rainforest. Rather than properly disposing of toxic waste, ChevronTexaco discharged up to four million gallons a day of heavy-metal contaminated wastewater directly into the Amazon wetlands. Additionally, they discarded liquid drilling waste in hundreds of open, unlined pits, near dozens of indigenous villages (Vidal). In the United States, these would have been flagrant environmental violations leading to criminal prosecutions. In Ecuador, ChevronTexaco saved four billion dollars and may eventually have to pay minor reparations. With no rules governing global drilling operations, the oil industry has no incentive to respect fragile environments abroad.\n\nIt’s unfortunate we need the oil industry at all, but consumption of oil and gas in the United States continues to rise. Even if we assume that the tireless efforts of conservationists will succeed and hydrocarbon usage will not increase, our current level of consumption is staggering. The United States makes up less than five percent of the world’s population, yet we devour more than twenty-five percent of its petroleum (NationMaster). Annually, slightly more than half of the oil we burn through is imported. Virtually all of this imported crude is produced in countries with substandard environmental regulations and then shipped via tanker to the United States. In order to minimize damage to the global ecosystem, petroleum production must be conducted under strictly controlled conditions and transport across oceans must be curtailed.\n\nEnvironmentalists unanimously agree that any drilling operations should be executed with absolute care. The problem is, realistically, there are very few places where production can be rigorously controlled. Compounding this, the few nations who demand corporations comply with strict environmental guidelines also seem to hold fast to the contradictory ideal: “Not in my backyard.” Crowds cheer outside a courthouse after an injunction is handed down blocking an oil company from drilling in their area. The people, proud they were able to protect their community, return to normal life without a thought to the consequences of their actions. The oil industry is constantly searching for more production; when they are denied in one region it is easy to find another where the locals do not have access to the same time, education, and finances that would allow them to fully comprehend the potential harm to their environment. Don’t all people, regardless of background, deserve the same protections for their land and waterways?\n\nApparently in Russia, they do not. Sakhalin Island is at the far northeast corner of Russia. After repeatedly being denied drilling permits on federal land in Alaska, ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch/Shell simply sought a target that most similarly matched the Alaskan coast in reservoir volume and geology. In this case, the target happened to lie directly across the bay on Sakhalin Island, Russia. Of course, Sakhalin is not protected by the same environmental rules that govern Alaska.\n\n<em>The</em> <em>Wall Street Journal</em>’s Jim Carlton said of the situation, “Therein lies a global tradeoff: As environmental groups scramble to shield one piece of the planet from oil exploration, the drilling rigs pop up on another sensitive front.” Since the start of the Sakhalin project, ExxonMobil has allowed seismic blasting within 2.5 miles of endangered gray whales. In Alaska, a 12-mile buffer is enforced to keep from driving the whales away from migratory routes and feeding grounds. Shell regularly discharges toxic drilling muds into shallow ocean water. All such dumping is prohibited in Alaska to protect marine life.\n\nTo date, neither company has put forth any method to protect salmon from pipeline discharges, while a specific plan is required in the United States. Perhaps most disturbing is that multinationals transport the oil, by tanker, through the Tartar Straits in winter broken-ice conditions. In 2000, Alaska forced the oil industry to run spill cleanup tests in broken-ice— the corporations failed every test. Since then, tanker transport in Alaska, minimal already as a result of extensive pipeline infrastructure, is halted during broken-ice conditions (Carlton). Ultimately, the perpetuation of environmental nationalism contradicts the realities of a global ecosystem. In order to stop the “global tradeoff,” we must direct the resource industry to locations with the most rigid environmental laws.\n\nThe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is one such location. To clarify, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, or ANWR, encompasses 19.5 million-acres of Alaska’s northeast corner. The sole area that has ever been discussed as a possible exploration target is the ANWR’s 1.5 million-acre coastal strip. The last plan debated proposed opening seven percent of the ANWR for drilling. Most environmental organizations estimate the reserves at around 3.2 billion barrels of oil, whereas industry studies put the number at 16 billion barrels. Using just the low-end figure, the United States could replace six years crude oil supply from our largest and most contentious importing region— the Middle East (ANWR).\n\nThe ANWR makes an ideal site not only due to its substantial reserves, but because public concern would force all drilling operations to be conducted under an environmental microscope. In fact, the state of Alaska proudly proclaims the environmental restrictions it places on the petroleum industry are the “most heavily regulated in the world” (ANWR). However, in addition to volume and environmental standards, there is one other factor that must be considered in this particular area— the opinion of the Native Americans who live there.\n\nThe Eskimos are the lone inhabitants of the ANWR, and although some individual tribes dissent, most support opening up their lands to drilling. Nicholas D. Kristof, of the <em>New York Times</em>, summed up the Eskimo’s sentiments after spending a week in the ANWR, “Some resent the idea that American environmentalists 5,000 miles away want to lock them forever in a quaint wilderness, just for the psychic value of knowing that it is there.” As Kristof discovered, Alaska’s indigenous community sees oil drilling as a means to achieve better schools and more jobs. They are upset that people who live elsewhere deny them access to more comfortable lives. The Eskimos are no strangers to petroleum as oil has pooled in patches along their coastal lands for thousands of years. In an interview with an Eskimo tribesman, Kristof states that Bert Akootchoot “angrily told me that if environmentalists were so anxious about the Arctic, they should come here and clean up the petroleum that naturally seeps to the surface of the tundra.” The human factor, particularly from a too often ignored population segment, lends credible weight to the already sound argument in favor of oil drilling in the ANWR.\n\nThe ANWR’s oil could be best leveraged by coupling it with a substantial source of natural gas in order to ensure the United States lasting sovereignty as an energy producer. Gas is rapidly becoming the more important resource as the United States shifts its energy policies. Ninety percent of all new power plants in the United States will utilize natural gas (Raabe). Yet, many existing gas plants, particularly in California, currently operate at less than full capacity due to a shortage in supply. Trends among electricity producers suggest a steadily increasing demand for natural gas. This is good news for the environment since gas burns far cleaner than coal or oil. Moreover, by furthering our reliance on gas, we decrease dependence on foreign nations for oil. The question then becomes, where will this gas come from? The Rocky Mountain Front is estimated to contain 2.2 trillion cubic feet of gas (Herring). That’s roughly forty-one percent of the gas reserves in the United States. Most of it lies beneath federal lands: Glacier National Park, the Scapegoat Wilderness Area, and the Lewis and Clark reserve. For the moment, these lands are completely closed to drilling.\n\nThe argument for drilling in the Rocky Mountain Front is similar to that of the ANWR. However, it is worth mentioning the significant technological improvements that make drilling, particularly for gas, more friendly to the environment. Directional drilling allows multiple wells to be drilled from one location. Prior to directional drilling, each well would need its own well-bore and ground level pad with associated machinery. Gas wells, which are generally much deeper than oil wells, require enormous drilling rigs which initially had to be moved around from one pad to the next.\n\nAll of this contributed to far more clutter above and below ground. Now, rigs are often fixed to a particular location, much like an offshore platform. This drastically cuts down on subterranean ecological damage and also reduces the surface drilling area to a fraction of its original size. In turn, this provides drilling operators a much better opportunity to hide their equipment, thus minimizing the negative impact on wilderness scenery. The aesthetics of the Rocky Mountain Front are, understandably, of great concern to those who live in the surrounding region. Yet, there is more at stake than just aesthetics, and unlike Alaska’s ANWR, the Rocky Mountain community is split on whether to allow drilling or not.\n\nA large portion of the population in and immediately adjacent to the Rocky Mountain Front’s federal lands fall into two demographics: poor working class families or wealthy landowners. The working class fills the industrial labor jobs in mills, mines, quarries, and the like. The wealthy are mostly vacation home owners with mountain escapes. Not surprisingly, the poor favor drilling since its revenues will likely lend their communities a much needed economic boost. Nonprofit groups advocating the development of federal land support these local economic interests with appeals to the national concern regarding consumption.\n\nClaire Moseley of Public Lands Advocacy, a grassroots organization formed by local laborers, recently said of the Rocky Mountain National Front, “We think it is one of the most important reserves in the country… and it makes no sense to set it aside when we are facing natural gas shortages” (Herring). The potential positive effects on the lives of their neighbors and on the nation’s energy supply fail to influence the wealthy part-time residents who continue to oppose any drilling outright. Undoubtedly, they would grumble if their home/private ski lodge had no heat to keep their guests warm or no lights to distinguish the scotch from the bourbon. At the same time, the thought of oil drilling near their pristine manicured landscape would most certainly elicit the familiar response, “Not in my backyard.” Consequently, for the moment, the Rocky Mountain Front’s local population stands at an impasse.\n\nToo often the debate regarding domestic drilling is stalemated because no room is left for compromise. Proposed policies seem to be one extreme or the other. The environmentalists oppose all drilling period, while the energy industry wants complete autonomy to drill anywhere. This issue is not so black and white; the solution is dependant on finding a middle ground. A plan must be formulated which benefits both sides without antagonizing the opposition. Industry could be allowed careful exploration in the ANWR and the Rocky Mountain Front, potentially followed by limited commercial drilling. In exchange, there should be an increase in carbon emissions standards, major additional funding for studies on renewable energy, incentives for corporations who produce energy saving products, and more stringent vehicle mileage requirements.\n\nThis line of thinking is slowly gaining support. Yale’s esteemed environmental law professor, Daniel Esty, has proposed a similar policy and other academics are beginning to investigate taking a middle-of-the-road stance (Kristof). Nationally, the benefits to this approach would include a decline in air pollution, real advances in the pursuit for “clean” power, a reduction in electricity and fuel consumption, and most significantly, decreased reliance on foreign oil imports.\n\nInternationally, it is essential that we reach an agreement on this issue since the United States foreign policy is and is perceived to be dictated by our energy policy. Going back several decades, all our presidential administrations have made securing resources a strategic priority. In 1980, Jimmy Carter said that any attempt to impede the flow of oil in the Persian Gulf would be regarded as an “assault on the vital interests of the United States,” and would be “repelled by any means necessary, including military force.” More recently, an energy review, launched by Dick Cheney in May 2002, recommended to President Bush that he “make energy security a priority of our trade and foreign policy” (Vidal). Regardless of how intertwined these policies actually are, foreign nations, particularly in the Middle East, believe petroleum to be the key catalyst for United States military action.\n\nJust over a year ago,<em> The Brookings Review</em> published a survey conducted in six Arab countries by Shibley Telhami, professor for Peace and Development at the University of Maryland, which found that an overwhelming majority of those polled expressed a negative opinion of the United States. The respondents explained that their view was based on American policy in the Middle East. When asked what motivates this policy, eighty percent answered “oil.” The answers given least frequently were: “democracy, economic development, or peace.” Without altering this viewpoint, there remains a worldwide threat of conflict, as evidenced by the ongoing wars in eight of the top twelve nations with the most proven oil reserves (Vidal). This perceived connection, between foreign policy and energy, is not limited to an international audience.\n\nIn the United States, beginning January 2003, a series of television commercials proposed a link between geo-political instability and petroleum. One of the ads went as follows: A man is shown filling up his vehicle while a child’s voice says: “This is George. This is the gas that George bought for his SUV.” A map of the Middle East showing Iraq and Saudi Arabia appears and the voice-over continues: “These are the countries where the executives bought the oil that made the gas.” Over a shot of a terrorist training camp, it says: “And these are the terrorists who get money from those countries every time George fills up his SUV.” (Campbell)\n\nWhile the specific logic depicted in this commercial can be argued, it demonstrates that an association exists here in the United States. Popular perception ties international conflict to America’s relationship with the environment, and generally speaking this is not too far from the truth. Through war and through oil excavation and transport practices, the world’s ecosystem and its people are harmed. In the United States, we have the means to reduce the chance of international disaster by working together. Environmentalists and the petroleum industry must set aside their differences and compromise. Additionally, Americans must remember that though we may be a part of a neighborhood, a city, a state, and a country, we are also a part of the global community. Now more than ever, the United States is interconnected with the worldwide economy and environment. There is no escaping the repercussions of global mismanagement. Given America’s high consumption and low production, it must seem insulting to use force or support environmental damage in other countries to obtain energy. It is not worth preserving our land if we destroy someone else’s. After all, the Earth is everyone’s backyard.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;', 'A Hostile Environment:The Pursuit of Oil in a Global Age', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '295-autosave', '', '', '2012-04-09 15:59:51', '2012-04-09 15:59:51', '', 295, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?p=307', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

This is a (among others) women’s rights issue.” Along with civil laws introduced after the 1979 Islamic Revolution that categorize women as “half of men” (in terms of witness testimony, blood money for murder, etc.), one of the contentious women’s rights issues in Iran is the mandatory veil2. Iran is one of the few countries in the world with four distinct seasons. The summers are hot, if not boiling—100ºF in July. You’d be inclined to wear shorts perhaps, but if you are female, that would mean putting yourself at risk of imprisonment, flogging or a fine. Per Article 638 of the Islamic Penal Code of Iran, “Women who appear in public without a proper hijab should be imprisoned from ten days to two months or pay a fine of 50,000 to 500,000 Ryal.” 3\r\n\r\nIn his essay “Behind the Official Story,” James Scott discusses the discrepancy between how people “appear in public” and how they act in private. Of relevance and interest here is the “public performance required of those subject to elaborate and systematic forms of social subordination” (2). Muslim women the world over choose to wear the veil. But when wearing the veil is mandated by law—as in Iran—it becomes unclear whether women wear it out of genuine personal and/or religious motivations, or merely to satisfy a public image required by law, as part of a mandatory “public performance” (2). Early in his essay, Scott distinguishes between the “public transcript” and the “private transcript.” His analysis and examples deal chiefly with the divide between public and private verbal interaction. However, he does note: “A second and vital aspect of the hidden transcript that has not been sufficiently emphasized is that it does not contain only speech acts but a whole range of practices” (14). Scott identifies practices such as “poaching, pilfering, clandestine tax evasion” on part of the dominated ones and “luxury and privilege, surreptitious use of hired thugs, bribery and tampering with land titles” on part of the dominators (14). In “Behind the Official Story,” Scott goes beyond chronicling the difference between what subordinates are able to say in the presence of their dominators (“public transcript”) and what they can only speak of among themselves (“private transcript”) and vice versa; he ultimately calls into question the entire functioning of power structures in society. It is worth examining the “theatrical imperatives that normally prevail in situations of domination” in the case of the veiled versus the unveiled woman. 4\r\n\r\nIn her autobiographical graphic novel Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood, Marjane Satrapi traces her childhood in post-revolutionary Tehran. The first section, entitled “The Veil,” speaks of “1980: the year it became obligatory to wear the veil at school” (3) 5. Born into a “very modern and avant-garde” (6) family, Satrapi faces an identity crisis caused by the clash between the pro-revolutionary undercurrents at school and opposing opinions at home, until she “really do[es]n’t know what to think about the veil” (6). Satrapi emphasizes the stark contrast between her two identities by using only two colors, black and white, for all of the book’s illustrations. The image on page 6 is especially powerful, split down the middle with a black background on the left and a white background on the right. Yet it is far from symmetrical: on the left Satrapi is unveiled, and on the right she is veiled. Interestingly, the background on the left depicts a ruler, a hammer and cogs, images associated with work and possibly a career. The background on the right, by contrast, depicts quintessential Islamic floral designs. Along with the mandatory veil law came additional limitations on women’s freedom, so the veiled woman was more restricted to the home than her previously unveiled self. Article 1105 of the Civil Code of Iran states: “In relations between husband and wife; the position of the head of the family is the exclusive right of the husband.” 6 Thus, the dichotomy between the private and public “transcripts” of women can be seen as a parallel to the dichotomy in gender roles brought about by gender-specific laws. Recently, loaded phrases such as “looking beyond the veil,” “behind the veil” and “you can’t judge a woman by her cover” have been used as the clichéd titles of documentaries and feature stories, perhaps because the veil denotes a symbolic barrier between the public, veiled woman and her private, unveiled counterpart. The veil is more than just an article of clothing; it is, in fact, an entire mode of conduct.\r\n\r\nAs discussed earlier, the mandatory veil law was accompanied by other restrictive laws concerning how a woman must act—or, in Scott’s terminology, “perform”—in public. Thus, the differences between a woman when she is veiled and when she is unveiled extend beyond her speech to her behavior, actions and gestures. Persepolis helps us detect such nuances through pointed illustrations. Without her veil, Satrapi’s mother is an outspoken liberal: on page 76, she is pictured with short hair, arched eyebrows, a strong mouth and a fist in the air, along with a speech bubble adamantly declaring: “She (Marjane) should start learning to defend her rights as a woman right now!” Contrast this with the meek depiction of her public self when confronted by the infamous “morality police”: she is veiled and her eyes are visibly wider as she thanks the policeman almost too profusely for letting her husband go without charges: “Thanks, thanks so much!” (109). Instead of being clenched in a fist, her hands are shown raised with palms facing outward in a gesture of surrender. Even within a single image, Satrapi subtly suggests the existence of dichotomies.\r\n\r\nAlthough Satrapi’s mother looks self-assured and confident on p.76, Satrapi divides her face into a white left-half and a black right-half. Are we to understand, then, that even when the woman is unveiled and in private, her public veiled self is present within her? Scott posits that “those obliged by domination to act a mask will eventually find that their faces have grown to fit that mask” (10). It is possible that in this nuanced image, Satrapi is pointing towards the same idea – that Satrapi’s mother cannot shed her public mask completely even in private. In other words, while the material veil may be removed upon entering the house, shedding the non-corporeal veil is not so simple. It may also be worth noting that Satrapi colors the outspoken part of Satrapi’s mother (with the raised fist) black; the use of black may indicate obscurity – emphasizing that this part of Satrapi’s mother must remain private, hidden. Interestingly, the behavior of Satrapi’s father, who is obviously unveiled at all times, is a lot more consistent. He talks back to the same police officer, saying, “I won’t take that from you. For twenty years I’ve worked for this country and you dare to talk to me like that?” (108) and thus risks arrest on grounds of insolence. In this instance, it may be relevant to consider Scott’s “crude and global generalization” that “the greater the disparity in power … the more the public transcript of subordinates will take on a stereotyped, ritualistic cast … the more menacing the power, the thicker the mask” (3). The disparity in power between a policeman and a veiled civilian female is greater than that between a policeman and a civilian male. This is partially due to the vastly different legal systems for females and males. Article 638 of the Islamic Penal Code of Iran (above) dealing with “Offenses Against Public Morals” applies exclusively to women. Thus, this power disparity makes for a greater disparity between a woman’s public and hidden personas than a man’s. Yet, assuming that the mandatory veil law is repressive and requires a “public performance” from women is a dangerous generalization because there are many women in Iran who, regardless of the law, would wear the veil out of personal conviction. The fact that many Muslim women living in countries without such laws choose to wear a veil should give us pause. Scott recognizes this problem when he writes of the danger of assuming that public conduct is, in fact, a performance: What warrant have we to call it a performance at all, thereby impugning its authenticity?\r\n\r\nThe answer is, surely, that we cannot know how contrived or imposed the performance is unless we can speak, as it were, to the performer offstage, out of this particular power-laden context, or unless the performer suddenly declares openly, on stage, that the performances we have previously observed were just a pose? (4) Since Persepolis is a first-person narrative, we are given insight into Satrapi’s personal views on the veil in particular and the post-revolutionary regime in general. We also see marked differences between how she conducts (or is forced to conduct) herself on the streets of Tehran and how she rebels within the four walls of her room, listening to rock music: “I put my posters up in my room. I put my 1983 Nikes on … and my denim jacket with the Michael Jackson button” (131). The material transformation from the private unveiled to the public veiled self is perhaps best illustrated by the images on page 131. Notice how Satrapi changes from a typical wild teenager playing air guitar in front of an Iron Maiden poster to a slightly mischievous one tying her laces and, finally, to a demure, sedated young woman after she has donned her veil in the last image.\r\n\r\nIt is worth observing that the quintessentially Western concepts of rock bands and branded shoes are associated with the private self, while the public self reflects Iranian and Islamic culture. This should have great ramifications for our understanding of gender discriminatory laws: there were obviously political as well as religious motives for the Islamic Revolution that overthrew the pro-Western Shah and led to the introduction of the laws in question. Satrapi also reveals how women who do not personally agree with the law subtly express their otherwise hidden views in public: “In no time, the way people dressed became an ideological sign. There were two kinds of women. The Fundamentalist Woman. The Modern Woman. You showed your opposition to the regime by letting a few strands of hair show” (75). These understated acts of defiance allow us to distinguish between performers and those who act out of personal conviction. What, though, is the consequence of the hidden transcript becoming public, even subtly so? Punishment by law aside, the non-conforming woman faces threats and public humiliation if she fails to play the part of the veiled woman adequately.\r\n\r\nWhen Satrapi steps out into the streets wearing her denim jacket and her Michael Jackson pin, showing a few defiant strands of hair, she is confronted by “The Guardians of the Revolution: The Women’s Branch” (132) who call her a “whore,” among other things (133). It is intriguing how women subject to the same laws choose to enforce them on other women in the same position as themselves. The motivations for such treatment of women by women are puzzling; a possible explanation could be that in the strictest view of Islam, men are not allowed to touch female suspects and, thus, in Iran it is generally female police officers (often casually referred to as the “fashion police”) who deal with women who violate the dress code. A more vociferous show of opposition has more dire consequences, as we see when a group of unveiled women rallying against the regime and the veil law are suppressed by violence: “The scarf or a beating” (76). The result of such suppression is then, of course, a more defined boundary between the hidden and the public transcript, and a thicker public mask: “That was our last demonstration” (76). As readers of Persepolis, we must understand the historical situation—it portrays the immediate aftermath of the Islamic Revolution in Iran. The book is based on Satrapi’s own childhood in the early 1980s. The laws in Iran have undergone amendments since then, leading to altered power-dynamics. Under President Mohammad Khatami, who was elected in 1997, enforcement of the veil law was loosened, which led to women wearing shorter coats, looser scarves and more colorful clothing. More importantly, Iranian women today are reentering the job market, the number of Iranian women graduating from college is surpassing the number of men, and women are also participating in the democratic process as elected members of the Islamic Consultative Assembly, Iran’s national legislative body.\r\n\r\nAs the power balance in any domination paradigm (in this case, the state-citizen paradigm) varies, so too do the nature and extent of a “hidden transcript.” One could say that under more liberal conditions, the veil slips back both literally and figuratively, and that there is now less of a barrier between the public veiled woman and her private unveiled self. However, as Scott points out, “power relations are not, alas, so straightforward” (5), and so to assume a directly proportional relationship between the stringency of laws and the extent of a hidden transcript amounts to oversimplification. While a connection obviously exists, in a scenario where there is such a clear division between choice and compulsion, the dangers of generalization are far too great for us to draw a definitive conclusion. Still, it may be safe to say that since the early 1980s, the black-and-white contrast of Satrapi’s Iran has made way for less stark shades of gray.\r\n<h2> Note</h2>\r\n1. FitzGerald, Edward.

(502, 3, '2012-04-10 18:40:24', '2012-04-10 18:40:24', 'In considering our life philosophies, it is hard to distinguish between what we accept through mere faith and what we arrive at through thought and mental discipline.  And further, what happens when these two modes of our understanding collide?  It would seem that belief and reason are mutually exclusive, that whenever they come into contact there must be a victor and a loser—that a choice must be made about which way of understanding we choose to embrace.  We struggle daily to reconcile the beliefs we choose to accept with the empirical knowledge we cannot ignore.\r\n\r\nE.M. Forster’s essay, “What I Believe” addresses this pervasive mental struggle.  Forster’s ultimate humanist goal in the essay is to find a life philosophy independent from the dogma of religion, evidenced by his opening sentences, “I do not believe in Belief.  But this is an age of faith, and there are so many militant creeds that, in self-defense, one has to formulate a creed of one’s own” (67).  He suggests his era embraces the notion of religious faith too wholeheartedly, and he wants to develop a functional alternative.  To achieve this, Forster affirms that life should be lived to create, ultimately, “tolerance, good temper, and sympathy” (67). In his attempt to reach this philosophical ideal, he highlights the inevitability of turning to belief, even in his fiercely non-religious worldview. Forster’s essay raises, and may implicitly answer, the enduring question: <em>Can reason coexist with belief?</em>  In the essay, it becomes apparent that reason <em>can</em>, in fact, coexist with belief, provided that belief is founded upon and cooperative with empirical and philosophical derivations.  That is, provided it is not <em>blind</em> faith.\r\n\r\nFrom the outset of his essay, Forster criticizes religion and the tenets it seeks to uphold.  The very first sentence of the essay, “I do not believe in belief,” suggests that Forster withholds his commitment to anything requiring blind-faith acceptance of a rule (67).  He feels assaulted by the “militant creeds” of the Age of Faith, or religious reactionism, and writes in part to defend his humanistic principles against this threat (67).  One of the more pointed rejections of religious faith is expressed in his discussion of the principles of Christianity, “[The orthodox say] man has failed and always will fail to organize his own goodness, and it is presumptuous of him to try.  This claim—solemn as it is— leaves me cold.  I cannot believe that Christianity will ever cope with the present worldwide mess…” (75).  He is arguing that it is man’s <em>duty</em> to clarify for himself his own values. This argument for intellectual independence characterizes Forster’s stance on the issue of belief, leaving no doubt that he is opposed to religious faith.\r\n\r\nA consequence of Forster’s wholehearted rejection of blind faith, religion, and maybe even God, is that is seems he must develop his own philosophy based exclusively on reason.  But paradoxically peppered throughout the essay are passages that both triumphantly accept reason, and implicitly praise faith. This is not a logical pitfall of Forster’s essay but a manifestation of the subtle distinction between religious faith and humanistic faith that Forster seeks to establish.  Regarding personal relationships he claims, “For the purpose of living one has to assume that the personality is solid and the self is an entity, and to ignore all contrary evidence.  And since to ignore evidence is one of the characteristics of faith, I can certainly proclaim I believe in personal relationships” (68). Furthermore, he explains, “The people I respect most behave as if they were immortal and as if society was eternal” (71).  Both these quotes contain an explicit abandonment of reason and an acceptance of faith.  But even so, Forster carves a distinction between the religious belief he feels is reckless and the principled belief he feels is both constructive and unavoidable.  Subscribing to religious dogma does not satisfy Forster’s skeptical stance on faith, but holding to considered, principled beliefs like the ones above do.  Ultimately, he understands that reason and belief are hopelessly intertwined, and that there is a correct and constructive way to arrive at belief, and an incorrect, destructive way.  Given the historical context of the essay, this principle is particularly poignant.\r\n\r\nPublished in 1938, “What I Believe” was written in the throes of the political and social instability that led to World War II. A number of remarks within the essay point to Forster’s acute awareness of the unrest of the time.  He discusses a “gathering political storm,” mentions the merits of democracy allowing “public criticism” and avoiding “hushed up scandals,” mentions “labor camps” as a consequence of extreme governmental control, and notably ambiguously asserts “some people idealize force and pull it to the foreground and worship it” (68, 69, 70). Clearly, Forster was well aware of the brewing political issues of World War II and his essay is in part a reaction to the philosophical confusion and gravity of the coming war.  When viewed in this light, the dissonance between belief and reason takes on new meaning.  The war itself highlighted the fact that two logically derived diverging philosophies can exist and each side may still vehemently oppose the other. In the struggle of democracy vs. totalitarianism at which Forster hints heavily, both sides had justifications for their stances and, of course, their rhetoric for each would have been particularly pervasive in 1938.  The Axis powers asserted that totalitarianism provided order, cohesion, obedience, and efficiency and the Allied powers argued democracy promoted free speech, individual liberties, creativity, and social justice (Palmieri, Griggs ).  Both sides had their intellectual stances, but both possessed something further: faith that their cause was correct. Just as Forster sought to define a humanistic philosophy that satisfied his ideals, the two sides developed their philosophies to satisfy their preconceived faith.  Forster captures this quiet parallel in his extensive discussion of democracy, and maybe most revealingly demonstrates his fears in the conclusion of his essay, “…one likes to say what one thinks while speech is comparatively free: it may not be free much longer” (76).  Clearly, Forster understands the war and its ideological struggle may come at a heavy cost.\r\n\r\nBut what is the importance of the philosophical dichotomy between the Allied and Axis powers and its phantom presence within the context of Forster’s essay?  It illustrates how belief is inexorably intertwined with reason.  That is, we use reason to accommodate belief and belief to accommodate reason.  Forster, in his essay, was using the irony of rejecting one belief and asserting another to capture the futility of arguing a point based largely, or entirely, on blind faith.  This parallels the political struggle of the time.  At the same time, he understands faith is inevitable and is wrestling with the implications of this reality.  Faced with war and the potential losses of lives and freedom, a satisfying solution to the issue of belief vs. reason seems particularly urgent.  Ultimately, he knows he cannot argue his worldview against another if it is buoyed by dogma, so he seeks to change faith’s “big ‘F’” to a little “f” by transforming the monolithic faith necessary for religion with one that coincides with our innate sense of common humanity.  He explains that the religious, those whose faith he does not support, “have faith with a large F.  My faith has a very small one, and I only intrude it because these are very strenuous days” (76).\r\n\r\nTo Forster, faith is inevitable; blind faith is not.  He illustrates that at some level we must accept certain central axioms on faith to live our intellectual lives at all (belief in personal relationships, the permanence of human civilization, democracy, an aristocracy of intelligentsia, etc.).  We do not and cannot know if these are true, but our choice of what and what not to have faith in is not necessarily blind.  It reflects our understanding of how the world is, and how we feel it should be, an empirically idealistic guess. Forster and those who subscribe to his distinction between beliefs, attempt to capture how the world appears, and further, how it <em>should</em> work.  Forster embraces relationships, aristocracy of intelligentsia, living life as if it had no end, and acting as if civilization was eternal not because he knows these things are true, but because these satisfy his understanding of how the world must exist for a philosophically, humanistically, and personally satisfying life.\r\n\r\nForster does not reject faith—only faith stemming from religion.  The chief difference between faith in religion and faith in principles, and the reason Forster makes this seemingly “splitting hairs” distinction, is that the former must necessarily be blind, while the latter is informed to the extent it reflects some ideal about the human condition reached through consideration, not dogmatic acceptance.  Belief and reason are not in fact mutually exclusive, but are both unavoidable and can even complement each other handsomely, provided that faith is not employed as a simplistic and convenient replacement for thought, but as a mechanism for developing informed principles.', 'The Necessity of Belief', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'the-necessity-of-belief-2', '', '', '2012-04-10 19:03:14', '2012-04-10 19:03:14', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=502', 0, 'essay', '', 0);

Messages need to be archived.]\r\n\r\nDear Readers,\r\n\r\nThe essayist Randolph Bourne--a leftist intellectual and graduate of Columbia University''s class of 1905(?) rejected the possibility of young people writing meaningful essays. “The youthful essayist,” he wrote in the month before his death in 1918, “is afraid you will think he is unsophisticated, while the middle-aged doesn’t much care if you do. […] The youthful essayist usually develops into the professional anecdotalist, with an active mind that is harnessed up to no real thinking but can only stream off from itself a futile current of incident” (506). This is a strange—even a disheartening—sentiment to hear from Bourne, an essayist who never made it to sanguine middle age himself. He was writing, however, about the "light essay," a form of the essay that was epitomized by such well known writers as Charles Lamb. But Bourne, while insightful about many things, including the dangers of American thinkers tacitly approving the first World War, because they did not sufficiently consider what it asked us to rethink about democracy itself, was wrong about the essay. And Bourne also here fails to mention his own first attempts to do "real thinking" in essays in the Columbia Monthly, including articles on X, Y, and Z. If Bourne were a first year student at Columbia today, I would guess that he would be a prolific blogger, and would seek out as many opportunities for explorations of his ideas in public as he could.\r\n\r\nTo write an essay to an imagined (and actual) audience of smart readers who are not familiar with the particulars of the issues that concern oneself, but who can become interested by them is no small feat. To write both persuasively, thoughtfully, responsibly about questions about contemporary topics ranging from use of placebos trials to the complexity of drag performance, or the lasting effects of DADT despite its revocation situates the student writer as a person who can and should speak/write publicly on these issues--not to simply express his or her opinions, but to begin the heady process of entering into an existing intellectual conversation and exchange of ideas.\r\n\r\nThere is a genre called the essay which is particularly flexible and able to accomodate a wide range of subjects, writerly stances, aesthetic experiments and argumentative strategies. It is the essay''s diversity that this publication showcases and celebrates, although we do emphasize essays that make their arguments rather more explicitly than those on the more implicit and elliptical end of the spectrum.\r\n\r\nI am proud and fascinated of the work that students who are new to this form of writing have been able to accomplish with one semester''s worth of hard study of the genre''s requirements. And of all of what essay asks, it most demands that its writers show up and make their thinking visible to others on the page. This is no solipsistic act--the ideas are there because they are meaningful and could be meaningful to others.\r\n\r\nThe Core curriculum at Columbia includes many famous essayists on its curriculum, including both Michel de Montaigne and Francis Bacon. How fitting then that as students begin their study here that they might find a space to conduct their own experiments in thinking in the only course at Columbia that is required of all first year students: University Writing.\r\n\r\nAs you consider the essays in this journal, you might find it interesting to see how even the most timely of or students'' arguments--that respond to key controversies of their day--the Jessica Lynch story, the Borat movie, the RiceTek patenting case feature ideas that are of lasting interest and merit. This is why essays in the world continue to be read long after their timeliness--their kairotic appeals--diminish: because in the presence of a thinker working carefully to craft an idea about a text well known or just discovered, we feel the thrill of a moment of invention. In essays these moments are not preserved or fixed but recreated, and the force of the best essays by writers regardless of their age is that of the click--the idea that was nascent and only dimmly detected made visible and sharable with others. The art of the essay is alive and well at Columbia and we look forward to many more volumes of The Morningside Review to show us of what new essaysists in our midsts can contribute to the form.\r\n\r\nWith all best wishes,\r\nNicole B.

(325, 8, '2012-02-27 03:41:25', '2012-02-27 03:41:25', 'The word “war” evokes a montage of images so extensive it seems impossible to choose just one. We hear “war” and we think of massive green army tanks rolling over a sandy landscape in Iraq, blood-streaked victims of a suicide bombing in Israel, the barrel of a gun pointing out over a stone wall during the Civil War, or a phalanx of silver armor flooding across a hillside in the Trojan War. Ask a war veteran to imagine war, however, and he will conjure a narrower set of images: the bodies of fishermen and children strewn across a riverbank at dawn; the empty space where a friend used to stand a minute before a mine went off; or blood dripping on the back of one’s own hand after firing the first shot (Shay, Achilles in Vietnam 3, 71, 78).\n\nWhat distinguishes the images of war in the mind of a war veteran from those in the mind of an ordinary civilian is that the former are first-hand accounts. They have not been filtered through a camera lens or a reporter’s pen. According to essayist Susan Sontag, this discrepancy is immutable and insurmountable. She ends her essay “Looking at War,” a discussion of the evolution, importance, and complexity of war photography, with this very sentiment: “We don’t get it. We truly can’t imagine what it was like…That’s what every soldier, and every journalist and aid worker and independent observer who has put in time under fire…stubbornly feels. And they are right” (98). With her last lines, Sontag casts the rest of her essay in a critical, if not dubious, light. All the images of war she has spent so much time discussing—images that have occupied the global consciousness since the camera’s invention in 1839—are only that: images. They will never accurately render the disorienting, dehumanizing, and transformative experience of battle.\n\nSontag’s admission begs the question: If we are truly incapable of conceiving of the reality of war, what use are war images? Sontag suggests that one possible motivation behind a war image is to provoke the viewer to oppose war (97). But she points out that a narrative is likely to be more effective than an image in arousing protest. She explains: “Partly it is a question of the length of time one is obliged to look, and to feel. No photograph…can unfold, go further” (98). Narrative, it seems, has more potential than a photograph to recall war faithfully enough to arouse active opposition. And unlike a photograph, whose meaning can be altered based on the caption (Sontag sites a photograph of children killed in the shelling of a village that was passed around at both Serb and Croat propaganda briefings), a narrative’s meaning cannot be radically transformed by the addition of a footnote or an addendum (86). Narrative, it seems, offers a less-easily manipulated depiction of war that can prompt activism more effectively than an image.\n\nBut Sontag explains that unlike a narrative, a photograph is universal—it does not exclude its audience based on the language it uses or the references it makes (86). And, according to Sontag, not all narratives are more effective (or affecting) than photographs: she uses Homer’s epic poem the Iliad as an example of a war narrative that depicts battle in a steely, unfeeling fashion. In the Iliad, Sontag asserts, “War is seen as something men do, inveterately, undeterred by the accumulation of suffering it inflicts” (93). Like the two types of war photography, staged and un-staged, Sontag presents two families of war narratives: those that, like the Iliad, depict war in a glorified, unrealistic manner, and those that dutifully report the violence of battle to mobilize readers to oppose war. She designates only the latter category as one that can have a powerful, lasting effect on the reader.\n\nBut not all war narratives belong to these two categories. Upon closer inspection of a collection of war narratives—“The Charge of the Light Brigade” by Alfred Lord Tennyson, The Things They Carried by Tim O’Brien, and the Iliad, by Homer—it becomes clear that the narrative’s place in the pantheon of war depictions is as varied as the photographs Sontag presents. And while readers cannot interpret a narrative as disparately as the Serbs and Croats interpreted the photo of the dead children, the strength of the audience’s response can vary widely based on the identity of the reader. But what do these narratives really do for us? What is their purpose if, as Sontag argues, they can’t ever really put us in the soldier’s boots?\n\nIt is an undeniable fact that certain war narratives glorify rather than accurately reflect the realities of war. Alfred Lord Tennyson’s “The Charge of the Light Brigade” is one such poem. It memorializes a particularly bloody battle during the Crimean War, in which six-hundred British soldiers were ambushed on the plain above Balaklava, a town in Crimea. Tennyson’s description of the men marching en masse to defend their country depicts a grand, cinematic version of the battle. He writes: “When can their glory fade?/ O the wild charge they made!/ … /‘Charge for the guns!’ he said:/ Into the valley of death/ rode the six hundred” (1). Tennyson’s poem paints the soldiers riding “into the valley of death” as glorious men nobly sacrificing their lives.\n\nThis line from Tennyson’s poem became the title for one of Roger Fenton’s most famous photographs of the Crimean War, entitled “Into the Valley of Death.” In the photograph, which Sontag discusses in her essay, Fenton captures a wide, rutted road that holds the remnants of the bloody battle, littered with cannonballs and rocks. In stark contrast to most of Fenton’s distinctly staged photographs, Sontag describes this image as a portrait “of absence, without the dead” (92). She explains that this portrait is the only one that would not have needed to be staged—it displays no more, and no less, than a void:\n\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-344" title="E3_Halperin_clip_image003" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/E3_Halperin_clip_image003.gif" alt="" width="378" height="244" />\n“Into the Valley of Death,” by Roger Fenton\n\nTennyson’s poem, on the other hand, is characterized not by absence, but rather by the presence of six-hundred soldiers marching to their deaths. He evokes the same panorama of destruction that Fenton’s photo memorializes, but in a more melodious fashion. While Fenton’s photograph captures the results of the destruction—the emptiness, the lost lives, the cannonballs—Tennyson’s poem depicts the march to destruction, and the battle itself: “Cannon to the right of them/ Cannon to the left of them/ Cannon in front of them/ Volley’d and thunder’d” (1). The rhyme and meter of the poem make it lyrical, which presents a strange contrast with the dark subject of the poem. It is interesting that Fenton would chose such a contrived, heavy-handed poem to entitle a photograph that is considered (at least by Sontag) to be one of the few emotionally affecting portraits of his career. Indeed, after reading the flowery poem, one would think that it belongs to Sontag’s first category of war narratives: the glorified, unrealistic depiction of war.\n\nThe fact that Fenton used a line from Tennyson’s poem to title his photograph, however, means that the poem did hold some significance at the time (if only for the artist himself). Although a contemporary audience might read the poem as a tired, flat memorial, when it was first published in 1854, readers felt it was a fitting tribute to the lost troops. Indeed, Tennyson wrote “Charge of the Light Brigade” immediately after reading an account of the battle in the paper. The poem became extremely popular, and was even distributed in pamphlets among the troops in Crimea (Shannon, 22). Despite what Sontag might think, it seems war narrative is not exclusively useful to provoke impassioned opposition. With careful word choice and elegiac form, narrative can also become a fitting memorial. Tennyson’s poem shows us that war narrative, like war photography, is an art whose meaning constantly shifts and changes with time and audience.\n\nIt is clear that war narrative is not merely, as Sontag suggests, useful as a rallying cry; it can also be a requiem for lost troops. This incarnation of war narrative must understandably distort the event it elegizes, because it is written to honor and flatter the soldiers who died. (Tennyson even changed the name of the squadron from “the Light Calvary Brigade” to “the Light Brigade” to make it more compact and rhythmic (Shannon, 13).) But while this kind of war narrative challenges Sontag’s view of the optimum purpose of a war narrative—to provoke outrage—it unwittingly supports her view of the abiding efficacy (or lack thereof) of these kinds of presentations of war. In glorifying these events, we in no way gain a sense of what it must actually have been like to be there. The line “Honor the brave and bold!/ Long shall the tale be told” (Tennyson 1) isn’t so much a glimpse into a battleground as much as it is a eulogy. Like Fenton, who often distorted the landscape in order to take a powerful photograph, Tennyson romanticizes and elegizes the famous Crimean battle to achieve his ends. But what if a writer’s aim is to achieve what Sontag believes is impossible—to capture, for a reader who has never been in a war zone, what the world under fire is like?\n\nTim O’Brien attempts this very feat in his collection of short stories, The Things They Carried, about a platoon of soldiers in the Vietnam War. The stories, told from the perspective of a narrator also named Tim O’Brien, describe the earth-shattering and bizarre life in a war zone and provide glimpses into the broken lives of the soldiers who survived the war. In “Good Form,” O’Brien distinguishes between “story-truth” and “happening-truth.” A “story truth” may not have technically occurred exactly as it is described, but is more faithful to the overall experience than a “happening truth,” which occurred in objective reality. He explains: “I want you to feel what I felt. I want you to know why story-truth is truer sometimes than happening-truth” (179). Both Tennyson and O’Brien distort the objective truth in their depictions of war, but for different reasons: Tennyson, to honor the lost soldiers, and O’Brien, to honor what he believes to be the essence of his experience.\n\nIndeed, O’Brien attempts to describe the turmoil going on inside of him by telling stories about the experience that caused it. O’Brien provides an example of a happening-truth: “I was once a soldier. There were many bodies, real bodies with real faces, but I was young then and I was afraid to look. And now, twenty years later, I’m left with faceless responsibility and faceless grief” (180). He juxtaposes this testimony with a story-truth: “He was a slim, dead, almost dainty young man of about twenty. He lay in the center of a red clay trail near the village of My Khe. His jaw was in his throat. His one eye was shut, the other eye was a star-shaped hole. I killed him” (180). With story-truth, O’Brien can give a face to the “faceless responsibility” and “faceless grief” he feels. Story-truth can, in O’Brien’s words, “make things present” (180). The nagging feeling in the pit of his stomach twenty years after the war is over can be realized on the page as a “slim, dead, almost dainty young man of about twenty.” Story truths, surprisingly more vivid than happening-truths, do not contain happening truths’ uncertainty of things unseen. They give faces, names, and places to tenebrous memories.\n\nStory-truths depict war very differently from a staged or a candid war photograph. These stories neither glorify war nor offer the methodical, painstakingly accurate depiction of violence that Sontag sites as a testimony to the power of narrative (98). Instead, O’Brien attempts to combine the control of a staged war photo with the emotional charge of a candid one. Sontag notes that the Vietnam War marked the end of staged war photography (93). It seems O’Brien inherited the legacy of the “lost art.” He renders his experiences as he thinks they should be seen, not as he saw them.\n\nO’Brien certainly challenges Sontag’s claim that it is impossible to give civilians a sense of what being in a war zone is actually like. But it is difficult, if not impossible, to determine whether or not he achieved his goal. Readers cannot go back in time and find themselves in the midst of battle to see if they would share O’Brien’s impressions. But O’Brien’s stories can be seen as an antidote to a particular problem Sontag has with war photography: “The problem…is that people remember only the photographs. This remembering through photographs eclipses other forms of understanding—and remembering” (Sontag 94). O’Brien’s stories enable a reader thinking about war to conjure up more than an out-of-context image. The reader can recall, as soldiers do, snippets of a larger story that are rooted in complex turmoil and emotion.\n\nBoth “The Charge of the Light Brigade” and The Things They Carried challenge Sontag’s limited definition of a war narrative and pose answers to the question of what a war narrative can do for the reader. It can not only provoke opposition, as Sontag argues, but also can act as a memorial, and even venture to give readers a sense of what war is like. But what about the works that Sontag dismisses as unrealistic depictions of war, like the Iliad? If we have found prose and poetry that challenge Sontag’s original characterizations of war narratives, might it be possible to see beyond Sontag’s confining definition of the Iliad as a depiction of war that is devoid of emotion?\n\nSontag argues that the Iliad callously presents war as a fact of life: “Descriptions of the exact fashion in which bodies are injured and killed in combat is a recurring climax in the stories told in the Iliad. War is seen as something men do, inveterately, undeterred by the accumulation of suffering it inflicts; to represent war in words or pictures requires a keen, unflinching detachment” (93). She explains that this view of war—as inveterate, inevitable, and even normal—is a product of the epoch in which Homer wrote the Iliad. She explains that, in stark contrast to contemporary belief that “war is an aberration,” the Iliad reflects a time at which “war has been the norm and peace the exception” (93). Homer’s world exists in a continual state of combat, and seems far removed from contemporary America, in which wars involve a select few instead of entire nations and empires. Indeed, the idea of battle as a way of life seems not only archaic but also unrealistic, considering the large number of war veterans suffering from severe Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. (Without even mentioning the ever-increasing number of Iraq War veterans suffering from the disease, a quarter-million of the three-quarters-of-a-million combat veterans from Vietnam are still living with severe PTSD [Shay, xix].) According to Sontag, the Iliad depicts war as ubiquitous, but this view of war is unrealistic, because war ravages a nation so thoroughly that the populace of a prosperous country could not maintain a perpetual state of war. Sontag sees the Iliad as a chronicle of a type warfare that does not, and cannot, resemble our own.\n\nBut some see the Iliad—the story of warrior Achilles’ anger in the Trojan War—not as an unrealistic depiction of war, but rather an extremely astute chronicle of a PTSD victim. Psychologist Jonathan Shay won a Macarthur Fellowship for his work treating PTSD in Vietnam War veterans using Homer’s the Iliad and the Odyssey. In the introduction to his book, Achilles in Vietnam: Combat Trauma and the Undoing of Character, he explains how that the story of the Iliad was actually similar to that of many Vietnam War veterans:\n\nAchilles…is tortured by guilt and the conviction that he should have died rather than his friend; he renounces all desire to return home alive; he goes berserk and commits atrocities against the living and the dead. This is the story of Achilles in the Iliad, not some metaphoric translation of it.\nThis was also the story of many combat veterans, both from Vietnam and from other long wars…I have brought them together with the Iliad not to tame, appropriate, or co-opt them but to promote a deeper understanding of both, increasing the reader’s capacity to be disturbed by the Iliad rather than softening the blow of the veterans’ stories. (Shay xxi)\n\nIn contrast to Sontag, Shay sees the Iliad not as an unflinching, unfeeling depiction of battle, but rather as an accurate chronicle of the emotional turmoil of a soldier in wartime. Reading the Iliad helped him better understand—and therefore, better treat—Vietnam War veterans. By adding that he hopes the juxtaposition of the soldiers’ stories with the Iliad will increase the readers’ sensitivity to the epic poem, Shay implies that the emotional potency of the poem might be hard for modern readers to access. This implication sheds new light on Sontag’s statement that the Iliad presents war as “inveterate” rather than exceptional or life shattering. It is possible that Sontag misread Homer’s dutiful descriptions of Achilles’ breakdown as detached, when they were, in fact, careful chronicles of a man losing his mind.\n\nIndeed, it seems hard to imagine that Sontag could read Homer’s description of Achilles’ treatment of his rival Hektor’s corpse as “unfeeling.” Blinded by grief and rage, Achilles violently abuses the body of Hektor, the Trojan general who murdered Achilles’ best friend Patroklos. The brutality of his actions is certainly vividly rendered, but the emotion behind it is apparent:\n\n…at that hour he [Achilles] yoked his team, with Hektor\ntied behind, to drag him out, three times\naround Patroklos’ tomb…Akhilleus\nin rage visited indignity on Hektor\nday after day.\n(Homer 24:16)\n\nThis description honors Achilles’ grief in the wake of his best friend’s death by revealing his inability to cope. Homer depicts Achilles dragging Hektor’s body around Patroklos’ tomb three times and abusing Hektor’s body “day after day.” As Shay points out, particularly traumatic events, such as betrayal by a leader, death of a friend in arms, or being wounded often leave a soldier at risk of entering a “berserk” state, one of unnecessary and uncontrolled violence. Shay characterizes Achilles—who has suffered all of these events—as “berserk” at this point in the poem.\n\nBut the berserk state is not exclusively a product of the Trojan War: a Vietnam veteran’s description of his own abuse of a dead victim, included in Shay’s book, could just as easily be read as Achilles’ internal monologue. He says: “I lost all my mercy. I felt a drastic change after that. I just couldn’t get enough. I built up such hate, I couldn’t do enough damage… [It] made some of the hurt go away” (78). It seems that Achilles is not merely a bloodthirsty warrior; like many soldiers, he is so overcome with emotion that he loses touch with the material world around him.\n\nParallels between Achilles’ narrative and O’Brien’s narrative further challenge Sontag’s characterization of the Iliad as an unfeeling report of the Trojan War. In “How to Tell a True War Story,” O’Brien describes his comrade Rat Kiley brutally murdering a baby water buffalo after the death of his best friend, Kurt Lemon. Like Achilles, and many war veterans Shay describes, Rat Kiley goes berserk in the wake of his best friend’s death. O’Brien describes the scene: “Rat took careful aim and shot off an ear….It wasn’t to kill; it was to hurt…[Rat] shot randomly, almost casually, quick little spurts in the belly and butt. Then he reloaded, squatted down, and shot it in the left front knee” (79). O’Brien, like Homer, describes with languishing detail the violent acts of soldiers in mourning. Both men brutally attack defenseless victims to displace the rage they feel in the wake of the loss of their best friend: Achilles abuses a corpse, and Rat, a baby buffalo. Both men also find it difficult to stop abusing the vulnerable victim. Interestingly, both soldiers’ desperate desire for control leads them to abuse defenseless victims. Their testimonies help us begin to comprehend how and why war crimes are committed. The close parallels between the two narratives also shed light on Homer’s epic. Like O’Brien, Homer so vividly describes his character’s horrifying actions to impress upon the reader how unhinged and nearly inhuman war can make a person. His poetry is not, as Sontag seems to think, a testament to the normalcy of war. Quite the contrary: in fact, it is intended to display the extent to which war can remove a solider from both morality and reality.\n\nThroughout her essay, Sontag looks exclusively at the way in which war photographs have affected viewers unconnected with war. It is not until the end of her essay that she ties in the view of the solider, stubbornly maintaining that the everyday civilian cannot understand what it’s like to be in a war zone. But war narratives do not only serve the non-soldier. Unlike photographs, which are taken largely to document events for those who are not present, narratives can be employed in therapy for war veterans. O’Brien explains how his own writings helped him deal with his war experiences: “The act of writing had led me through a swirl of memories that might otherwise have ended in paralysis or worse” (156). It seems that O’Brien’s embrace of “story-truth” is inextricably linked to the efficacy of his narratives. Through story truth, he explains, “I can attach faces to grief and love and pity and God…I can make myself feel again” (180). Sontag argues that war narratives are incapable of making us feel what war is like. But she leaves out the fact that war narratives can allow soldiers, hardened and withdrawn after the ravages of violence, to feel (something, anything) again.\n\nIn his descriptions of his own writing, O’Brien links his ability to remember with his ability to feel again. And O’Brien is not the only war veteran who had difficulty accessing not only emotions but also memories. Amnesia is common in the wake of traumatic events (Shay 172). And as Shay explains, narrative plays a substantial role in the healing (and re-remembering) process for war veterans: “Virtually all treatment methods direct the survivor to construct a personal narrative at some time in his or her recovery” (187). Shay explains that the construction of narrative is often difficult for veterans because sequential time is antithetical to the disorienting experience of battle. His description of the individual fragments that compose a trauma narrative recalls O’Brien’s description of “story-truth”:\n\nWe see the paradox that narrative temporality can never be completely true to the timeless experience of prolonged, severe trauma…The paradox disappears when we look at narration as a step in the survivor’s larger move to communalize the trauma by inducing others who were not there to feel what the victim felt when he or she was going through it (Shay 191).\n\nShay connects the two different audiences of war narrative — those who were there, and say we could never understand, and those who want nothing more than to understand. It seems the two parties are inextricably linked. In order to truly recover, a soldier must relay his experiences to a sympathetic audience. Depictions of war, then, can serve at least two audiences: those on the home front and those behind enemy lines. It also seems that war narratives can serve multiple purposes: they can memorialize and elegize soldiers; they can open one’s eyes to the horror of war; and they can also allow those who know war all too well to close their eyes and move on with their lives.\n\nWhen Sontag claims that depictions of war are in some way futile because we—those who have never seen war—just “couldn’t get it,” she seems to have missed the point. As Tennyson’s poem displays, war narratives are not exclusively written to provide an accurate account of a battle. In fact, “accuracy” in war narrative is barely relevant at all. Shay displays that the writer’s ability to capture war with emotional acuity, as O’Brien and Homer do, is what enables the soldier and the civilian to better understand each other. The soldier remembers how to feel, and the civilian gains some semblance of understanding the soldier’s experiences. The war photograph gives the viewer a false sense of certainty; having seen a photograph, we are bound to think we have a sense of the milieu the image captures. The war narrative, at its most effective, has the opposite effect. It shows the reader just enough of the horrors of war to make him or her understand what soldiers must wrestle with daily—the utter incomprehensibility of it all. \n\nHomer. The Odyssey.

Off the newly evacuated floors of Penn Station emerges a couple in their eighties, inching their way towards the tall information man standing to my right. The old man sports a freshly bought baseball cap with a crisp brim and an emblem that I do not recognize. It sits awkwardly on his head, too much space left at the top. I know that he has never worn a hat before.\n\nFinally, the couple reaches the information man, and the husband takes a step forward, looking back at his wife a few times for reassurance. No words are spoken. All that I hear is the annoying static coming from the walkie-talkie attached to the information man’s waist. The old man continues to look back and forth from his wife to the intimidating stranger in front of him. I wait for a line of encouragement from the information man, a simple “Can I help you?” to relieve the obvious difficulty of this encounter. I grow angry at his unnecessary exertion of the little authority he has. The silence is eventually broken when the old man takes out his ticket, and pointing to it, says in broken English (it sounds like he is Hispanic),\n\n“I want to take this to Secaucus.”\n\n“Track 6,” says the information guard. This is his favorite terse reply.\n\nThe old man looks down at his ticket, “I also wanted…” but the information man has already turned his back, ignoring the request. We wait in vain for him to turn around. Defeated, the old man turns back to his wife. She motions a “Well? Go on…” gesture, the kind that mothers make when their sons are too scared to pay for candy at the register on their own. Gathering up what is left of his confidence, the old man speaks thickly to the information man’s back: “Where is track 6?” The information man turns around, and heaving a sigh of aggravation, points in the direction of the track. “Thank you,” the old man nods excessively and walks towards the gate with his wife.\n\nI look back at the information man, who now shifts the weight back and forth from his heels to the balls of his feet. I try to detect any sign of remorse, but my attempts are futile, and soon I am wracked with a new preoccupation. I have always been aware of the diversity that makes up New York, and I had always believed that there was something about being a New Yorker that bridged the differences between diverse groups. But as I reflected on the way in which the information man purposely created distance between himself and the old Hispanic man, I began to see a different reality: perhaps New Yorkers create division between groups and establish an “other” (a person or group that opposes a certain ideal) as a tool of successful living. But what is in the nature of “otherness” and in the nature of New York and its citizens that calls for this division? And what are the consequences, for both society and the individual, of acknowledging “otherness”?\n\nMy wishes for the interaction between these two men may very well seem overly romantic for what was just a momentary encounter in Penn Station. But I cannot help but think that my longing for contact is a natural feeling in this enormous and often cold city. In her essay “The Use of Sidewalks: Contact,” Jane Jacobs recognizes city dwellers'' “wishes for differing degrees of contact” as a catalyst for the social interactions among them (77-78). She asserts that the best kind of public contact arises in public settings, (sidewalks, for example), and emphasizes the futility and danger of attempting to achieve public contact through private interaction: “ ‘Togetherness’ is a fittingly nauseating name for an old ideal in planning theory…The requirement that much shall be shared drives city people apart” (Jacobs 81). Jacobs’s disdain for private contact in the public sphere is highlighted through her example of a street in Baltimore that has no sidewalk public life and instead uses a sidewalk park as a primary location for private contact:\n<blockquote>Still more distressing, when mothers of different income or color or educational background bring their children to the street park, they and their children are rudely and pointedly ostracized. They fit awkwardly into the suburbanlike sharing of private lives that has grown in default of city sidewalk life. The park lacks benches purposely; the “togetherness” people ruled them out because they might be interpreted as an invitation to people who cannot fit in. (Jacobs 83)</blockquote>\nThe words “rudely,” “pointedly,” and “ostracized” transform what might have been perceived as a mere distaste for “togetherness” into an unsettling representation of the discrimination that can arise out of this ideal. Jacobs''s representation of the benchless park emphasizes the thick irony of the exclusive “togetherness” of this Baltimore street. She senses the phoniness of this planned utopia, the manner in which by choosing to exclude members from its inclusive neighborhood, the inhabitants of these residences are in essence cheating, making the process of togetherness easier by avoiding the inherent difficulty of co-existence. By establishing the “other,” and making their inclusiveness exclusive, the residents achieve a powerful sense of belonging.\n\nAs I imagine this mother wheeling a stroller into the park, her clothes, her voice, her hair and her make-up a stark contrast to the park’s everyday visitors, I am reminded of the old-Hispanic man with his broken English and too-new hat. I think of the “togetherness” people in the park, rudely complacent, and am reminded of the information man, who seemed to take advantage of the old man’s “otherness.” It is the old man and the visiting mother that give the information man and the Baltimore residents the identity they long for. As long as the former (out of place and visibly awkward) is present, the latter can exert the little authority they have and celebrate their comfortable position of belonging. The suffering of the excluded “other” becomes a necessary component of the “togetherness” people’s contentment.\n\nLike Jacobs, Joan Didion finds that the employment of the “other” masks unpleasant truths by establishing clear-cut, opposing forces. Didion argues, however, that the dangers of this concealment go beyond divisiveness and discrimination. In her essay “Sentimental Journeys,” she carefully examines the “sentimental narratives” (faulty and manipulative representations of public conflicts) that serve to “personalize and obscure” the real problems at the source of the city’s disorder (Didion 275). Presenting the case of Trisha Meili, the “Central Park Jogger” who was raped in 1989, Didion argues that the success of the case’s narratives arose out of the personalized and contrasting representations of the victim and her alleged attackers. She presents various headlines of newspapers following the case, “Teen Wolfpack Beats and Rapes Wall Street Exec on Jogging Path. Wolf Pack’s Prey. Female Jogger Near Death After Savage Attack by Roving Gang” (Didion 255), depicting the press’ insensitive portrayal of a helpless victim and the ravenous animals that allegedly attacked her.\n\nIn the simple narratives that evolved, the jogger became the image of everything that was right in the city (the “well-brought-up virgin,” the ivy graduate, the Wall-Street executive). The accused “by contrast, were seen as incapable of appreciating these marginal distinctions, ignorant of both the norms and accoutrements of middle-class life” (Didion 272). For the narrative to capture the peoples’ attention, it was not enough that the victim was the embodiment of success in the city. There had to be an opposing force, a person or group that challenged that ideal, so that the narrative could be distilled into a simple problem of good vs. evil, easily accessible to the citizens of New York.\n\nTwo "opposing visions” emerged. One “was of a city systematically ruined, violated, raped by its underclass. The [other]…was of a city in which the powerless had been systematically ruined, violated, raped by the powerful” (Didion 300). In using the exact same adjectives Didion illustrates that both opposing visions are as narrow as the narratives that sparked them. The personalization in the case of the Central Park Jogger allowed these groups to simplify the issues of race into problems of ravenous wolves and their prey. In doing so they were able to not only mask the complexities of the case, but also the economic crisis that was wrenching the city. The establishment of the “other” allowed New Yorkers to avoid confronting the real problems at the source of the city’s disorder, turning their attention instead to concerns that already had a set vocabulary and a familiar narrative and could thus be easily manipulated into the uncomplicated subjects that they were willing to address.\n\nDidion’s concept of “sentimental narratives” is also reflected in James Baldwin’s “Notes of a Native Son,” a personal essay in which he paints with heart-wrenching detail his experience of growing up as an African-American in the 1940s. In his retelling of the incident that sparked the Harlem riots (a black soldier’s fight with a white policeman over a black woman that resulted in the shooting of the black soldier), Baldwin emphasizes that the story that spread throughout Harlem held little merit. He writes, “The facts were somewhat different—for example, the soldier had not been shot in the back, and was not dead, and the girl seems to have been as dubious a symbol of womanhood as her white counterpart in Georgia usually is” (Baldwin 110). This narrative, he suggests became a popular favorite among the inhabitants of Harlem because, “This invention expressed and corroborated their hates and fears so perfectly” (Baldwin 110). The similarity between the woman in Harlem and the Central Park Jogger moves beyond their common role of victim. Their glorified representations in their respective stories depict the “invention” that Baldwin offers as his own “sentimental narrative.” The personalization of the black woman as a chaste victim and the policeman as the “other”—and consequently the implicit distinction between black and white, good and evil—once again made the case into an accessible narrative for the silenced voice that had been waiting for a chance to speak. The story thus transformed into whatever the public wanted it to represent, the embodiment of the problems they were longing to address.\n\nBaldwin also emphasizes that the popularity of these narratives is largely due to their ability to obscure personal strife. The establishment of the other created an environment where hate could be expressed freely, and sorrow driven into obscurity: “I imagine that one of the reasons people cling to their hates so stubbornly is because they sense, once hate is gone, that they will be forced to deal with pain” (Baldwin 101). Like Didion, Baldwin illustrates how the narrative of the “other” allowed the people of Harlem to address their problems superficially, avoiding the internal pain that was at the root of their suffering. It was imagined, perhaps, that if the pain was simply ignored, or transferred into rage, it would begin to go away. Instead, the hate became a destructive force and served only to exacerbate the pain.\n\nDespite these apparent similarities, however, Baldwin speaks of “otherness” in a way that sounds very little like Didion. He writes about acknowledging “otherness” from the perspective of an “other” and thus brings new dimensions to the meaning of the word. When he walks down the street after his confrontational interaction with a waitress, he becomes overwhelmed by his awareness of the differences that separate him from those around him: “People were moving in every direction but it seemed to me, in that instant, that all of the people I could see, and many more than that, were moving toward me, against me, and that everyone was white. I remember how their faces gleamed” (Baldwin 95). This is not the same “otherness” illustrated in Penn Station, a Baltimore sidewalk park, or the headlines of New York City newspapers. The “others” that Baldwin sees are not ostracized because they are different together; they are the majority. Baldwin, by contrast, represents the minority. Everyone walks together and “against” him, as he stands alone. He thus shares in the otherness of the old Hispanic man in Penn Station, the alleged rapists, and the awkward mother standing defenseless before the “togetherness” group.\n\nBaldwin’s perspective raises a consciousness that is not found in any of the other essays. The duality of his identity, expressed using a poignant first-person narrative, brings an added intimacy to his writing and allows him to articulate a vivid and convincing illustration of the dangers and pain that accompany “otherness.” His writing exposes the conflict of a man deeply embedded in the subject he addresses, lacking the easy escape or comfortable distance that Jacobs, Didion, and I used to our advantage in our analysis of otherness. When I witnessed the episode in Penn Station, my pity emphasized the vast difference between the old-Hispanic man and myself. I could situate myself above him, looking down upon his personal struggle; take my acknowledgment of otherness and move on, perhaps forget about it in a couple hours and then revisit it later in writing. When Baldwin sees otherness in the white people that surround him, the results are far more consequential, for he sees the otherness that they see in him. The words “rage,” “anger,” “disease,” “poison,” and “hate” permeate his essay, rendering it with living emotion and urgency and conveying the almost incomprehensible burden of what it means to be the “other.” Baldwin’s writing thus exposes the true devastation that arises out of the creation of “otherness” in New York City.\n\nIt is thus the combinations of a large and indifferent city and its lonely inhabitants looking for belonging, overwhelmingly broad problems of race and economic crisis and fear of confrontation, and perhaps even a fear of the otherness that we see in ourselves that leads New Yorkers to establish a divide between themselves and the person or group that to them represents the “other.” In this vast and complicated metropolis it seems that the “other” has thrived in its ability to simultaneously include and exclude, reveal and obscure, for its multifaceted nature matches the multifaceted demands of the New York City citizens.', 'Acknowledging Otherness', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '294-autosave', '', '', '2012-04-04 16:39:49', '2012-04-04 16:39:49', '', 294, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?p=333', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Hundreds of dejected, dispirited, and deprived young adults, fearful and confused, trudge across a beautifully landscaped plaza…. University of Virginia professor Mark Edmundson describes scenes almost as bleak on his campus and in his classroom. Edmundson believes that the capitalistic American way has created a “culture of consumption” which has imbedded itself deep within students’ psyches, stifling their ambitions and limiting their ability to think and act in individual and passionate ways (3-4). Edmundson names television as the key culprit in instigating this “culture of consumption.” The hypnotic lure of MTV and Oprah keeps Americans inside the fortified walls of their home, physically isolated from the real world. Our culture has changed. It is now time to encourage students to find their own direction, enabling the truest use of one of our most intrinsic human abilities, choice.\r\n\r\nThough television plays a large role, it is not solely to blame for the university campus being overrun by a zombotic population of students. Brazilian educational reformist, Paulo Freire, utilizes his experiences to explicate and criticize what he calls the “banking concept” of education. Within this system data is “deposited” into the student’s mind by teachers in a way that does not demand critical reflection upon that knowledge. Students are not encouraged to explore, reflect, and apply the information presented, they are merely allowed to “receive, memorize, and repeat” (Freire, 72).\r\n\r\nVeteran teacher John Taylor Gatto spent thirty years negotiating his way through crossfire in Manhattan’s public school system. Gatto’s experience illuminates many similarities between our public school system and Freire’s depiction of the oppressive “banking” pedagogy. As Gatto demonstrates, our educational system expects peaceful, patient, and absorbent behavior from students. Students are denied the opportunity to learn through rigorous discussion, individual problem solving, and critical thinking (1 –3). Brilliant ideas and deeper understanding often come from passionate exchange. Unfortunately, passionate exchange often provides nothing more than a one-way ticket to the Principal’s office. With this threat looming over students’ heads, they quickly learn to play the part expected…lumps of clay waiting to be molded.\r\n\r\nBut what exactly are students being molded into? Gatto asserts that the American educational system is designed to limit development, encourage “mediocre intellects,” debilitate the creative spirit, and mediate the capacity for “appreciable leadership skills” (4). American culture is a capitalistic culture. Capitalism requires capital, and capital requires the two things Gatto believes our school systems were created to produce: “employees and consumers” (6). This method of controlling the masses, fueling the work force, and creating a society more susceptible to consumption ultimately works to impede the development of young adults. Such debilitation leaves us with a school system that distributes high school diplomas to people who cannot even balance the checkbook that they are so often encouraged to use. It also creates a detached young culture that is vulnerably left to glean what life experience it can from the beguiling advertisements it is subjected to on television.\r\n\r\nMany present day college students are too young, too naïve, and too confused for college. It is not hard to believe Mark Edmundson’s claim that universities are filled with a one-dimensional passionless crop of students. One-dimension is all these young adults know. Observation is the only level of consciousness they have been allowed to achieve. Listen to the teacher and memorize what he has to say. Watch the television, and it will show you how society works. The mechanical distribution of classroom information in conjunction with the television at home has denied students the opportunity to step beyond observation and take action. Edmundson states, “The TV medium is inhospitable to inspiration, improvisation, failures, slipups. All must run perfectly” (3). However, living a life beyond observation—living an independent life with responsibilities to fulfill, decisions to make, and no one to blame or credit but yourself—will show you that inspiration, improvisation, failures, and slipups are integral, and often the most rewarding elements of life. Without inspiration there would be no art. Without improvisation there would be no surprise. Without failures there would be no heartache. Without slipups, there are few reality checks to encourage us to look at ourselves in a more levelheaded way. To deny these elements is to deny truly living life.\r\n\r\nThese are not things that can be “deposited” in the classroom, and they are not things that can be demonstrated while lounging on the living room sofa watching re-runs of Friends. Only truly experiencing life can answer such questions. This being the case, why are young adults not encouraged to live their own life and grasp a more firm hold on their wants and needs before they are sent to universities? Universities, where thousands of dollars are spent to prepare students for what they know nothing about; therefore cannot truly understand. Or more importantly, respect.\r\n\r\nDavid Denby, film critic for <em>The New Yorker</em>, writes about his experience of returning to Columbia after years of writing professionally and raising a family. Denby’s perspective is different the second time around. Living life has allowed an alternative through which he can interpret and understand the core curriculum that years before had left him apprehensive and disillusioned, yet not knowing why. This new perspective also has allowed Denby to see more clearly the state in which young students arrive in universities. Denby recounts the exhausting efforts made by Professor Edward Tayler as he struggled to move his students away from the “banking” method of education and encourage participation in the classroom. Tayler had to “trick” or “con” his students into contributing their thoughts and opinions to discussions (44). Denby describes these students as being confused. The pressures of society have hastily placed these young adults in an atmosphere that is contrary to the one they have been accustomed to. Their safe mechanical world, largely created by the educational system and consumerism, has been turned upside down and they have little independent life experience in which they can ground themselves. Denby recaps Tayler lecturing on “The Hermeneutic Circle.” This model asserts that words are merely words if you are not able to step back, and place them within a context. Yet there would be no context if there were no words. Both must work together if one is to truly understand a piece of literature. This method is not only critical to employ while reading; it is also critical in life (32). If there is no greater understanding of the world at large, there will be no true understanding for the reasons of data given in the classroom. The reverse is also true. The classroom and the world at large should work together in helping one understand how to lead a fulfilled life.\r\n\r\nYoung adults should not be rushed into college so quickly. Students straight out of high school, never having had the opportunity to experience life, frequently fail to break from the “banking” mentality. As I walk around my college campus I overhear students complaining about assignments they have been given. <em>This professor is so horrible! This assignment is completely unnecessary. I will never use this in life!</em> I want to scream, yes, you will! Perhaps the memory of specific content learned in the college classroom will fade, but the context in which you learn, the questions you have to raise, and the decisions you are encouraged to make are extremely beneficial lessons. The pressures of society push many young adults along, never allowing them the opportunity to come upon this realization.\r\n\r\nSix years ago, I was a dejected, dispirited, and deprived young adult trudging across a college campus complaining about the useless load of crap teachers felt the need to dump on me. I could not see the overarching importance—or the use—of knowledge I could gain from college. Throughout my life I was told what and how to think. I had not read any books or essays by Paulo Freire, or John Taylor Gatto, but I could have written pages about the “banking” method of education and the boredom and lifelessness it creates. I had not read an essay by Mark Edmundson. However, I was disturbed by the uniformity and lack of ambition in myself and in my peers. Public schools and the television did not provide me an opportunity to learn who I truly was or what I wanted. Instead I experienced the debilitation of the spirit and the limited development that John Taylor Gatto accuses the educational system of intentionally producing. I was miserable, confused, and angry. I needed something real. Faster than you could say college dropout, my bags were packed, and I was on my way to the most “real” place I could think of: New York City.\r\n\r\nIt was not until then that I started to live my life on my terms. I learned the importance of independence and individuality. The struggle, pleasure, and confusion that accompany adult responsibilities allowed me to begin the process of learning who I was, what I enjoyed, and what goals I wanted to achieve. However, after working and traveling for a few years I felt that there was still something missing. I needed more. I slowly began to realize that my mind was craving academic knowledge. This realization inspired an unexplainable and intense passion. In order to achieve my personal and professional goals I needed to be what John Taylor Gatto claimed capitalism feared most: an educated, independent, and creative thinker. For the first time I began to feel as though that useless load of crap did not have to be so useless. I was not clear exactly how, but I knew there was someway that I could utilize my life experience and make my education work for me. I had a passion to liberate myself by stepping beyond the state of observation and reaction that had been encouraged throughout my life and to take action.\r\n\r\nIt was time to walk across that campus once more. I knew the importance and weight of my decision, and that allowed me to bring something that was impossible to possess as an eighteen year old straight out of high school—Respect. I brought an immeasurable amount of respect for the knowledge I could gain, ways in which this knowledge could be of use, and the opportunities it could illuminate. My life experience created a deep passion. It was this passion that gave me a good reason to write those checks for over $20,000 a year in tuition.\r\n\r\nRational thought suggests that the media will not loosen its tight grip around the reins driving popular culture. It is unlikely that the educational system will change either; it seems to accomplish precisely what it what was created to accomplish. I do not claim to hold the key that would resolve the problems in our failing educational system. I do not know how to reverse the effects of consumerism. The only thing I claim to know is the importance of living your own life, and doing so at your own pace. No person should be pressured or forced to engage in what they do not understand. With that in mind I offer this to any miserable, confused, or angry young student: Live life, experience the world, find yourself, and do not decide what direction to continue until you can truly respect what will come from this choice.

Presently, individual prisons in America earn millions of dollars from the sale of goods produced by inmates (Wisely). According to an article published by the Center For Research On Globalization:In his essay "Prison Labor, Slavery &amp; Capitalism In Historical Perspective," Stephen Hartnett cites the testimony of Shaka, an inmate who refuses to participate in prison labor because he equates it with slave labor, stating that "during slavery, work was understood to be a punishment, and became despised as any punishment is despised. Work became hated as does any activity which accomplishes no reward for the doer.… I unequivocally refuse to be a slave." While Shaka''s equation of contemporary American prison labor to slavery may seem hyperbolic, his testimony, nevertheless, raises questions about the meaning and the principles behind contemporary American prison labor programs. Today, there are two dominant perspectives on convict labor. The first states that penal work programs are rehabilitative; they prepare the convict to be a functioning individual in society at large. The second reflects Shaka''s argument: that prison labor is exploitation on the level of slavery.\n<blockquote>The federal prison industry produces 100% of all military helmets, ammunition, belts, bullet proof vests, ID tags, shirts, pants, tents, bags, and canteens... 98% of the entire market for equipment assembly services; 93% of paints and paintbrushes; 92% of stove assembly; 46% of body armor; 36% of home appliances; 30% of headphones/microphones/speakers; and 21% of office furniture. (Pelaez)</blockquote>\nThese numbers are striking. Prison labor clearly comprises an important portion of America''s economy, yet prisoners are typically paid either minimum wage or well beneath it. Many state prisons deduct costs of living from these wages so that inmates may earn only 20 or 60 cents an hour (Pelaez). Is this exploitation? As a nation that supports the fair treatment of all laboring citizens, it is important to ask whether or not America is profiting from a system that is unjust and cruel. Does prison labor exploit or reform the convict? Are contemporary American prisoners working for their own benefit or are they, as Shaka so passionately claims, slaves to the prison system?\n\nAmerican policy has always maintained that prison labor is rehabilitative, that it works to reintegrate the criminal into society through useful work and participation in the economy of the outside world. In 1816 the Auburn Prison was opened in the state of New York, operating under a philosophy of reforming prisoners through precise, communal work environments and solitary confinement rather than capital punishment and torture ("Auburn Prison Model"). Prisons built in the Auburn model began to spring up all over America. For a long period in the nineteenth century, prison labor was the rule at Rhode Island State Prison, which had their inmates craft shoes, "manufacture stained and grained furniture," and meet quotas (Garman 123). This enforced work environment supposedly was designed for "reordering dysfunctional lives" (Garman 120). The inmate was seen as possessing a "dysfunction" and labor programs provided the means of reforming criminals—rewiring their circuitry to be functioning individuals in society.\n\nThe U.S. Prison Industries Reorganization Administration''s 1937 study, "The Prison Labor Problem in California," praised road work as an effective rehabilitative method:\n<blockquote>Under these freer surroundings... where discipline is maintained on an honor basis and all men are engaged in hard work to maintain themselves and provide something for dependents and their own eventual release, where rest and occasional holidays mean something else than just another dreary day, prisoners are preparing themselves physically, mentally and morally for the responsibilities of normal living on the outside.</blockquote>\nThis passage lucidly expresses the historical perspective on prison labor as rehabilitation: that labor subverts the punishing quality of prison by releasing inmates from absolute containment. Labor, thus, "prepares" prisoners for "normal living on the outside" by allowing them a rehearsal space to practice certain liberties. In addition, the passage suggests that prison labor affirms the importance of responsibility. If prisoners are to enjoy "rest and occasional holidays," they must adhere to "an honor basis" and must be "engaged in hard work to maintain themselves." Prison labor potentially instills in criminals the causality essential to outside living: if you are going to enjoy freedom, you have to do useful work to maintain it.\n\nMany contemporary sociologists would agree with the 1937 study''s claim that prison labor is less like slavery and more like liberty, or at least, like a rehearsal space for free living. Robert D. Atkinson, for example, explains that many prisoners "volunteer for work, because it is a lot … more rewarding than watching TV all day." Atkinson might respond to Shaka''s assessment of prison labor as slavery by arguing that no one is forcing the prisoners to do anything; prisoners willingly participate in work to escape the monotonous boundaries of the prison system. Convict labor thus resembles work on the outside because it is voluntary and even earns prisoners a salary.\n\nContemporary proponents of prison work programs also echo the historical perspective that prison labor provides inmates with useful work skills. Atkinson claims that "prison labor looks like normal labor; workers sewing garments, building furniture, recycling computers, answering phones, etc." Former Supreme Court Justice Warren E. Burger agrees that "if we place these inmates in factories, making ball-point pens, hosiery, cases for watches, parts for automobiles, lawn mowers, computers, or other machinery … we will stand a better chance to release from prison persons able to secure gainful employment" (755). Rehabilitating a criminal partly depends on teaching the prisoner skills to be applied in the outside world, and proponents argue that prison labor achieves this objective.\n\nIn fact, advocates of prison labor argue that it provides more than just physical work skills. Sociologist Gordon Hawkins supports prison work programs because work is "a major source of status and of a sense of adult independence." He argues that, without labor in prisons, prisoners become idle and dependent on others (87), hardly behavior that will support them on the outside. Hawkins seems to suggest that labor programs help to mature the criminal mind – to settle a childish "dependence on others" (87), and to instill the pride and self-reliance necessary to life on the outside. Hawkins perceives work as a right of passage, and a means of achieving important character qualities for free living. So, through prison labor, good qualities are learned as well as useful skills.\n\nAll of these rehabilitative qualities of prison labor are said to effect recidivism rates. Furthermore, many prisons contend that work programs help to reintegrate the prisoner into his surrounding environment, even while contained. A <em>USA Today</em> article explores a prison work program in Maryland that produces office supplies with strange state pride: "the list ... reads like a Maryland geography lesson: Silver Spring, Chesapeake, Potomac, New Windsor, etc." (Dishneau). The fact that the products cannot be sold out of state in part justifies these names, but perhaps these state-pride products also attempt to reintegrate the prisoner into his outside environment. By crafting products specific to the location that they inhabit, prisoners may come to feel as if they have an economic stake in the surrounding communities, a 42.8 million dollar stake in the case of Maryland (Dishneau).\n\nOf course, none of these arguments for rehabilitation would be compelling enough without evidence that prison labor helps inmates re-enter society. The executive director of Maryland Correctional Enterprises claims that "inmates who work in the plants tend to re-offend and return to prison at about half the rate of those who don''t" (Dishneau). Other prisons have claimed a similar recidivism rate due, seemingly, to the prison labor programs (Atkinson). Once again, it appears, from data at least, that prisoners have been reintegrated successfully into the outside world through the work of labor programs. In summation, the concept of labor as rehabilitation relies on the assumption that labor helps to reintegrate convicts back into society insofar as the labor is voluntary, teaches useful work skills, and constitutes the convicts'' presence in the local state economy.\n\nSo how can Shaka, as well as others, reasonably claim that prison labor equates to slave labor when the benefits seem so obvious? To begin, they dispute that prison labor is voluntary, and therefore equate it to slave labor. Matthew Parker, a Columbia University graduate and writer who served approximately 11 years in and out of state prisons in Arizona, dispels the notion that work is wholly voluntary: "In a medium security prison, everybody''s gonna work. Otherwise they''ll just increase security and throw you in ''max.'' Everybody works." Parker points to the complex power system at play that "inspires" so-called voluntary labor amongst inmates. In addition to avoiding increased security, there are other incentives for prison labor, including decreased sentences, and better treatment by guards (Erlich). Work is not, under these circumstances, a voluntary act, participated in to obtain a salary. In Parker''s assessment, prison labor does not transcend the walls of the penal complex by substituting for the kind of voluntary work available on the outside, but rather remains nested in the complex web of forces that comprise a prison.\n\nSo, if not exactly voluntary, does prison labor not redeem itself by giving prisoners "a better chance … to secure gainful employment" by teaching them useful skills (Burger 755)? In Reese Erlich''s article "Prison Labor: Workin'' For The Man," an inmate from the California prison system named Dino Navarette speaks out about his experience with prison labor: "They put you on a machine and expect you to put out for them… Nobody wants to do that. These jobs are jokes to most inmates here." This particular inmate considers prison labor menial and unwanted; he claims that the jobs have no value for prisoners besides the possibility of a shorter sentence. From his perspective, the work has no real substance in granting the prisoners useful skills, but is only another force of opposition to be endured by convicts. In fact, many prison labor programs do not even pretend to grant prisoners useful work skills. Matthew Parker describes a specific job assignment in the Arizona State Prison called the "rock crew," which consisted of moving rocks from one side of the yard to the other. This job seems absurd in its misuse of prisoners'' time and energy. Moving rocks hardly seems like an activity designed to help employ convicts upon reentry. Indeed, many of the jobs in prison labor programs are simply there to make inmates work.\n\nEven to those prisoners who are actually learning useful skills, the reintegration process can be daunting. An article by David R. Jones in the <em>Gotham Gazette</em> claimed that some states uphold policies that bar ex-convicts from obtaining licenses for skills they learned in prison. He cites the story of a New York State prisoner who applied for a barber''s license but was denied because "owing to state law, La Cloche could only practice his trade … if he remained behind bars." The skills La Cloche learned had been confined by policy. This particular policy, practiced by many states in America, renders any skill gained from prison labor useless on the outside, therefore undermining the rehabilitative quality of prison labor.\n\nMoreover, securing a job is no easy task for an ex-con, even without such policies. A report published for the Urban Institute Reentry Roundtable claims that even when ex-convicts possess some job training "most employers are reluctant to hire those with such records" (Holzer et al. 8). This reluctance among employers on the outside may come from legal restrictions in federal law, fear of litigation, and even employer attitudes towards "ex-offender status" (7). In short, employers fear and mistrust ex-convicts—they fear that they may be negligent in their work, that they will steal, but mostly, that they bear a mark of ignominy as a criminal. Even with effective job training attained from labor in prison, reintegration is difficult when you bear the title of convict.\n\nReentry for any convict is a trying process. Although many prisons boast that work programs decrease the chances of a prisoner reoffending, it seems an oversimplification to claim statistics about decreased recidivism are directly related to prison labor programs. Prison reentry policy is "geared to fail," says Parker. "They want you to work at McDonalds. That''s why they won''t let you drive. The only way to get to a construction site after you get out of prison is to drive, but on parole you can''t do even that." Indeed, Parker''s feeling of containment lasted long after he was released from prison. Despite proclaimed reduction in recidivism rates due to prison labor programs, Parker insists that he did not benefit from prison labor once released. Rather, he and others former prisoners are confronted with the same barriers and walls they endured while detained, making any chance at reentry difficult, if not impossible.\n\nSo maybe prison labor does not supply inmates with useful work skills that will apply to the outside, but one might still argue that the very function of prison industries support the convict''s reintegration into local economies. Maryland prison systems sell hand-crafted furniture to local businesses and prisoners are paid wages, although limited, for their services. Does not prison labor reflect the work process that normal people go through on the outside? Doesn''t prison labor, as Robert D. Atkinson claims, "look like normal labor?"\n\nTo assume that the inmate is an actual participant in the economy at large is rendered absurd by several circumstances. Dino Navarette articulates his frustration with the fact that California has been exporting prison-made goods: "''You might just as well call this slave labor, then'', says Navarette. ''If they''re selling it overseas, you know they''re making money. Where''s the money going to? It ain''t going to us''" (Erlich). Navarette''s consternation with low wages and his suspicion of exploitation is shared in prisons where exporting goods is not practiced. We have already heard from Shaka, who "unequivocally refuse[s] to be a slave." It is difficult for either Navarette or Shaka to imagine that they are participating in the economy of the outside world. Rather, they both feel shackled by their society rather than associated with it. The minimal wages that they are paid are only a painful reminder that they are being punished and someone else is profiting from their toil.\n\nProfessor Gordon Lafer concurs that "prison labor is analogous to slave labor," but for a different reason. He states that "convict labor not only takes decently paid jobs out of the economy; it also undermines the living standards of those who remain employed by forcing their employers to compete with firms that use prisoners." Evidence of this competition is everywhere. The same <em>USA Today</em> article that discusses Maryland''s Prison Industry ends with a disturbing acknowledgment of how local businesses have to compete unfairly with the cheap cost of prison labor and their high profits (Dishneau). Lafer cites instances in which "a south Georgia recycling plant laid off 50 workers … and replaced them with prison laborers…" and "in Eugene, the church-owned Sacred Heart Hospital canceled its contract with a unionized linen service and redirected the work to a prison laundry." What this competition highlights is the unusual economic nature of prison labor. Prison labor is generally cheaper and more profitable than any kind of legal, regulated industries on the outside. This makes prison work programs a target for opposition from companies, labor unions, and federal overseers. Therefore, prison labor is not typical labor. It incites opposition from the economic world on the outside, because prison labor does not fairly compete, and can do so because it exploits its workers.\n\nParadoxically, while prison work may be exploitative and not nearly as rehabilitative as its proponents claim, disposing entirely of prison labor might present its own dangers. While criticizing many of the functions of prison labor, Parker claims that prison work programs still serve an important purpose: maintaining sanity. "You''ll go crazy without working for a while. If I didn''t have a job in prison, I would''ve been climbing the [expletive] walls." Here is a seasoned ex-inmate, well acquainted with the prison labor system, advocating working in prison for its "therapeutic" purposes. Parker points to the basic human desire to work and be useful. Even with jobs as absurd as the "rock crew," prison labor offers inmates the chance to make use of their bodies in an environment that otherwise supports idleness. Parker may agree, therefore, with the arguments of Hawkins and Atkinson that prisoners labor to resist the paralyzing effects of containment.\n\nYet Parker claims that the merits of prison labor are utterly confined within the prison. While locked up, many inmates want to work – not to better themselves, not to learn useful skills, not even to participate in their local economy, but simply to work. Parker presents an honest assessment of prison labor. Work stimulates the detained body, but does it improve, reform, or rehabilitate the person inside it?\n\nFrom what we have examined so far, the answer can hardly be yes. And to assume that labor is rehabilitative is to support a rather disconcerting philosophy. First, return to Former Supreme Court Justice Warren E. Burger, who writes (as I have partly quoted before):\n<blockquote>Most prison inmates, by definition, are maladjusted people…. They do not observe the concepts of work and accountability that made this country great. They were not taught … the moral values that instill respect and concern for the rights of others and in turn foster self-respect. If we place these inmates in factories, making ballpoint pens, hosiery, cases for watches, parts for automobiles, lawnmowers, computers, or other machinery ... we will stand a better chance to release from prison persons able to secure gainful employment. These will be persons whose self-esteem has improved enough to afford a better chance of living a normal life. (755)</blockquote>\nJustice Berger combines the rhetoric of economically reconditioning the prisoner with the somewhat problematic rhetoric of redefining the<em> character</em> of the prisoner—of rewiring the criminal mind. Of course, it would be best if we had less "maladjusted" people in society, but Berger''s rhetoric remains troubling. It seems as if he is diagnosing the general social disease that persists among prisoners and prescribing labor as a means of eradicating that disease. In essence, he claims that prison labor gains authority over the character of individual convicts. Ultimately, the process of "making ballpoint pens, hosiery, cases for watches" etc. becomes a means of molding the human being. Prison labor, when considered rehabilitative, becomes an exercise of power—a means of overriding the inmate''s will.\n\nThis is the argument of philosopher Michel Foucault, who, in his assessment of modern punishment, claims that "if one intervenes upon [the body] to imprison it, or to make it work, it is in order to deprive the individual of a liberty that is regarded both as a right and as property…. From being an art of unbearable sensations punishment has become an economy of suspended rights" (11). Foucault places prison labor within his "economy of suspended rights," and claims that this economy''s object is ultimately "a punishment that acts in depth on the heart, the thoughts, the will, the inclinations" (16). What could be more salient to Foucault''s claims than the argument that prison labor is rehabilitative? Does not Burger claim that prison labor comes to have precedence over the values and the character of prisoners? Are not the arguments that work programs "reform" the inmate reliant on the idea that prison labor exercises control over the inmate''s person? Do we not assume that we can convert the prisoner by forcing him to work? By attempting rehabilitation through work, we use force to manipulate the soul.\n\nAt its best, prison labor may not hurt the prisoner. It may even provide, as Parker asserts, a therapeutic outlet. But let us not trick ourselves into thinking that prison labor performs a rehabilitative task. Prisoners go through the movements of crafting furniture, manning sewing machines, and printing license plates to satisfy their natural desires. If we assume that the purpose of prison labor is reintegration and reform, we uphold the idea that labor exercises absolute control over the body and the will—a philosophy that strikes at the very heart of the inmate.\n\nContemporary prison labor is not the black-and-white issue proponents or opponents of it may claim it to be. Prison labor is neither rehabilitation nor clear-cut slavery. If we continue to support prison labor as rehabilitation, we become disingenuous in assuming that such work effectively reforms the character of the prisoner and reintegrates him into society. If we discard the programs entirely, we may deny prisoners the outlet they need to prevent them from "climbing the [expletive] walls." Instead, we need to examine the idle environment of prisons and reform the conditions that make prison labor a necessary component. Our support should lie with programs that both stimulate the prisoner and rehabilitate him—such as education. For as long as we continue to view prison labor as effective rehabilitation, we ignore the severe policy errors which prevent real, meaningful reintegration, and favor a system that exercises power rather than one that fosters reform.', '"Work Don''t Hurt Me": A Study Of Prison Labor And Prison Industries In America', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '205-autosave', '', '', '2012-04-05 21:01:02', '2012-04-05 21:01:02', '', 205, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?p=336', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
(337, 8, '2012-03-23 15:51:44', '2012-03-23 15:51:44', 'Waiting to buy our groceries in the supermarket checkout line, occasionally we’ll glance at the rack of tabloids and wonder, who could possibly read these flagrant fabrications? Nevertheless, tabloids may be worth a closer look. In <em>Men In Black</em>, Tommy Lee Jones, Agent K, and Will Smith, Agent J, scour the tabloids for reports of extra-terrestrial activity, viewing these absurdities as “the best investigative journalism on the planet” (Men In Black). The American government and society in the film see supermarket tabloids as the purest form of unencumbered truth, where the most absurd conspiracies are blatant fact and the skeptics are merely in denial. This comic portrayal of a society with radically different values of journalistic validity hints at a presence of truth in tabloid journalism that is often brusquely dismissed. Though we are all aware of the lies and inventions presented in such tabloids as <em>The Weekly World News</em>, perhaps it is possible to uncover an element of truthful social commentary beneath the surface of their flagrant fabrications. By looking at the tabloids’ commentary on American politics and power, we can discern an allegory for current American values and concerns: one which provides a unique forum for contemporary societal frustrations.\n\nSince its birth as a refuge to individuals driven from their homelands by religious persecution, America has been a nation rich with symbolism of new beginnings and allegoric representations of important historic events. Defining allegory as the expression of truths or generalizations about human existence by means of symbolic fictional figures and actions, one can begin to recognize many such representations throughout American History. The way Americans interpret their own social, political, and economic condition through cultural allegory has evolved and developed from the idealism of colonial America to the cynicism of the modern era.\n\nDeborah L. Madson’s<em> Allegory in America </em>provides a fluid explanation of American allegory as it has evolved from colonialism to the postmodernist era, while also chronicling the transformation of American ideals and values. In the early stages of colonial settlement, Americans created allegories to represent the trials and hardship with which they were repeatedly assailed. Stemming from the idea of religion as the basis of the migration from Europe to the New World, the allegories adopted were generally Biblical (Madsen, 2). In particular, colonists related their experience to that of the “redeemed people [led by Moses] out of bondage in Egypt into the freedom of the Promised Land” (Madsen, 2). The colonists viewed their mission to develop “a citie upon a hill” as a religious calling to set an example for other nations of redemption and second chances (Madsen, 2). Thus, just as Moses led the persecuted Jews from Egypt, America became the new ‘Promised Land’, one of intense religious loyalty and opportunity. The Biblical allegory allowed colonists to explain the trials and challenges such as famine, Indian attack, and disease which they were experiencing. Colonists could justify their suffering as symbolic of God’s concern for their spiritual welfare, “a means of warning them of the dangers of complacency” (Madsen, 2). Consequently, the biblical allegory served to sanction colonial actions by reassuring colonists of the righteousness of their choices.\n\nInversely, the same allegory could be used as a rebellion against these very rationalizations. While the persecuted Jews were escaping unjust treatment from the Egyptians, the colonists were instilling similar abuses on the natives of the new land. Here, the reading of the allegory serves as a critique of the colonists for the hypocrisy of manipulating such an allegory to justify their own oppressive actions. The influence of the Exodus story on New World America, Madsen suggests, represents the tendency of allegories to propagate during times of cultural crisis as a means of encouraging continued strength. Yet, the many facets and elements of each allegorical tale lend it a flexibility, allowing it to represent not only the orthodox vision, in this case of America as the land of opportunity, but also “a voice to those who dissent from this vision, who use allegory only to reject what it has come to stand for” (Madsen, 5). Therefore, we see both the origination of allegorical tradition in American society as well as its propensity to create a paradox, a means of questioning its own values.\n\nA cultural crisis of today, from which an allegory might stem, lies in the lack of political stability stemming from conflicting opinions concerning presidential legitimacy and capability. Going into the Election of 2000, the country was starkly divided between support for the Democratic candidate, Al Gore, and the Republican candidate, George W. Bush. In fact, the election was so closely divided that President Bush was set into office without the backing of the popular vote, which made for one of the “messiest postelection [periods] in American history” (Cook, 652). An ABC News/ Washington Post Survey of 1,050 adults taken in late February, 2001 showed Bush’s popularity, 55% approval, to be the “lowest job-approval rating of any newly elected President in the past 50 years” (Cook, 652). Throughout Bush’s presidency, the country has seen a continuous seesaw of rising and falling support for the President’s actions.\n\nIn fact, a poll taken just prior to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, found President Bush’s approval rating had dipped to a low 51%, only to sky rocket after the attacks to an impressive 90%, before sinking once again to 57% by early March of the following year (Cook, 2507). Earlier this year, Richard Benedetto, a journalist for USA Today, found the President’s “score for honesty and trustworthiness [to be] at the lowest point of his presidency” (Benedetto, A. 07). Explanations for Bush’s rising and falling popularity inevitably stem from an immense polarity within the country, “the country remains evenly split, 50-50, between the two major parties” (Cook, 2507). A country so divided lends itself to allegorization, though not in such a conventional form as those of colonial times.\n\nRather, the specific allegory adopted during each moment of cultural crisis appears to reflect the popular culture and societal values of the given period. Just as the colonists of the New World created a Biblical allegory to the richness of their religious piety, we might expect to find our contemporary allegory veiled under the cover of American consumerism and materialism. In his commentary on the declining value of pure education in the university culture, Mark Edmundson notes that “university culture like American culture writ large is…ever more devoted to consumption and entertainment” (Edmundson, 2). Even Politics has become a matter of entertainment, as one might see in such politically-oriented talk shows as "Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher" and "The Daily Show with Jon Stewart." With immense efforts to draw voter attention and interest through entertaining and catchy campaigns, we have become “a country learning about one party’s potential nominees in a way that suggests it might be easier to learn about their platform had they taken out ads in <em>Daily Variety</em>” (Goodman, D.1). Goodman, a journalist for <em>The San Francisco Chronicle</em>, comments that the upcoming election is so entertainment-oriented that it appears to be “ignoring the real information and concentrating on poll results and personal high jinks” (Goodman, D.1). American society today depends on entertainment in all areas of knowledge acquisition, from university education to information about political campaigns. In this age of entertainment, it is no wonder that we might begin to discover our allegories of American political ideology in something as common and consumer-based as a supermarket tabloid.\n\nSupermarket tabloids overflow with entertainment, appearing to focus much more on amusing their readers then on passing on any important information. William Randolph Hearst, one of the pioneers of tabloid journalism, espoused a journalistic philosophy of “90% entertainment, 10% information - and the information without boring you” (Sloan, 25). Yet, considering the absent need for intellectualism in such reporting, tabloid journalists are not nearly as self-effacing and uneducated as one might expect. In order to improve the quality of their product in the early 1970s, tabloid publishers began to draw in the most esteemed journalists from respectable newspapers ranging from the<em> Los Angeles Times</em> to the <em>Fort Worth Press</em>. They accomplished this by promising a “fat pay raise” (Sloan, 14) which resulted in the <em>Enquirer</em> salaries being “the highest paid by any paper or magazine in the country” (Sloan, 14). Thus, with such well-regarded minds concocting stories, these tabloids should not be dismissed so quickly as being entirely without merit. One might wonder, with such respectable writers, whether tabloids have a more formative effect on their audience than we might previously have assumed.\n\nThe majority of tabloid readers are between the ages of 20 and 49, the voting public, creating a very effective audience for political commentary (“Trends in Newspaper Readership”). While expecting all of these readers to recognize the political commentary concealed in the tales woven by tabloid journalists, the reactions of readers to these stories certainly vary. The flexibility of tabloid journalism lies in its ability to be read in one of two ways: as serious, though fantastical, journalism, or as ridiculously absurd comedy. Those who choose to read tabloids in the former manner take its stories at face value, rarely questioning the truth of the news as reported. Those who employ the latter method might use tabloids as a lens to ridicule modern society. This dual function lends tabloid journalism the ability to create an effective modern allegory. Tabloids possess a subversive nature, a painstakingly hidden truth which, when discovered, can open the eyes of the reader to the hypocrisies of their own society.\n\nBetween the considerable experience and ability of tabloid journalists and the unknowingly susceptible audience, one can imagine that these journalists might be tempted to slip some political commentary into their stories. In fact, tabloid journalists of the 1970s, became “the first among their profession since World War II – at least in this country – to take a questioning, aggressive, often adversarial approach to government and other major forces that control our society” (Sloan, 15). Thus, thirty years ago, tabloid staff set a precedent of intelligent political commentary that appears to remain, though painstakingly hidden, even in the most sensationalized and unrealistic tabloids of today.\n\nThe search for political commentary in <em>The Weekly World News</em>, yields a fruitful article,“2-Headed Man for President – And Vice President,” which appears to be merely a comical fabrication, yet, with further scrutiny, serves as an allegory of current American political division. The article discusses the background and political platform of a fictional two-headed character, Peter Paul Prentice (One head being Peter, the other Paul), running for the presidency and vice presidency as an independent. By setting up the candidate as an independent, the journalist, Annie Van Horne, creates a foundation for a critical commentary on both democratic and republican ideals.\n\nThe article presents a valid political platform with qualities typical of the two prominently conflicting parties, the republicans and the democrats. Van Horne describes such espoused policies as balancing the budget and increasing military spending which, according to analysts, are typical of the republican party (Fineman, 38). She also describes what many call characteristically democratic policies, such as Medicare drug benefits to senior citizens and legalization of purchasing pharmaceuticals overseas (Alter, 22). We see further symbolism of the conflict between republicans and democrats in Prentice’s place of birth: Sarasota, Florida, one of the many counties in Florida which experienced a re-count after the confused elections of 2000. Thus, Van Horne sets the candidate up as an embodiment of both parties, thereby allowing us to see his two-headedness as a symbol of the conflict between the right and the left.\n\nYet, Peter Paul Prentice is not only referred to as “two-headed,” he is also termed “two-faced” (Van Horne, 6), indicating an element of hypocrisy among any single candidate or political party. This idea of hypocrisy serves as a common means of ammunition against one’s opponent. In the current election, republicans attack John Kerry for his hypocritical acceptance of campaign contributions from companies which he had previously condemned for their practice of sending their operations over seas to avoid U.S. taxes (Human Events, 6).\n\nSimilarly, in the elections of 2000, Bush was criticized for his hypocrisy when he promised to change the accusatory tone of modern presidential campaigns and then went on to cast “aspersions of Gore’s mistakes and exaggerations” (Safire, B.11). The<em> Weekly World News</em>’ Van Horne not only critiques the current political system through a disguised reference to hypocrisy, she also bluntly assails the vanity of the current president, professing that Peter Paul Prentice would expand education with the money that President Bush would have used for “pork barrel programs” such as “adding [his] bust to Mount Rushmore” (Van Horne, 6). Thus, through the use of fantastical characters and a fictional scenario, the<em> Weekly World News</em> creates an allegory which serves as a critique of the dishonesty, self-interest, and duality of the current political system.\n\nIn another addition of the <em>Weekly World News</em>, correspondent Miguel Figueora writes “Oil Discovered in Cuba--U.S. Troops Poised to Liberate Island Nation,” an article which subtly critiques the faults of the current presidency and the conservative ideology. The article discusses a fictional discovery of oil off the cost of Cuba, a discovery that, Figueora purports, will lead America to invade Cuba and overthrow Fidel Castro. The supposed oil in Cuba mirrors the situation that Bush faced in Iraq, thus serving as an allegory of the Iraq War. By touching on the motivations for which Bush was accused of going to war with Iraq, the article mocks American self-centeredness.\n\nFigueora comments on the idea of oil as motivation when he remarks, “it’s the access to millions of gallons of ‘black gold’ that really excites the White House” (Figueora, 11), as well as on the perception that successful grandiose action will ensure re-election-- “this time the vote in Florida won’t be close, trust me” (Figueora, 11). Figueora bluntly discusses the Bush’s hypothetical motivation for invading Cuba as he explains that Americans have located the oil but now need to “[overthrow] Fidel so we can go get it” (Figueora, 11). The directness of such an assertion reflects a common critique, espoused by George Soros, of America’s self-serving motivation for war with Iraq.\n\nIn <em>The Bubble of American Supremacy</em>, Soros discusses Bush’s possible reasons for initiating war on Iraq and focuses on America’s limited resources of oil saying, “to lift the [oil] embargo with Saddam Hussein still in power might have made him too dangerous; therefore he had to be removed from power” (Soros, 53). To emphasize this idea of American self-interest, Figueora makes allusion to a past attempt to overthrow Castro in the Bay of Pigs Invasion. That “ill-fated attack” (Figueora, 11) was only “half-hearted” says Figueora, but in the current attack, he counters, we’re going to “kick butt and take over” (Figueora, 11). Figueora creates an implied link between the half-heartedness of the previous attempt and its ultimate failure. He elaborates that the attack will be “nothing like” that of 1961, implying not only dissimilar effects but also different incentives. While the Bay of Pigs Invasion was spurred by a hatred of communism, the current attack is motivated by personal gain, lower gas prices, and “a big political payoff” (Figueora, 11) for the President. In this way, Figueora broaches the topic of American Supremacy, the concern that America considers only its own interests. Out of these subtleties and allusions as well as blatant exaggerations, Figueora fashions an allegorical critique of American political action, a fictional story with real implications.\n\nYet, not only the content of Figueora’s article serves as an allegory of the War in Iraq, but also the style in which he creates his argument. By quoting only the President himself and “unnamed” White House officials, Figueora approaches the article through the perspective of the party now in power, the conservatives. In a way, this perspective allows him to more effectively critique the conservative ideology. Endowing himself with the power to exaggerate the conservative opinions, he creates a subversive parody of the current government.\n\nIn his argument in favor of invading Cuba, Figueora mimics the rhetorical techniques employed by George W. Bush during his rationalization of initiating war in Iraq. In a speech Bush made to the National Press Conference on March 6, 2003, the President attempted to kindle American patriotism by tying his desire to commence war in Iraq to the memory of the terrorist attacks of September 11th. Despite the fact that the government found “no proven ties” (Soros, 41) between Saddam Hussein and the Al Qaeda terrorists, Bush continually made comments setting the two parties as parallel threats. In one blunt attempt to draw an analogy between the terrorist threat from Iraq and Al Qaeda, Bush avowed that “the attacks of September 11th, 2001 showed what the enemies of America did with four airplanes. We will not wait to see what terrorists or terrorist states could do with weapons of mass destruction” (Bush).\n\nIn the same manner, Figueora juxtaposes references to Saddam Hussein in the plans to overthrow Fidel Castro saying, “Cuban dictator Fidel Castro could soon be out of power and in jail – just like Saddam Hussein” (Figueora, 11). Figueora creates an exaggerated parallelism even more evidently contrived then that of the President in order to cast a light of enmity on Castro, just as Bush had cast that same light on Hussein. The lack of subtlety in Figueora’s juxtapositions appears to serve as a direct parody of Bush’s rationalization of war. The style in which Figueora composes his article creates a further allegory in itself of the manipulated rhetoric used by President Bush to gather support for a war with Iraq.\n\nThrough the creation of fictional scenarios and the use of occasionally fictional, often real political figures, <em>The Weekly World News</em> engineers a series of political allegories which mirror both the divisive nature of our political system and the failures and inconsistencies of American political action. These allegories, offer readers not only a sensationalized and fantasized version of modern American current events, but also a glimpse of the uncertainty and concern that many Americans feel when they learn of these proceedings. The fantastical imagery and symbolism of far-fetched supermarket tabloids provide stories of American politics and power that few other forms of media are at liberty to tell. By taking such a subversive approach, disguising political critique as entertainment, tabloid journalists catch their readers unaware. They force even the unwilling reader to recognize some level of hypocrisy whether only in the allegory or itself, or in the current events which it represents. These supermarket tabloids provide a forum to disagree with current political policies without doing so directly. They create an allegory which, when read literally, merely weaves a tale similar to the unfolding of events in our contemporary society. Yet, when recognized for their hypocrisy, these tales open up a world for the critiquing; they create a forum for discreetly recognizing the flaws of one’s government without betraying one’s own political inclinations.\n\n&nbsp;', 'Tabloid Absurdity: Allegories of a Contemporary American Political Crisis by Monique Wolkoff', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '303-autosave', '', '', '2012-03-23 15:51:44', '2012-03-23 15:51:44', '', 303, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?p=337', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

And further, what happens when these two modes of our understanding collide? It would seem that belief and reason are mutually exclusive, that whenever they come into contact there must be a victor and a loser—that a choice must be made about which way of understanding we choose to embrace. We struggle daily to reconcile the beliefs we choose to accept with the empirical knowledge we cannot ignore.\nE.M. Forster’s essay, “What I Believe” addresses this pervasive mental struggle. Forster’s ultimate humanist goal in the essay is to find a life philosophy independent from the dogma of religion, evidenced by his opening sentences, “I do not believe in Belief. But this is an age of faith, and there are so many militant creeds that, in self-defense, one has to formulate a creed of one’s own” (67). He suggests his era embraces the notion of religious faith too wholeheartedly, and he wants to develop a functional alternative. To achieve this, Forster affirms that life should be lived to create, ultimately, “tolerance, good temper, and sympathy” (67). In his attempt to reach this philosophical ideal, he highlights the inevitability of turning to belief, even in his fiercely non-religious worldview. Forster’s essay raises, and may implicitly answer, the enduring question: Can reason coexist with belief? In the essay, it becomes apparent that reason can, in fact, coexist with belief, provided that belief is founded upon and cooperative with empirical and philosophical derivations. That is, provided it is not blind faith.\nFrom the outset of his essay, Forster criticizes religion and the tenets it seeks to uphold. The very first sentence of the essay, “I do not believe in belief,” suggests that Forster withholds his commitment to anything requiring blind-faith acceptance of a rule (67). He feels assaulted by the “militant creeds” of the Age of Faith, or religious reactionism, and writes in part to defend his humanistic principles against this threat (67). One of the more pointed rejections of religious faith is expressed in his discussion of the principles of Christianity, “[The orthodox say] man has failed and always will fail to organize his own goodness, and it is presumptuous of him to try. This claim—solemn as it is— leaves me cold. I cannot believe that Christianity will ever cope with the present worldwide mess…” (75). He is arguing that it is man’s duty to clarify for himself his own values. This argument for intellectual independence characterizes Forster’s stance on the issue of belief, leaving no doubt that he is opposed to religious faith.\nA consequence of Forster’s wholehearted rejection of blind faith, religion, and maybe even God, is that is seems he must develop his own philosophy based exclusively on reason. But paradoxically peppered throughout the essay are passages that both triumphantly accept reason, and implicitly praise faith. This is not a logical pitfall of Forster’s essay but a manifestation of the subtle distinction between religious faith and humanistic faith that Forster seeks to establish. Regarding personal relationships he claims, “For the purpose of living one has to assume that the personality is solid and the self is an entity, and to ignore all contrary evidence. And since to ignore evidence is one of the characteristics of faith, I can certainly proclaim I believe in personal relationships” (68). Furthermore, he explains, “The people I respect most behave as if they were immortal and as if society was eternal” (71). Both these quotes contain an explicit abandonment of reason and an acceptance of faith. But even so, Forster carves a distinction between the religious belief he feels is reckless and the principled belief he feels is both constructive and unavoidable. Subscribing to religious dogma does not satisfy Forster’s skeptical stance on faith, but holding to considered, principled beliefs like the ones above do. Ultimately, he understands that reason and belief are hopelessly intertwined, and that there is a correct and constructive way to arrive at belief, and an incorrect, destructive way. Given the historical context of the essay, this principle is particularly poignant.\nPublished in 1938, “What I Believe” was written in the throes of the political and social instability that led to World War II. A number of remarks within the essay point to Forster’s acute awareness of the unrest of the time. He discusses a “gathering political storm,” mentions the merits of democracy allowing “public criticism” and avoiding “hushed up scandals,” mentions “labor camps” as a consequence of extreme governmental control, and notably ambiguously asserts “some people idealize force and pull it to the foreground and worship it” (68, 69, 70). Clearly, Forster was well aware of the brewing political issues of World War II and his essay is in part a reaction to the philosophical confusion and gravity of the coming war. When viewed in this light, the dissonance between belief and reason takes on new meaning. The war itself highlighted the fact that two logically derived diverging philosophies can exist and each side may still vehemently oppose the other. In the struggle of democracy vs. totalitarianism at which Forster hints heavily, both sides had justifications for their stances and, of course, their rhetoric for each would have been particularly pervasive in 1938. The Axis powers asserted that totalitarianism provided order, cohesion, obedience, and efficiency and the Allied powers argued democracy promoted free speech, individual liberties, creativity, and social justice (Palmieri)\n(Griggs ). Both sides had their intellectual stances, but both possessed something further: faith that their cause was correct. Just as Forster sought to define a humanistic philosophy that satisfied his ideals, the two sides developed their philosophies to satisfy their preconceived faith. Forster captures this quiet parallel in his extensive discussion of democracy, and maybe most revealingly demonstrates his fears in the conclusion of his essay, “…one likes to say what one thinks while speech is comparatively free: it may not be free much longer” (76). Clearly, Forster understands the war and its ideological struggle may come at a heavy cost.\nBut what is the importance of the philosophical dichotomy between the Allied and Axis powers and its phantom presence within the context of Forster’s essay? It illustrates how belief is inexorably intertwined with reason. That is, we use reason to accommodate belief and belief to accommodate reason. Forster, in his essay, was using the irony of rejecting one belief and asserting another to capture the futility of arguing a point based largely, or entirely, on blind faith. This parallels the political struggle of the time. At the same time, he understands faith is inevitable and is wrestling with the implications of this reality. Faced with war and the potential losses of lives and freedom, a satisfying solution to the issue of belief vs. reason seems particularly urgent. Ultimately, he knows he cannot argue his worldview against another if it is buoyed by dogma, so he seeks to change faith’s “big ‘F’” to a little “f” by transforming the monolithic faith necessary for religion with one that coincides with our innate sense of common humanity. He explains that the religious, those whose faith he does not support, “have faith with a large F. My faith has a very small one, and I only intrude it because these are very strenuous days” (76).\nTo Forster, faith is inevitable; blind faith is not. He illustrates that at some level we must accept certain central axioms on faith to live our intellectual lives at all (belief in personal relationships, the permanence of human civilization, democracy, an aristocracy of intelligentsia, etc.). We do not and cannot know if these are true, but our choice of what and what not to have faith in is not necessarily blind. It reflects our understanding of how the world is, and how we feel it should be, an empirically idealistic guess. Forster and those who subscribe to his distinction between beliefs, attempt to capture how the world appears, and further, how it should work. Forster embraces relationships, aristocracy of intelligentsia, living life as if it had no end, and acting as if civilization was eternal not because he knows these things are true, but because these satisfy his understanding of how the world must exist for a philosophically, humanistically, and personally satisfying life.\nForster does not reject faith—only faith stemming from religion. The chief difference between faith in religion and faith in principles, and the reason Forster makes this seemingly “splitting hairs” distinction, is that the former must necessarily be blind, while the latter is informed to the extent it reflects some ideal about the human condition reached through consideration, not dogmatic acceptance. Belief and reason are not in fact mutually exclusive, but are both unavoidable and can even complement each other handsomely, provided that faith is not employed as a simplistic and convenient replacement for thought, but as a mechanism for developing informed principles.', 'The Necessity of Belief', '', 'trash', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'the-necessity-of-belief', '', '', '2012-04-10 18:25:25', '2012-04-10 18:25:25', '', 0, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?post_type=essay&#038;p=467', 0, 'essay', '', 0),
(338, 8, '2012-03-01 16:14:56', '2012-03-01 16:14:56', 'by Geoff Aung\r\n\r\nAs I emerged from the T station, the year’s first snowfall greeted my face. I was back in Harvard Square, where I had lived the preceding summer while interning at the Democratic National Convention. I was pleased to return, but I knew it was to a different place. Out of Town News, Harvard Yard, the Quad, Felipe’s Taqueria: none of them were the same—the landscape had changed. The musicians had left the streets to find a lonely coffeehouse mic. The LaRouche proselytizers had left to hibernate for another four years. The t-shirts and sandals of summer sun had retreated in the face of winter’s austere countenance. My political innocence was gone, as well. Two weeks ago, the election had fallen upon me with all the heavy weight of reality. Challenged by the outcome, I was a changed person looking at a changed landscape: over everything, an inch of fresh snow.\r\n\r\nI walked slowly to my friend’s dorm where I would be spending the weekend. Quiet lingered in the air. I could hear the soft crunch of New Balance on slush. It was as if the election had hastened the arrival of winter, as if the capitol of liberal politics was eager to retreat to the safety of the fireside. There, in oak-paneled studies with bookcases, thinking citizens would insulate themselves from the anti-intellectual New America, thumbing endlessly through back copies of the <em>New Yorker</em>, mourning past evocations of hope and possibility. I peered through the humble Puritan windowpanes along Dunster Street, convinced that those citizens were in each room. I watched my breath disappear in the falling snow, wondering where American borders really lie.\r\n\r\nByron E. Shafer opens his book <em>Bifurcated Politics</em> by admitting, “Even in an era when it is widely viewed as an institution in decline, the national party convention retains a certain immediate, raw, and visceral fascination” (1). I can sympathize. As a young politico working the convention, being in such a high-level political environment was exciting. I spoke to Jesse Jackson and James Carville on the phone. Terry McAuliffe (T-Mac to those in the know) was constantly in my midst. I shook hands with Barack Obama and Larry David, and I took a picture with George McGovern. Teresa Heinz Kerry signed my poster. I patiently awaited my CNN interview with cellphone in hand and credentials around my neck.\r\n\r\nWhat I was less apt to recognize was the “institution in decline” part of the experience. We the convention committee (in order to form a more perfect union), perched atop a skyscraper looking down on the Old State House, would hear about Mayor Menino’s problems with the police union. We would hear that Boston was going to lose—rather than gain, as was originally believed—significant sums of money on the convention. We would hear the complaints of Bostonians: too much traffic, altered public transportation, increased terrorist threat. We would hear, but we weren’t really listening. After all, they, the complainers, were on the outside. They couldn’t understand that it was all necessary. What did they know?\r\n\r\nIn her essay “Insider Baseball,” Joan Didion speaks to my experience. Writing about the Dukakis campaign of 1988, she considers the “assumption” of people within politics that “the narrative should be not just written only by its own specialists but also legible only to its own specialists” (50). Part of me thought that since I had an ID card that said DNC 2004 on it, I was more qualified to assess the convention. Those on the other side of the glass didn’t really know what they were talking about.\r\n\r\nDidion also details a scene in which Dukakis plays catch with one of his campaign aides on an airport tarmac. Didion writes:\r\n<blockquote>What we had in the tarmac arrival with ball tossing, then, was an understanding: a repeated moment witnessed by many people, all of whom believed it to be a setup and yet most of whom believed that only an outsider, only someone too ‘naïve’ to know the rules of the game, would so describe it. (65)</blockquote>\r\nDamned if I would be naïve. A friend of mine who had worked on the Dean campaign in New Hampshire (and was now in Vietnam on a fellowship) complained about the unnecessary level of control and choreography that he saw going into the convention. I told him it was all necessary: the lighting cues, the careful choice of music, the placement of the delegations on the floor, the speakers’ obligation to submit speeches beforehand for approval. “We can’t risk a disorganized appearance,” I insisted, “there is too much at stake.” What we needed, I believed (not uniquely, I might add), was to project an image of unified professionalism that would dispel, among other things, notions of a party torn by an extraordinarily divisive primary season. John Kerry was our man, and he would deliver us from George W. Bush’s dark presidency. Any calls for a more natural political forum misunderstood political strategy. Those who made those calls were, by definition, “outsiders.”\r\n\r\nThe narrative of insiderism that the convention unwittingly created proved to be destructive to its appeal. A bubble—dreaded in theory, embraced in practice—surrounded all things DNC. I remember on Thursday night, the last night of the whole spectacle, my friend Eric, who was interning for CNN, was able to get me into a party at the Roxy. Maroon 5 played the event. In the middle of the set, John Edwards—sleeves rolled up, tie loosened, mic in hand—appeared onstage in front of a dramatic green light as a fog machine did its thing. He looked heroic, almost godlike. He engaged the crowd: “This may look like a concert, this may feel like a concert, and this may sound like a concert.” The crowd quieted. We waited for his words. “But this is a movement.” We erupted. We were, of course, ready to cheer.\r\n\r\nEven this memory—one I recall so fondly—has paled since the election. Whereas I originally experienced it in terms of Shafer’s raw, visceral fascination, now I can’t help but see the shadow of decay about it, evidence of a declining institution. There I stood with two different credentials (one for the Fleet, one for the Roxy) in the plastic sleeve on my “Democrats Win It in the Field” lanyard, supposedly affirming some sort of “movement.” Was this the field? Was this where we were supposed to win it? After leaving one closed event, I was now at another closed event, both of which had further levels of exclusivity within them. Even worse, we—supposedly the party of the First Amendment—feared protests so much that we restricted peaceful demonstrations to an aptly named “Free Speech Zone” festooned with nets to “protect the delegates.” On the closing night of the convention, I stared as hundreds of police donned storm trooper riot gear and clogged the surrounding streets.\r\n\r\nWe assumed the movement Edwards referred to must have been some sort of popular uprising against the Republicans. But surely velvet ropes and nightsticks do not comprise a popular movement. In Boston, Massachusetts, the seat of leftist American politics, America’s foremost liberal party managed to hold a convention detested by the city’s citizens. Having always believed the Democrats to be a populist alternative to the stodgy GOP, I associated them with popular appeal. After all, Jules Witcover calls his history of the Democrats Party of the People. But the character of their convention—our convention, as it were—denied any such claim. In the end, far from anything I could have imagined earlier, exclusion may have been the name of the game. It certainly was at all of the satellite events: the Media Party in south Boston, the Rock the Vote party at the Avalon, the delegate parties throughout the week, the closing party at the Roxy. A prevailing insiderism dominated what was supposed to be our chance to show the country we were not a party of distant intellectual elites. It reminds me of my high school history teacher’s favorite phrase: “Lost opportunity.”\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe parties, the symposiums, the caucuses, the book signings, the balloons, the music, the traffic, the t-shirts: all this, and for what? Conventions simply boost a general election season by approving a candidate already chosen. In reality, the DNC is little more than an extravagantly expensive gas station on the campaign trail. How expensive? The <em>Boston Globe</em> set the estimated cost of the convention at $95 million (Klein). Is it really justifiable to put that much money into such a weak institution, an institution whose own biographer considers it to be declining? If the convention were to serve a more pivotal purpose, such funding might be excusable; but to throw so much money at ratifying a foregone conclusion seems downright irresponsible.\r\n\r\nThe convention as an institution has not always been so weak. It was not always like today’s incarnation, essentially a well-dressed figurehead strutting around with a practiced air of self-importance. In fact, political conventions began in 1832 as a reaction against the same elite class that today’s conventions serve to propel. It was the nation’s first third party of note, the Anti-Masons, which introduced the concept of a national political convention. In <em>Party of the People</em>, Jules Witcover writes:\r\n<blockquote>(The Anti-Mason convention) was born of a case of the suspected murder of one William Morgan, of Batavia, New York, a former member of the secret Society of Freemasons who disappeared as he was about to publish an exposé of the society. Attempts to block its publication created demands for an investigation and ultimately a clamor against Masons in public office, culminating in a call for a convention to nominate a presidential candidate. (143)</blockquote>\r\nIronically, that convention nominated William Wirt, a rather uninteresting candidate who specifically stated his indifference to Masonry, to stand against Masons Andrew Jackson and Henry Clay (Witcover 143). However, much like today’s third parties, the Anti-Masons were less interested in a viable campaign than in national attention to their issues of import. As Shafer writes, “The quickest route to national stature was a presidential campaign, but the new party could hardly launch such a campaign with the dominant nominating device to that date, a caucus of party members in the U.S. Congress, because it possessed none” (9). From that point on, the national convention would replace the party caucus as the primary theater of presidential nomination. How strange it would be for the Anti-Masons to see the national convention, this child of theirs, existing today on the lifeblood of exclusivity and police security.\r\n\r\nIn terms of power, 1832 marked the beginning of a period that would last until 1952, at which point the convention began to look quite like the current ones. Within this period, the convention exhibited great power, deposing numerous sitting presidents, including John Tyler, Millard Fillmore, Franklin Pierce, and Chester Arthur. It also chose dark-horse candidates like James K. Polk (Shafer 15). Convention discourse centered mostly around the nominee in question, with some conventions featuring extended debate on whom to choose. But the decline of local political parties, as exemplified by New Deal legislation, had prepared the original convention character for its last hurrah in 1952. Shafer writes, “The Democratic convention of 1952 was the last of the classic old-style party gatherings and featured behavior which in its essence would have been familiar to convention participants a hundred years before” (33). He continues: “The product of this politicking, the candidate, had entered no primaries and engaged in no direct campaigning prior to his nomination” (33). Every convention thereafter demonstrated the shift of the nomination away from the convention itself and into the primary season, creating a movement towards today’s condition in which the convention serves only to approve a decision already made.\r\n\r\nThat shift accelerated in 1968 due to the tumultuous Democratic convention in Chicago, at which tens of thousands of protestors took their dissent to the streets. Their calls for bringing the political process nearer to the people ushered in an era of reform politics that saw the proliferation of the primary season, one perceived solution to the problem of high-level political bureaucracy. As a result, the convention evolved into the weakened form it holds to this day (Shafer 42). Stripped of its original nominating function, the convention began to look more like a risk than an opportunity. The two election cycles of the 1970’s demonstrated this idea. Shafer writes:\r\n<blockquote>In 1972, a Democratic convention featuring deep divisions between the nominee and his challengers and between the nominee and some of his own delegates was paired with a Republican convention featuring little evident conflict in either area. Yet only four years later, it was the Republican convention which manifested the major candidate conflict, along with exacerbating issue divisions, while the Democratic convention escaped candidate splits entirely and surfaced only minor issue conflicts to fuel its limited struggles. (150)</blockquote>\r\nIn both 1972 and 1976, the party that presented a more unified convention won the general election. This contrast between unity and disunity, unity triumphing each time, proved to be a lesson politicians would not soon forget. With the potential for a divisive primary season constantly threatening to produce an image of a party in conflict, conventions began to focus energy on polished appearance rather than honest debate. Disunity, an ominous sign of weakness, took on the characteristics of a risk to avoid at all costs.\r\n\r\nFor better or for worse, it seems the Democrats know their history. The 1970s conventions set a precedent—unity at all costs—that the national parties emulate to this day. One can imagine T-Mac and convention CEO Rod O’Connor sitting in a well-lit office late at night pondering the official convention slogan. America 2004: The Democratic Convention, or America 2004: A Stronger America? The differences are subtle, even aesthetic. But by July 26, the message had changed from the former to the latter. There could be nothing weak about this convention; history warns as much. “Strong” necessarily conjures images of unity, for strength is predicated on organized support. At the expense of a real political forum, we proceed with this historically fortified notion of strength, for we have learned the lessons of the ’70s. Certainly “unschooled” has never been an accusation leveled at Democrats. Nevertheless, the Golden Age of conventions is dead, and even the current age declines. Surely Swinburne waxed rhetorical when he asked, “Is not Precedent a king of men?”\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNow that the post-election pall had descended and winter had frozen over Harvard Square, I began to reevaluate my memories. After all, “we” had lost. This summer, good little Democrat that I was, I probably would have described the color of the convention as some sort of fluorescent blue. Now I might side with the dreaded gray. Neither red nor blue, Republican nor Democratic, just—gray. Perhaps my experience of disillusionment is simply a function of election depression. Or perhaps the election has been my apple, and I have eaten of it. Either way, I recall feeling like we had something—whether it was momentum, passion, or truth on our side, I’m not sure. But there was something that has faded now.\r\n\r\nThe November issue of <em>Harper’s</em>, which was released before the election, aptly demonstrates the Democrats’ obsession with presenting a united front. Ironically, it is Luke Mitchell’s essay about the Republican convention that accomplishes this, even as he lets the Democrats off the hook. He writes, “Whereas Kerry had struggled to create meaning—no matter how stupid, dishonest, or clichéd that meaning was—Bush’s team seemed actively to be plotting its demise” (67). Mitchell treats Kerry kindly, keenly aware of the approaching Tuesday. Mitchell continues, considering the discussion that took place in the Garden: “These were half-narratives, made up of questions so preposterous as to end discussion and possibly even subvert our understanding of what it means to mean something…The real message, radiating from the podium and echoing through the rafters, was that there was no message” (67). It is not difficult to imagine a covert Luke Mitchell marooned in The Red Sea, subconsciously holding his nose while straining his ears to catch the words between the echoes. The fact that he couldn’t decipher any message suggests that the Republicans know their historical precedents, too: Organization at the expense of meaning.\r\n\r\nBut now that the election is over and all may speak freely, one must wonder if Mitchell would still excuse Kerry. Perhaps not—I, for one, with hindsight shaded by the election, find his appraisal of the Republicans quite applicable to the Democrats. The Dems’ platform professes “a profound optimism about our future—an optimism that springs from our great faith in America” (Strong 1). In terms of gritty policy-talk that one might expect from a political platform, the document sounds more like a stump speech. It avoids confronting Iraq, turning that question instead into a section called “Strengthening Our Military.” It says, “We will add 40,000 new soldiers—not to increase the number of soldiers in Iraq, but to sustain our overseas deployments and prevent and prepare for other possible conflicts” (13). Worse, the title of the platform, the overall message, amounts to more of a non-message: “Strong at Home, Respected in the World.” Who can argue with such a stance? Is it a stance? The statement is eternally malleable: Anyone could mold it to his or her particular ideology. It is both isolationist and internationalist. It is both militant and gradualist. In essence, it is both liberal and conservative. It draws no lines, because it comes down on the side of no one. Even as the Dems tried to learn from history’s convenient lessons, they came up short. The Democratic message tried to be all things to all people—and still the electoral map bleeds endlessly. Perhaps we spoke directly to no one. Such is the risk of a politics of caution. In my own words, “There is too much at stake.”\r\n\r\nMitchell realizes that risk. In a later passage in his essay, he discusses the effort of the Republican convention to appear completely inoffensive, an effort I found similar to the Democrats’. He tries to recount the atmosphere of the Garden to a friend, who refers him to E.M. Forster’s <em>A Passage to India</em>. “It’s the Marabar Caves,” his friend tells him. Mitchell notes, “He was almost impossibly right.” Forster describes the caves:\r\n<blockquote>Whatever is said, the same monotonous noise replies, and quivers up and down the walls until it is absorbed into the roof. “Boum” is the sound as far as the human alphabet can express it, or “bou-oum,” or “ou-boum,” ­ utterly dull. Hope, politeness, the blowing of a nose, the squeak of a boot, all produce “boum”…. (68)</blockquote>\r\nIn a literal sense, the Marabar Caves recall to me the first night of the convention, when I was sitting very high up in the Fleet Center, straining my ears to hear the Clintons. The echoes were definitely overwhelming at times, and I missed much of what was said. But Mitchell cites Forster to get at something deeper. What Mitchell is concerned about is the conscious decision to sterilize discourse, to the extent that blowing one’s nose and expressions of hope both sound like “boum.” Both parties are guilty of this transgression; most likely the Republicans just play the game better. Forster realizes this, too. In the same passage, he writes, “Echoes generate echoes.” Today, echoes generate elections.\r\n\r\nAs I approached Kirkland House, my friend’s Harvard dorm, I took my earbuds out so I could concentrate on the directions he had given me. First gate on the right, proceed into the courtyard, turn left, look for the dining hall. No one had shoveled the walkway in the courtyard yet; I left footprints in the snow as I walked towards the door. Through the tall windows, I could see chandeliers and crowded tables. It looked warm inside.\r\n\r\nMonths before, we had visited this building, often late at night, so that my friend (who also interned with me) could show me where he would be living for the next three years of college. Another friend of his was spending the summer in the next house over, Eliot House, so we would go there, too, and we would have long political discussions in the night. We were like the “pink-cheeked young aides” Didion recalls in her essay, thinking of ourselves, “innocent of irony and therefore history, as ‘the best and the brightest’” (56). It rarely—if ever—occurred to me that the next time I would return, winter’s cold winds would have swooped down on the wings of the election to clear the landscape. There was an air of immortality about our convention work that summer. I assumed victory and the concomitant vindication would have taken place by now. From the heights of the Fleet Center, defeat looked impossible.\r\n\r\nIn <em>The Politics of National Party Conventions</em>, David, Goldman and Bain write: “Convention decisions cut close to the great political concerns of any society: the allocation of political power, the purposes for which political power shall be used, and the further evolution of the political system” (2). As a representative institution, as a symbol of a larger political process, the convention does not bode well for the future of politics. If the characteristics of this summer’s Democratic convention were to continue—the tendency towards insiderism, the construction of the “boum”—American politics would have some work to do before it could once again call itself a worthwhile organ of a government that pretends to democracy.\r\n\r\nEven now, in the wake of a disastrous election, the Democrats’ discussion of the future seems less interested in lasting change than more of the same. Take, for example, the theater in which a recent discussion took place. The New York Times reports that “Most of the party’s biggest names headed to former Clinton campaign adviser James Carville’s party at the old Arkansas Gazette Building, which served as the headquarters of Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign. Some partied at Doe’s Eat Place, an old Democratic hangout” (Democrats 1). That gathering sounds like a smaller version of this summer’s convention: elite figures discussing the nation’s future over cocktails. The words “old Democratic hangout” fall harshly upon my ears. But even the discourse itself comes up short. Governor Bill Richardson says, “I remember being on a trip with him in New Mexico: I put a cowboy hat on Senator Kerry and someone on his staff shuddered and asked me to stop. This is I think an example of the East Coast not connecting with the West Coast and with the rest of the country” (Nagourney 2). If Governor Richardson is right, this country is in a sad place: he believes it is more effective to pander to the “rest of the country” through empty props than actually to address issues they care about. Surely it’s less—not more—of Richardson’s theatrics that the political process needs.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I am simply unschooled in politics’ dark arts. Surely there are mysteries I cannot comprehend. After all, I am merely a has-been pink-cheeked young aide, stepping softly through the snow to meet up with my friend. If I was an insider before, by now I am a definite outsider. Apparently, you need not be one or the other to care. As for those thinking citizens, hibernating with stacks of the New Yorker, I found them in the Kirkland dining hall, discussing the Warren Court for a paper due in three days. Outside, on the trees and in the gardens, across the lawns and in the sky, the falling snow cleansed the canvas, painting over everything with a broad white stroke. Preparation for rebirth had already begun, for the winter always precedes the spring.\r\n<div align="right"><a href="http://www.columbia.edu/itc/uwp/journal/2004/pdf/AUNG.pdf"><em>Open as PDF (PDF, 130K) </em><img src="http://www.columbia.edu/itc/uwp/journal/pdf.gif" alt="" border="0" /></a></div>\r\n<em>posted by cu-uwp</em> Keywords: e1, essay 1, 2004', 'Returning to Boston ', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '18-autosave', '', '', '2012-03-01 16:14:56', '2012-03-01 16:14:56', '', 18, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?p=338', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

(402, 8, '2012-02-27 04:13:24', '2012-02-27 04:13:24', 'When local villagers of Godamuri first encountered the wolf children of Minapore in 1920, they immediately suspected that the wild creatures were Manush-Bagha, Bengali for ghost-headed man-bodied beasts. Driven by curiosity and eager to dispel local superstitions, Reverend J. A. L. Singh led a band of men into the jungle where he found two “hideous-looking beings” (Singh &amp; Zingg 5) huddled with a band of wolf pups in an old ant mound. Singh took the wolf-raised children back to his orphanage and named the younger one Amala and the elder Kamala. Singh kept a diary and recorded detailed observations of their feral behavior, such as the girls’ four-legged prowling and mangled midnight imitations of the noises the wolves made. Amala died a year after her introduction to human society, but her older sister lived on. Singh continued to painstakingly document Kamala’s “tardy development from a wolf-like existence to that of a human being” (Singh &amp; Zingg 38).\r\n\r\nThough Singh was deeply concerned with the well-being of the wolf-children, his diary was essentially a scientific case study, and he took a rational, dispassionate approach. This perspective prevented him from having to truly acknowledge the subjects of his investigations as human beings. He was more interested in the connection between heredity and the influence of environment, and he studied the feral children’s ability to comprehend language and their capacity for human emotion. Singh noted that when the children smiled, it was merely to show internal satisfaction of basic needs such as hunger. He wrote that “unlike human pleasures and joys, theirs were confined in a very narrow circle, while those of mankind are extensive, circumscribed by time only . . . All this spoke of a peculiar joy among animals only.” By contrasting their emotions with those of humans, Singh constructed a barrier between the feral children and ordinary people. Singh often made gestures towards eliciting sympathy in the reader, but he then qualified it with impassive statements. A year after capturing the children, he observed:\r\n\r\nKamala shed tears—a drop from each eye was seen trickling down her cheeks—only at the time when Amala breathed her last on the early morning of Wednesday, the twenty-first of September, 1921. Beyond this, emotional faculties were dormant, and not appreciable.\r\n\r\nThus, the most tragic event in Kamala’s life became an occasion for the study of emotion. The death of Amala clearly had its impact on Kamala, who spent nearly three days facing a wall and refusing to eat. But because she could not outwardly express her emotions, Singh concluded (with a belittling “only”) that she could not truly feel as a human being.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, Singh’s main goal was to present an objective understanding of feral children; eliciting sympathy was only his secondary aim, yet he still suffered from what Elizabeth Costello would have characterized as a “tragically limited” perspective. In a fictional speech at Applegate College, Elizabeth Costello, the character created by J. M. Coeztee in a 2003 novel by that same name argues that “the question to ask should not be: “Do we have something in common […] with other animals?” (Coetzee 34). Instead, Costello, who is a famous writer, believes that the way to ensure universal understanding is to break all barriers that separate the superiority of humans from the supposed inferiority of animals. She calls for us to recognize the spark of life and “embodied soul” (Coetzee 33) shared by all living creatures.\r\n\r\nCostello argues that if, as an author, she can think her way into the existence of a fictional character then it is possible to imagine ourselves into the existence of any living being. By this logic, the perspective of a child raised by wolves should not be difficult to understand at all. According to Costello, nothing can be viewed as “a fundamentally alien form of life” as long as it shares with us “the substrate of life.” Of course, Costello herself is not a real person, but the reader of Coetzee’s novel is still able to appreciate and understand her point of view. In fact, the reader herself becomes a vehicle in proving Coetzee’s point: the creative imagination has the power to extend beyond rational thought.\r\n\r\nCostello not only argues for but embodies the sympathetic imagination that Singh’s rationalist perspective lacks. Singh was so fascinated by the extent to which feral children differed from either humans or wolves that he failed to appreciate them on their own terms. In attempting to compare feral children to ordinary human beings, Singh finds that the wild child’s capabilities inevitably fall short, and he concludes that they lack the ability to reason. The danger of this perspective is that it implies feral children are unlike man and are not “godlike” but “thinglike” (Coetzee 23). With this belief, we open ourselves up to the possibility of treating them like “things,” too. It is clear that lack of imaginative compassion has dire consequences.\r\n\r\nLike Coetzee’s Costello, Martha Nussbaum calls upon imaginative compassion as the basis of our perspective towards other beings, but at the same time recognizes its unreliability. While Costello has no problem imagining herself in the form of a bat or even a corpse, Nussbaum acknowledges that there are obstacles in understanding any living thing. Nussbaum recalls an educational program director in rural India, who, when asked how a foreigner would understand the suffering of another person in another country, indicated the scope of the problem. He replied, “I have the greatest difficulty understanding my own sister” (Nussbaum 26).\r\n\r\nAnother problem with compassion is that it has the potential of slipping into partisan loyalty. As an example, Nussbaum cites the first baseball game in Chicago played after September 11, incidentally against the Yankees. Due to an increased awareness of the situation of New Yorkers, and perhaps the volume of beer consumed, the spectators began to chant “U-S-A, U-S-A.” At first, the chant was uttered as a sign of national unity, but eventually it devolved into a display of anger against the umpire after he made a questionable call.\r\n\r\nAlthough severing all attachments may be one extreme way to guard against loyalty to one’s own tribe, team, family, city, or species, Nussbaum does not believe in the option of universal impartiality. The extermination of these connections, she asserts, would only result in “death within life” (Nussbaum 23). Nussbaum suggests that we retain our local attachments while engaging with other cultures and experiences. She calls this critical compassion: a sympathy heightened by imagination and sensitivity to the arts. Nussbaum believes in the role of “tragic art in promoting good citizenship” and in the artist’s ability “to awaken a larger sense of the humanity of suffering” (Nussbuam 25). Tragic art, such as Euripides, dramatizes the loss of local attachments but also places them in a context that crosses cultural and temporal boundaries. Through these works of art, we vicariously experience the pain of others and transcend the limits of our own understanding.\r\n\r\nOnce we have honed our capacity for critical compassion, we may approach feral children in a new way. Although Karen Russell’s short story, “St. Lucy’s Home for Girls Raised by Wolves,” isn’t exactly tragic art, it contains loss and sorrow on a scale significant enough that we sympathize with the protagonists. “St Lucy’s” is the story of human children of werewolf parents who have been sent to a sanctuary managed by nuns who aimed to “humanize” the young girls. In order to help the children transition into society, the authoritative nuns erase the girls’ original names (‘GWARR!’ and ‘HWRAA!’) and re-christen them Jeanette and Mirabella. The girls struggle to suppress their lupine ways and adopt the human code of falsities and formality. The story of the girls of “St. Lucy’s” bears many similarities to that of Amala and Kamala, but the key difference is that Karen Russell, unlike Reverend Singh, is able to engage our critical compassion. Russell describes how the girls lose their local attachments and societal connections. Even so, Russell is able to narrate from a distinctly wolfish point of view:\r\n\r\nThose were the days when we dreamed of rivers and meat. The full-moon nights were the worst! Worse than cold toilet seats and boiled tomatoes, worse than trying to will our tongues to curl around our false new names.\r\n\r\nRussell enters the mind of a wolf-girl so seamlessly that everything we regard as completely normal—even cooked vegetables and toilet seats—suddenly becomes alien. It is this disengagement from the human world that allows the reader to fully enter the realm of the wolf-girls. From the feral point of view, being human means knowing how to apologize, play golf, say “How do you do,” talk about the weather, and carry out other decorous social rituals. Humans are not civilized but “bred in captivity” (Russell 236), trapped by their own sense of civilized refinement.&lt;\r\n\r\nRussell’s wolf-children are the stuff of myths; nowadays children raised in the wild are extremely rare. But by stepping into the paws of the wolf-children, we gain an objective standpoint from which to recognize the contradictions and artificialities of our own human society. As Costello argues, sympathy is “all about the subject,” not the object. Costello’s act of imagining herself as a bat does nothing to affect the well-being of the bat. In reality, it is the act itself that has changed the subject and the subject’s ability to view the world around her.\r\n\r\nOur compassion then is for our own benefit: the simple act of empathizing is a lesson in self-awareness. We can consider using our critical compassion to imagine ourselves as various animals whose lives are directly or indirectly affected by our own. It is not enough for us to imagine ourselves as a bat; we need to examine how this perspective affects human lives, customs, and rituals that are taken for granted. Imagine yourself, then, as the rat in the subway running away with your discarded bagel, or the squirrel guarding the last Redwood, or the mosquito landing on your arm. If you briefly distance yourself from human attachments and gaze at the world though the eyes of another creature, you may notice something about yourself that you had never previously seen. Like Kamala discovering her own reflection in the mirror, you may find yourself unrecognizable.', 'Daughters of the Wild: The Feral and Human Perspective', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '261-autosave', '', '', '2012-02-27 04:13:24', '2012-02-27 04:13:24', '', 261, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?p=402', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

A preference for broad strokes, for the distortion and flattening of character and the reduction of events to narrative, has been for well over a hundred years the way the city presents itself.”\n—Joan Didion</p>\n</blockquote>\nWith its bright colors, rays of sun showering upon faces of influential leaders of different races, and inspiring slogans coined to stir the public to bridge the gap between races and socioeconomic divisions, a mural in the Soundview neighborhood of the South Bronx on 174th St. entitled <em>We Are Here to Awaken from the Illusion of Our Separateness</em> (Figs. 1-4) exemplifies a trend to create captivating and educational murals throughout New York City that deal with major socioeconomic and racial issues. The mural in the South Bronx gives the impression, even by virtue of its title alone, of a community with relatively surmountable social barriers between races and classes, in which “our separateness” is insignificant and the solution is to simply “awaken,” by realizing that our differences are “an illusion” — one that, in reality, doesn’t exist.\n\nBut taking a step back and viewing the community in which this mural is located leads one to a much less optimistic outlook on the future of social and racial equality than the mural would have one believe. According to a recent <em>New York Times</em> article, as of July 2006, Soundview, “long one of the city’s poorest communities”, doesn’t have one bank in hundreds of blocks filled with housing projects; in contrast to the “illusion of our separateness” described on the mural, one resident is said to travel 3 miles twice a week to the closest bank in the neighboring town of White Plains (NY Times). The reality of Soundview is that it’s “the city''s top shopping area—for car thieves” (Venezia); it’s an area “infested with crime and drugs” (Tran), and a neighborhood in which racial tensions found their breeding ground in 1999 when Amadou Diallo, an unarmed 22-year-old black man, was shot dead by 4 white cops. While the mural in Soundview considers this apparent state of affairs a type of “illusion,” the history of the neighborhood seems to render the mural the real illusion.\n\nThe proliferation of such murals, which tend to blur racial and socioeconomic riffs while celebrating that which New Yorkers share in common is what Joan Didion refers to, in her essay entitled “Sentimental Journeys,” as a “sentimental narrative,” a conception that “a reliance on certain magical gestures,” often substituted for effective political action, can alter the destiny of a city (225, 279).\n\nDidion traces the development of this narrative throughout New York City’s history, as authored by the media and public officials. She claims that these officials tended to “obscure not only the city’s actual tensions of race and class but also, more significantly, the civic and commercial arrangements that rendered those tensions irreconcilable” (Didion 280). Didion examines several social projects in the city, which received two kinds of publicity. Positive narratives focused on how the projects fostered racial and social blending. Negative narratives depicted the projects as flashpoints for crime. Both representations ignored the underlying issues of economic disparity and racial tension, which can lay the ground for violence and crime.\n\nDidion points to the creation of Central Park as a part of this ongoing, obscuring sentimental narrative. While Frederick Olmstead, the park’s creator, described it as a place which would “force into contact the good and the bad, the gentleman and the rowdy,” he ignored the fact that these groups may not share the same interests, and “the extent to which the condition of being rich was predicated upon the continued neediness of a working class” (Didion 282, 283). In ignoring such crucial facts while at the same time emphasizing less realistic visions of the park, Olmstead was participating in the sentimental narrative of New York.\n\nDidion analyzes specific instances of crime as the root of social problems; the touchstone example for Didion’s essay is the well-known “Central Park Jogger” case of 1990, in which a young woman was gang-raped. According to Didion, the media presentation ignored the racial and social tensions that were the real root causes of the rape. It did so by presenting a “conflation of victim and city,” in which “the crime’s ‘story’ would be found, its lesson, its encouraging promise of narrative resolution” (Didion 260). Didion describes how the victim in this case, known by the public as “The Jogger,” went unnamed in the press, and was instead used as a symbol for what John Gutfreund, the chairman of the company where the victim worked, described as “what makes this city so vibrant and so great” (260). On the other hand, her attackers were constantly named in order to show that “what was wrong with the city had been identified, and its names were Raymond Santana, Yusef Salaam” (Didion 270). According to William R. Taylor of SUNY, whom Didion cites, in publicizing crimes this way the media “localized suffering in particular moments…confined it to particular occasions [and] smoothed over differences,” thereby ignoring the more basic underlying tensions that allowed for such occasions (Didion 284).\n\nPublic murals in New York City comprise a new chapter of this ongoing narrative. The Groundswell Community Mural Project, the group responsible for the mural in Soundview, advertises itself online as “a New York City based nonprofit that brings together professional artists, grassroots organizations and communities in partnership to create high quality murals in under-represented neighborhoods” (groundswellmural.org). The murals displayed online, like the mural in Soundview, depict fundamental racial and socioeconomic equality in New York City and stress the need to improve its condition. Murals like these figure most prominently in relatively poor neighborhoods like the South Bronx and Harlem, where they most vividly emphasize the need for social change. In Washington Heights, another relatively poor neighborhood in NYC, a mural spanning the length of an entire building was painted to simultaneously help solve the problems of lead paint in that neighborhood and add an aesthetic quality to the neighborhood as well (groundswellmural.org). The mural, which portrays people with a bounty of fruits and vegetables, visiting doctors and taking care of their overall health, is one example of a mural that touches the sentiments and evokes positive feelings about life and health in a neighborhood in order to help amend more sweeping, general communal problems; in this case, the idea was that by using the mural to teach people about the positive effects of a healthy diet and medical treatment in helping to heal lead poisoning, the problem of lead poisoning would be diminished (groundswellmural.org). In Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, a group of kids painted a colorful mural entitled <em>One Community, Many Voices</em> (Fig. 5), featuring a plethora of flags flying in the air, rainbows, and people of many races, in order to promote diversity. A mural in Harlem entitled<em>Voices</em> (Figs. 6 &amp; 7) was, according to one of the teens involved in the painting, meant as a way “to get a better reality what is really needed in the urban communities [sic]. Whether it is more education or police for safe streets you know what the issues are by interviewing community members and the teens” (groundswellmural.org). “Painting a mural,” this person says, “is a great example to the young people of how hard work can pay off and how a task that was set can be completed.” According to Groundswell, “our work inspires youth, communities and artists to take active ownership of their future and equips them with the tools necessary for social change” (groundswellmural.org). It’s in this conflation of the mural with more basic “social change” that the sentimental narrative is located.\n\nJane Jacobs advocates a similar program for social change, according to which it’s precisely those sentiment-stirring, less drastic agendas that should be implemented. In her essay, she focuses on the need for “sidewalk contacts,” public settings which “bring together people who do not know each other in an intimate, private social fashion, and in most cases do not care to know each other in that fashion” (73, 72). These casual public contacts include “stopping by at the bar for a beer, getting advice from the grocer and giving advice to the newsstand man, comparing opinions with other customers at the bakery, etc.,” all of which serve to create “an almost unconscious assumption of general street support when the chips are down” (Jacobs 73). Jacobs admits that these contacts can’t “automatically overcome segregation and discrimination [because] too many other kinds of efforts are also required to right these injustices” (94). However, she writes, “to build and to rebuild big cities whose sidewalk[s] are unsafe…<em>can</em> make it <em>much harder</em> for American cities to overcome discrimination no matter how much effort is expended” (94, emphais, Jacobs''). While taking issue with her own suggestion, Jacobs concludes that seemingly trivial advancements actually lay the foundation for building a more integrated society.\n\nJacobs, who repeatedly stresses the benefits of positive sidewalk environments as opposed to more formal city social projects, objects to the use of projects similar to privately funded murals as a means of engendering that “feeling for the public identity of the people” (72), a feeling of sympathy for the general public which can’t be attained without informal public contact. However, her more basic assumption that, while the individual small steps taken towards social improvement may seem “utterly trivial,…the sum is not trivial at all” certainly lends credence to mural projects (73). Indeed, two positive outcomes, each consistent with hopes of unity and a shared public experience expressed by Jacobs, emerge from the creation of murals that depict unity and social harmony. First, the content of the murals—such as the mural in Soundview, which discounts the class divisions in our society—invokes and engenders a sense of social unity, thereby creating an almost subconscious collective feeling of brotherhood and equality. The images of leaders from different races, who played crucial roles in eliminating racial tensions, inspire us to develop a world in which these leaders’ values are expressed. Also inspiring are the messages contained in the murals calling for social action and community service. For example, the Soundview mural features the words, “I charge you to do something” (groundswellmural.org). Aside from the finished products, though, the process of creating the murals is itself an experience of racial amalgamation. On Groundswell’s website, photographs of mural painting often show diverse groups of young adults enjoying the experience. Indeed, Groundswell’s mission statement contains phrases such as “bring together” and “partnership”; the organization’s fundamental premise is that mural painting will “bridge cultural, ethnic, class and generational divides” (groundswellmural.org).\n\nHowever, the idea that minor aesthetic improvements to so-called “underrepresented” neighborhoods can make a significant social impact is more sentimental than realistic—as if the lack of political representation is more characteristic of these neighborhoods’ problems than, for example, poverty. While the murals certainly do help to beautify rundown neighborhoods and may encourage some of the public contact desired by Jacobs as well as foster a feeling of community, they actually amount to no more than what Didion, quoting William R. Taylor of SUNY Stony Brook, calls, “empathy without political compassion” (Didion 284). While presenting a large and noticeable façade of concern for communal socioeconomic misfortunes, these murals, like many of the components of the sentimental narrative that Didion mentions, divert our attention from finding effective, concrete solutions to enormous problems. While the concern that the murals portray may be genuine, it tends to be perceived as a substitution for or at least a crucial step towards social improvement. <em>A Daily News</em> article (2004) about the dedication ceremony of one of Groundswell’s mural projects in Brooklyn commemorating young victims of street violence cites several Brooklyn residents who describe the mural in grandiose terms. Jasmine, a 15-year-old girl who contributed to the mural said, “[I]t’s not just a picture…it’s a loss in our community…there’s too much violence, and it needs to stop.” One resident, Kevin Diaz, exclaimed, “I think that people will get a good moral out of this, that they should talk it out instead of using violence” (Hays). The idea that the mural isn’t “just a picture” and that people will learn valuable lessons from it affords these murals too much significance and doesn’t take into account the more basic issues of class and racial segregation.\n\nThe logical flaws that threaten to undermine Jacobs’s endorsement of “sidewalk contacts” as remedies to our social problems challenge the notion that murals make a difference in similar ways. For example, Jacobs’s assertion that “sidewalk public contact and sidewalk public safety…bear directly on…segregation and racial discrimination” and help to ameliorate problems of segregation seems implausible when considering the fact that the segregated races to which she refers don’t even share the same sidewalks to begin with (94). Similarly, creating murals in poor neighborhoods, while helping to beautify them, doesn’t help to bridge the racial and economic gaps that give birth to these neighborhoods in the first place.\n\nSome of the language employed in the murals and their titles also points to certain basic misconceptions on the part of the murals’ artists about their effectiveness. <em>We Are Here to Awaken from the Illusion of Our Separateness</em> is a striking example of the way in which murals use language to blur social divisions. Such misconceptions threaten to distract our society from facing socioeconomic problems head-on through the creation of better jobs for the poor and better public school education. By appealing to our senses, these murals also appeal to our sentimental notions of New York City as a melting pot, in which we all become “one community” whose differences are an illusion.\n\nSeveral blocks away from the mural about unity in Soundview there’s another mural, which in turn is several blocks away from where Amadou Diallo was shot. Jovino Borrero, the owner of a small shop in Soundview, commissioned an artist from Harlem to paint this mural in commemoration of Amadou Diallo in 2001 (Tran). However, this mural isn’t so sentimental or inspiring. It depicts 4 white policemen in white hoods and, next to a portrait of Amadou Diallo, the Statue of Liberty holding a gun. The effect of the mural is to suggest that the cause of Diallo’s murder was racial discrimination, and that this is what lies behind the country’s façade of liberty. This mural may be a more accurate portrayal than the more sentimental murals of the way in which Soundview residents view racial segregation and class divisions. While beautifying neighborhoods and fostering senses of unity and public identity are necessary projects, mural painting should not cloud our perception of the unfortunate reality in which we live, nor should it defer our search for realistic solutions that will help change that reality.\n<h2><strong>Appendix: Groundswell Murals</strong></h2>\n[caption id="attachment_95" align="alignright" width="665" caption="image001"]<img class="size-full wp-image-95 " title="image001" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image001.jpg" alt="image001" width="665" height="196" />[/caption]\n\n[caption id="attachment_343" align="alignright" width="171" caption="Figure 2"]<img class="size-full wp-image-343 " title="Figure 2" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Figure2.gif" alt="Figure 2" width="171" height="130" />[/caption]\n\n[caption id="attachment_83" align="alignright" width="171" caption="image007-728525"]<img class="size-full wp-image-83 " title="image007-728525" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image007-728525.jpg" alt="image007-728525" width="171" height="137" />[/caption]\n\n[caption id="attachment_87" align="alignright" width="395" caption="image004"]<img class="size-full wp-image-87 " title="image004" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image004.jpg" alt="image004" width="395" height="214" />[/caption]\n\n[caption id="attachment_86" align="alignright" width="673" caption="image005"]<img class="size-full wp-image-86 " title="image005" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image005.jpg" alt="image005" width="673" height="212" />[/caption]\n\n[caption id="attachment_99" align="alignright" width="257" caption="image012"]<img class="size-full wp-image-99 " title="image012" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image012.jpg" alt="image012" width="257" height="193" />[/caption]\n\n[caption id="attachment_82" align="alignright" width="333" caption="image007"]<img class="size-full wp-image-82 " title="image007" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image007.jpg" alt="image007" width="333" height="221" />[/caption]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-81" title="image008" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image008.jpg" alt="" width="244" height="429" />\n\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-78" title="image009" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image009.jpg" alt="" width="322" height="381" />\n\n<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-77" title="image010" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image010.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="208" />', 'Good Ole Murals for the Sentiments', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '283-autosave', '', '', '2012-03-01 15:57:09', '2012-03-01 15:57:09', '', 283, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?p=342', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Messages need to be archived.]</strong>\r\n\r\nDear Readers,\r\n\r\nThe essayist Randolph Bourne--a leftist intellectual and graduate of Columbia University''s class of 1905(?) rejected the possibility of young people writing meaningful essays. “The youthful essayist,” he wrote in the month before his death in 1918, “is afraid you will think he is unsophisticated, while the middle-aged doesn’t much care if you do. […] The youthful essayist usually develops into the professional anecdotalist, with an active mind that is harnessed up to no real thinking but can only stream off from itself a futile current of incident” (506). This is a strange—even a disheartening—sentiment to hear from Bourne, an essayist who never made it to sanguine middle age himself. He was writing, however, about the "light essay," a form of the essay that was epitomized by such well known writers as Charles Lamb. But Bourne, while insightful about many things, including the dangers of American thinkers tacitly approving the first World War, because they did not sufficiently consider what it asked us to rethink about democracy itself, was wrong about the essay. And Bourne also here fails to mention his own first attempts to do "real thinking" in essays in the Columbia Monthly, including articles on X, Y, and Z. If Bourne were a first year student at Columbia today, I would guess that he would be a prolific blogger, and would seek out as many opportunities for explorations of his ideas in public as he could.\r\n\r\nTo write an essay to an imagined (and actual) audience of smart readers who are not familiar with the particulars of the issues that concern oneself, but who can become interested by them is no small feat. To write both persuasively, thoughtfully, responsibly about questions about contemporary topics ranging from use of placebos trials to the complexity of drag performance, or the lasting effects of DADT despite its revocation situates the student writer as a person who can and should speak/write publicly on these issues--not to simply express his or her opinions, but to begin the heady process of entering into an existing intellectual conversation and exchange of ideas.\r\n\r\nThere is a genre called the essay which is particularly flexible and able to accomodate a wide range of subjects, writerly stances, aesthetic experiments and argumentative strategies. It is the essay''s diversity that this publication showcases and celebrates, although we do emphasize essays that make their arguments rather more explicitly than those on the more implicit and elliptical end of the spectrum.\r\n\r\nI am proud and fascinated of the work that students who are new to this form of writing have been able to accomplish with one semester''s worth of hard study of the genre''s requirements. And of all of what essay asks, it most demands that its writers show up and make their thinking visible to others on the page. This is no solipsistic act--the ideas are there because they are meaningful and could be meaningful to others.\r\n\r\nThe Core curriculum at Columbia includes many famous essayists on its curriculum, including both Michel de Montaigne and Francis Bacon. How fitting then that as students begin their study here that they might find a space to conduct their own experiments in thinking in the only course at Columbia that is required of all first year students: University Writing.\r\n\r\nAs you consider the essays in this journal, you might find it interesting to see how even the most timely of or students'' arguments--that respond to key controversies of their day--the Jessica Lynch story, the Borat movie, the RiceTek patenting case feature ideas that are of lasting interest and merit. This is why essays in the world continue to be read long after their timeliness--their kairotic appeals--diminish: because in the presence of a thinker working carefully to craft an idea about a text well known or just discovered, we feel the thrill of a moment of invention. In essays these moments are not preserved or fixed but recreated, and the force of the best essays by writers regardless of their age is that of the click--the idea that was nascent and only dimmly detected made visible and sharable with others. The art of the essay is alive and well at Columbia and we look forward to many more volumes of The Morningside Review to show us of what new essaysists in our midsts can contribute to the form.\r\n\r\nWith all best wishes,\r\nNicole B.

(345, 8, '2012-03-23 15:08:59', '2012-03-23 15:08:59', 'David Cronenberg began his career by making B horror films but later transcended the genre, creating gruesome, highly physical melodramas. One of the ways he has made this transition so smoothly is through the motif of sadomasochism, in which violence is directed at an objectified female. In watching Cronenberg films like <em>Videodrome, Crash, Dead Ringers, and A History of Violence</em>, it is easy to interpret one’s horror as an indication of the director’s offensive ideology. But one must also consider the possibility of a director distancing himself from his dramatic material through the use of horror techniques, and encouraging the viewer to do the same: a possibility that becomes clear through an investigation of the work of Laura Mulvey, one of film theory’s most prominent feminists.\n\nIn her essay, <em>Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema</em>, Mulvey discusses the cinematic convention of the objectified female and the man as the bearer of the look. She proposes that since the male protagonist directs the gaze of the spectator through subjective narration, mainstream Hollywood encourages the audience to identify with his voyeurism. She also claims that implicit in the voyeur-exhibitionist relationship between the male protagonist and the female lead is a sadomasochistic fantasy that is never explicitly realized: “The power to subject another person to the will sadistically or to the gaze voyeuristically is turned on to the woman as the object of both” (845). Because the Hollywood female lead is placed in a submissive role, film has not only reflected the sexism in society but also perpetuated it, affirming women’s submissive role in society. She identifies this problem through the use of Hitchcock films as an emblem of mainstream Hollywood misogyny, and she defines sadomasochism as the use of pain to enhance sexual pleasure in both the inflictor and the recipient.\n\nMulvey calls for a new subversive film language to destroy these misogynist pleasures of spectatorship by provoking the viewer to analyze the look of the camera. She writes, “The first blow against the monolithic accumulation of traditional film conventions (already undertaken by radical filmmakers) is to free the look of the camera into its materiality in time and space” (847). In other words, subversive filmmakers would need to eliminate the technique commonly referred to in film editing as the “eyeline match,” in which a character’s gaze is intercut with the subject of the gaze. This would free the look of the camera from the subjective look of the protagonist, and thereby heighten the audience’s awareness of the camera’s presence within the diegesis. Awareness enables analysis, which is the key to the destruction of pleasure. As Mulvey herself puts it: “analyzing pleasure, or beauty destroys it” (839), and “destruction of pleasure is a radical weapon” (838). Voyeurism, defined as the pleasurable illusion of looking in on a private world, would thus be destroyed through analysis.\n\nDavid Cronenberg achieves this same feat of destruction through slightly different means. He does not eliminate the eyeline match, nor does he avoid subjective narration. Whereas Mulvey talks about freeing “the look of the camera into its materiality,” Cronenberg frees the look of the male protagonist into its physical manifestations through the depiction of sadomasochism between the male protagonist and the female lead. Since Mulvey herself admits that the look of the spectator and the look of the male protagonist are intricately intertwined in the conventional narrative system to which Cronenberg adheres, Cronenberg’s subversion of Hollywood misogyny is in fact quite similar to Mulvey’s. Cronenberg’s films do provoke analysis of the nature of voyeuristic pleasure, as Mulvey urges, and this analysis has already had a destructive impact on that pleasure. There is then a possibility that Mulvey fails to acknowledge in her essay, namely that filmmakers can subvert the very techniques they use—that they can express ambivalence toward their own artistic tradition.\n\nBoth Mulvey and Cronenberg seem to feel that materiality or physicality makes film-going a more candid act. Cronenberg’s film Crash, from 1996, depicts a scenario in which a growing cult seeks sexual gratification through vehicular accidents. The male protagonist, a TV director, stumbles upon this subculture while trying to rejuvenate his sex life with his wife. In his article regarding that film, entitled, “A Vision of Masochism in the Affective Pain of Crash,” Anthony McCosker writes, “<em>Crash</em> explores new ways of corporealizing sexuality, bringing sexuality back to bodily experience” (43). Feminist film theorist Mary Ann Doane would not find this surprising: “It is precisely because the [female] body has been a major site of oppression that perhaps it must be the site of the battle to be waged” (384). If this is true, we can confidently say that Cronenberg heads straight for the battleground. But has he stumbled upon this battleground by chance? Or does his work have some purpose, some sociopolitical impact beyond entertainment?\n\nIn the film <em>Videodrome</em>, a new type of pornographic broadcast is discovered emanating from Pittsburgh in which people are beaten, tortured, and electrocuted in a bare room with clay walls. The broadcast is known as videodrome, and it catches the attention of protagonist Max Ren, who seeks to introduce it onto his channel, and his love interest Nikki, who wants to star on the show. Professor Brian Oblivion, a character in the film, claims, “The battle for the mind of North America will be fought in the video arena: the videodrome.” Since that is the title of the film itself, we can infer that Cronenberg realizes he is engaged in a battle “for the mind,” despite his perverse focus on the body. He clearly intends to fight, so which side is he fighting for: the pleasures of patriarchal society, or the destruction of those pleasures?\n\nBefore we can say for sure, it is necessary to compare Cronenberg’s films to Mulvey’s analyses films by Alfred Hitchcock. Mulvey examines Hitchcock’s films <em>Vertigo, Rear Window</em>, and <em>Marnie</em> through the lens of Freudian theory in order to demonstrate mainstream Hollywood misogyny as expressed through voyeuristic sadomasochism. By making this sadomasochism obvious to the viewer unschooled in Freud, Cronenberg enables more viewers to reach the same conclusions as Mulvey.\n\nFor example, in Hitchcock’s<em> Rear Window</em>, a crippled photojournalist spies on his neighbors from his apartment window and becomes convinced that the man across the courtyard has murdered his wife. The male protagonist’s voyeuristic tendencies are established by the fact that he is a photographer. The female lead’s exhibitionism is established by her obsessive interest in dress and style. The male protagonist comments on her expensive dress, but only to mock its excess. In <em>Videodrome</em>, the male protagonist practically psychoanalyzes the female lead’s dress, saying, “That dress. It’s very stimulating. It’s red. I mean, you know what Freud would have said about that dress.” The female lead replies, “And he would have been right.” Whereas the voyeur/exhibitionist relationship in Hitchcock relies on Mulvey’s psychoanalysis to be discerned by the typical viewer, Cronenberg does the psychoanalysis for us.\n\nSimilarly, while Mulvey interprets the motivation behind the male protagonist’s sadomasochistic desires as the female’s embodiment of the male’s “castration threat,” Cronenberg depicts that threat literally (Mulvey 837). In fact, the female lead in<em>Videodrome</em>, indirectly through her alliance with videodrome, causes the male protagonist to literally and physically grow a vagina that also functions somewhat like a VCR. There’s no need for Freud—the castration threat has been made real (see Fig.1):\n\n[caption id="attachment_320" align="alignright" width="720" caption="Figure 1"]<img class="size-full wp-image-320 " title="Figure 1" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image001.gif" alt="Figure 1" width="720" height="405" />[/caption]\n\nThe implicit sadomasochism that Mulvey discerns in this type of relationship is also made plain to the viewer. Mulvey writes of the female lead of Hitchcock’s <em>Vertigo</em>, “Her exhibitionism, her masochism, make her an ideal passive counterpart to Scottie’s [the male protagonist] active sadistic voyeurism” (846). Yet spectators who have not read Freud might not be able to discern the misogynist message of this sadomasochism because it is not enacted literally and materially. In <em>Videodrome</em>, the male protagonist watches the female lead on a television screen, making the voyeuristic nature of the relationship material. He then proceeds to whip the television screen with her image on it, making the sadomasochistic nature of the relationship material. The scene suggests that, like the male protagonist who directs our gaze, we are in some way violating the female lead by watching her voyeuristically on a screen. In the image below, taken from<em>Videodrome</em>, the male protagonist kisses a voyeuristically objectified image of the female lead (see Figure 2).\n\n[caption id="attachment_319" align="alignright" width="515" caption="Figure 2"]<img class="size-full wp-image-319 " title="Figure 2" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image004.gif" alt="Figure 2" width="515" height="371" />[/caption]\n\nTania Modleski writes in her essay, “The Women Who Knew Too Much: Hitchcock and Feminist Theory”:\n<blockquote>In Hitchcock’s films, women’s purses (and their jewelry) take on a vulgar Freudian significance relating to female sexuality and to men’s attempts to investigate it. One might think, for example, of the purse in the opening closeup shot of Marnie that contains Marnie’s ‘identity’ cards and the booty of her theft from patriarchy. (854)</blockquote>\nThe average spectator, however, would probably see merely a purse—not, as Modleski supposes, a guilty vagina. Hitchcock’s films generally served as mainstream genre pictures, and most viewers probably wanted to be entertained more than they wanted to crack the Freudian code. Cronenberg, on the other hand, makes the Freudian significance of the male protagonist’s voyeuristic investigation exceedingly obvious; there’s no need to decode.\n\nIn his 1988 film <em>Dead Ringers</em>, about two identical twins sharing the same office, apartment, and women, the male protagonists are gynecologists and the female lead is not only an actress (an obvious occupation for an exhibitionist), but more importantly his patient. When we first meet the female lead, she is subjected to the male protagonist’s incriminating gaze in the most physical of ways. She lies in his office with her legs open and the male protagonist peering into her vagina. He tells her she has a defect, and later they engage in sadomasochistic sex in which she is tied to a bed with medical tubes. The female lead cries, “You’re gonna spank me, doc. I’ve been bad, and I need to be punished.” It is as though her physical defect is deserving of punishment in the same way as Marnie’s psychological defect (her kleptomania), which is physically manifested only through the metaphor of the purse. The sadomasochism in Cronenberg’s films therefore reveals the Freudian implications of the relationship between the male protagonist and female lead to the viewer unfamiliar with Freud’s ideas.\n\nMoreover, because Cronenberg’s films point out the sadomasochistic nature of cinema itself, we are labeled as participants in such events, an idea rarely acknowledged by most moviegoers. Jean-Francois Lyotard writes of the corporeality of cinema in his essay, “The Unconscious as Mise-en-scene”: “It is the transcribing on and for bodies, considered as multi-sensory potentialities, which is the work characteristic of the mise-en-scene… The idea of performance…seems linked to the idea of inscription on the body” (88). It is as though moviegoers seek to be acted upon physically in some way, to have their bodies altered. Yet it is unlikely that most film spectators have read Jean-Francois Lyotard. Such a theory would be unnecessary when applied to a Cronenberg film, which has the psychoanalysis already built into the narrative. For example, in Videodrome, watching television induces a brain tumor in Professor Oblivion, and eventually persuades the male protagonist to shoot himself, exclaiming, “long live the new flesh.” Lyotard’s analysis of cinema as closely linked to the body, if applied to Videodrome, might seem trite and even understated.\n\nCronenberg’s films also point out ways in which artists like Hitchcock sadistically exploit women for voyeuristic entertainment. For example, Hitchcock casts beautiful, voluptuous women as the female leads so that they can be gazed at by the audience through the eyes of the male protagonist. Cronenberg points out the perverse sadomasochism implicit in such an artistic choice. In the film <em>Crash</em>, for example, one character says, “I want really big tits so the audience can see them get all cut up and crushed on the dashboard.” In Hitchcock films, we go to the cinema in order to voyeuristically violate the female lead. In Cronenberg films, the female lead’s violation is physical. In<em> Dead Ringers</em>, when the male protagonist has gone insane, he invents torture instruments which he calls “gynecological instruments for mutant women.” An artist who owns a gallery displays these misogynist sadomasochistic devices in a way that evokes the way Hitchcock panders to spectators by violating his female leads (see Figure 3).\n\n[caption id="attachment_318" align="alignright" width="500" caption="Figure 3"]<a href="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image007.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-318 " title="Figure 3" src="http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image007.gif" alt="Figure 3" width="500" height="295" /></a>[/caption]\n\nBut since Cronenberg is doing the same things as Hitchcock, isn’t he just part of the same problem identified by Mulvey? As Janet Maslin wrote in her review of <em>Videodrome</em>for the <em>New York Times</em>, “There are times when it is dangerously unclear, in the midst of Max’s lurid, sadomasochistic fantasies, whether Videodrome is far removed from the kind of sensationalism it seeks to satirize” (Maslin). Movie critic James Bowman, in his article, “On Sex and Violence,” criticizes Cronenberg and other directors such as David Lynch when he says, “Are they, by an amazing stroke of irony, actually ridiculing the sex-and-violence connection they are ostensibly promoting? No, probably not” (64). It is possible, though doubtful, that Cronenberg is not trying to make cinematic sadomasochism so unpalatable that we reject it in all its forms.\n\nYet even if Cronenberg is not ridiculing the sex-and-violence connection, even if he is promoting it on the screen, he is probably only doing so to prevent it in real life. The main character of <em>Videodrome</em>, Max Ren, chooses programming for his pornography channel for a living, presenting hidden urges to the public in a way that parallels David Cronenberg’s role as a director. As Max Ren puts it, “Better on TV than in the streets.” According to such logic, enacting these fantasies on screen prevents the viewer from enacting them in real life.\n\nSo perhaps for those who are attracted to the type of relationship Mulvey finds so disgustingly misogynist, Cronenberg also serves a more socially positive role than Hitchcock. In Hitchock’s <em>Marnie</em>, a sexually frigid man-hating habitual thief called Marnie marries the man who catches her in exchange for his silence to the authorities. On one occasion, the male protagonist says to the female lead, “I’m fighting a powerful impulse to beat the hell out of you.” The male protagonist manages to beat that impulse; perhaps as a result, the sadomasochist spectator is denied the ability to satisfy his violent urges vicariously through the male protagonist. The viewer is allowed to experience voyeuristic sadomasochism, but that is not fulfilling enough, because it would probably not be physical enough for a self-identified sadomasochist.\n\nBecause the Cronenberg protagonist barely fights the impulse to “beat the hell out of” the female lead, we are allowed to experience the same rush that the male protagonist feels. As Professor Oblivion says, “Whatever appears on the video screen emerges as raw experience for those who watch it. The hallucination can therefore act as a substitute for reality.” And according to another character in <em>Videodrome</em>, “You don’t have to actually hurt anybody. You just have to think about it.” This kind of dialogue supports the notion that even if Cronenberg is not far removed from the kind of sensationalism he seeks to satirize—even if he is a panderer like Hitchcock—he still aims to perform a socially positive act.\n\nYet the majority of us don’t have sadomasochist urges, or if we do, we derive more horror than pleasure from them. It is this “mainstream” audience member that ought to be the main target in Cronenberg’s war against the misogynist cinematic vocabulary of mainstream Hollywood. Because Cronenberg not only acknowledges but explores the grotesque physicality of Hitchcock’s sadomasochism, he lays his perversions out on the table, which makes them far more accessible to the viewer unschooled in Freud. Hitchcock was popular for his ability to satisfy his audience’s urges. For the sadomasochist, perhaps, Cronenberg plays a similar role.\n\nBut Cronenberg makes most “normal” viewers so disgusted and ashamed of these urges that for many it is difficult to “like” a Cronenberg film. As Roger Ebert wrote regarding <em>Crash</em>, “I admired it, although I cannot say I ‘liked’ it” (“Crash”). His feelings toward Dead Ringers are similar: “It’s the kind of movie where you ask people how they liked it, and they say, ‘well, it was well made,’ and then they wince” (“Dead Ringers”). Anthony McCosker writes, “Often manifesting as outrage and discomfort, the unsettling spectatorial experience of <em>Crash</em> is far from empty” (45). He also summarizes the critical response at large: “Reviews in news media around the world reiterated the moral outrage expressed in the British news media” (38). When the film was screened at Cannes, some attendants fled the theater in protest, horror, or a combination of both. The film was even banned for a period of time in Great Britain.\n\nMonohla Dargis attempts to explain these types of reactions in her review of the 2005 Cronenberg film, <em>A History of Violence</em>. In that film, a humble family man’s transformation into a local hero through a brutal act of “heroism” causes a chain of violent repercussions and forces him to defend his family while attempting to restore peace and order into their lives. The film traces the protagonist’s effort to grapple and subdue the violent impulses within himself that arise in the wake of his heroic deed. In one scene, the male protagonist loses control and rapes his wife on a wooden staircase. She writes, “The great kick of the movie—or rather its great kick in the gut—comes from Mr. Cronenberg’s refusal to let us indulge in movie violence without paying a price” (Dargis). Botting and Wilson provide a similar explanation for viewers’ responses to Cronenberg in their essay “Automatic Lovers”: “Crash refuses to evoke or simulate the sensational and spectacular effects that one would expect from a film that draws an equivalence between sex and car crashes” (189). That both reviews speak of some sort of “refusal” on Cronenberg’s part—the refusal to indulge, the refusal to sensationalize—is significant. Essentially, he is refusing to pander to our expectations for sanitized sadomasochism and sanitized misogyny, expectations which directors like Hitchcock catered to by expressing our urges through voyeurism and purses, metaphors for much deeper and more physical perversions. Cronenberg refuses to let us ignore the sickness in these ostensibly sanitized films, and more importantly, the sickness in ourselves as viewers of those films. Roger Ebert describes the relationship between Cronenberg and the sanitization of mainstream Hollywood quite clearly:\n<blockquote>Take out the crashes and the injuries, and substitute the usual romantic movie story line, and it would be easy to understand this progression. For the first crash, substitute a chance meeting at a party. Have the husband make a fool of himself. Have them meet later by chance. Have them survive a dangerous experience. Let them feel sudden sexual attraction. No one in the audience would bat an eye if there was then a sex scene. (“Crash”)</blockquote>\nAdverse reactions are key to provoking debate, says Anthony McCosker: “The media event of Crash, then, affords the chance to rethink the general notion of sadomasochistic sexuality in terms of a more concerted examination of masochism… as mass media experience” (31, emphasis mine). Similarly, he argues that “this film and the media events that encompass it have provided a site for an encounter with the corporeal specificity of masochistic sexuality” (37, emphasis mine). We can therefore gather that Cronenberg’s film has allowed us to consider masochism in mass media as a corporeal event.\n\nIt seems, then, as though Laura Mulvey’s predictions have been proven correct, though in a slightly different way than she intended. She hoped to make the sadistic gaze of the camera more material and more obvious to the viewer by perhaps allowing the figures onscreen to acknowledge the presence of the camera and the spectator. After all, voyeurism depends on a one-way dominant gaze. Mary Ann Doane explains, “If a character looks at and speaks to the spectator, this constitutes an acknowledgment that the character is seen and heard in a radically different space and is therefore generally read as transgressive” (378). Yet in <em>Videodrome</em>, the female lead often looks at and speaks to the male protagonist when he watches her on television, the effect of which is indeed quite jarring. These instances are symptomatic of a more general attempt on Cronenberg’s part to make us aware of the protagonist’s gaze and to materialize it into physical sadomasochism rather than voyeuristic sadomasochism. As predicted by Mulvey and pointed out by McCosker, the effect of this materialization is an awareness that provides an opportunity for analysis. Furthermore, as Mulvey and various other critics like Roger Ebert suggest, this analysis leads to the destruction of pleasure. This approach, described by Ebert in his review of <em>Dead Ringers</em> as “the objectivity of a scientist” (“Dead Ringers”), is far different from the usual romanticization of voyeuristic sadomasochism in mainstream Hollywood. In Rear Window, for example, the diegetic soundtrack consists mainly of a love song that the female lead claims “sounds like it’s being written just for us.” Cronenberg is just as much of a voyeur as Hitchcock, but unlike Hitchcock he manages to subvert the very techniques he employs.\n\n&nbsp;', 'David Cronenberg: The Voyeur of Utter Destruction', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '280-autosave', '', '', '2012-03-23 15:08:59', '2012-03-23 15:08:59', '', 280, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?p=345', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
(346, 8, '2012-03-23 15:15:33', '2012-03-23 15:15:33', 'Universal truth is an outdated concept. Traditional philosophers explained reality through a single system of precepts which, though often abstracted to the point of meaninglessness, provided the singular satisfaction of complete and absolute truth. Modern thinkers are skeptical of such grand unifying theories. To them there is no one objective vision of reality, only various perspectives, all equally valid and limited.\n\nWendy Doniger applies this pluralism to the concept of identity. In her essay, ???Many Masks, Many Selves,??? she discusses various historical figures, from the ???acting President??? Ronald Reagan (62) to the notorious transvestite Chevalier d???Eon (64), whose public masks were so tangled with their private personae that the ostensibly objective self became nebulous. From this Doniger concludes that there is no fundamental self, rather ???a polythetic clustering of resembling selves??? sufficient to create an enduring sense of self??? (70). The absence of an absolute identity does not trouble her though, as it validates a plurality of masks. This relativism is liberating in a world that demands many identities, allowing a career woman to change from doting mother, to cutthroat capitalist, to sultry temptress without undermining any of her masks (68). Freed from the obsolete notion of the soul, Pluralistic Man defines himself as he wills.\n\nThe Underground Man, the anti-hero of Fyodor Dostoevsky???s novel <em>Notes from the Underground</em>, is the epitome of Doniger???s personality masquerader. Throughout the novel, the Underground Man deliberately assumes identities ranging from debauched aristocrat (99) to radical social critic (122), culminating in his stirring sermon on vice and redemption to an enraptured prostitute, which is ultimately revealed as a cynical intellectual self-indulgence with no true pathos (144). He takes Doniger???s advice to ???wear as many [masks] as possible, realize that we are wearing them, and try to find out what each one concerns and reveals??? (70). Yet it is this very realization of the mask that undermines his masquerade. His awareness of the contradiction of his masks does not ???allow paradox to thrive??? (Doniger 70), rather it reveals the phoniness of his personae and his terrible disconnection from his true self, in which Dostoevsky, unlike Doniger, fervently believes (201). Dostoevsky employs the Underground Man to prove that the individual who ???knows thyself??? cannot comfortably wear Doniger???s masks.\n\nThe vestment of the sanctimonious is the most uncomfortable mask for the self-perceptive man because the honest preacher, constantly aware of his own sins, hesitates to cast the first stone. Dostoevsky demonstrates this with the Underground Man???s failed speech during the goodbye dinner of Zverkov (119-120), a successful army office and former school mate. The protagonist prefaces this episode by describing his childhood jealousy and hatred of Zverkov, a typical aristocratic philistine blessed with beauty, moral indifference, and social graces (95). This last attribute particularly vexes the Underground Man, as that is what he lacks and longs for most. To prove his moral superiority and disdain he decides to don the smirking mask of satire and interrupt the dinner with a diatribe that will shatter Zverkov???s conceit. In the middle of his philippic, though, he is struck by the hypocrisy of his cynicism. After all, he invited himself to the dinner originally out of a vain attempt to ingratiate himself with the very men whose vanity he is attacking. Crippled by this revelation, his tirade trickles into confused and sentimental rambling, which only fuels his opponents??? contempt (124).\n\nSeen through the lens of Doniger???s infinite selves, the Underground Man???s moralizing is defensible. His supposedly sinful true self is no more fundamental than the righteous persona he adopts, so the latter is not hypocritical, but merely different. A pluralistic self that wears conflicting masks is no more duplicitous than a single actor who plays separate conflicting parts in the same eternal play.\n\nDoniger???s carefree possessors of antithetical ethics are acknowledged by Dostoevsky. He longingly describes the ???rogue [who] can be absolutely and loftily honest at heart without in the least ceasing to be a rogue??? (72). Yet such innocence is limited to those who have ???a faculty??? for the most contradictory sensations??? (71): i.e. the unreflective layman. The perceptive man???s visceral aversion to conscious hypocrisy cannot be assuaged by an intellectual recognition of the plurality of self. Doniger???s ???Venn diagram??? (70) of selves is as ???Zen??? (70) as she describes, in that it can only be achieved through unthinking.\n\nThe self-aware individual???s comprehension of the artificial source of his mask inhibits his ability to naturally masquerade, as Dostoevsky exhibits again with his hapless protagonist. In a surge of anger, after being humiliated at the dinner party, the Underground Man imagines an elaborate revenge involving an honorable dual, years of stoic suffering in Siberia, and finally a climactic confrontation with the grand perpetrator, Zverkov, whom the Christ-like hero magnanimously forgives, attaining absolute moral revenge (130-131). The integrity of this mask of righteous anger is quickly undermined, however, by the Underground Man''s understanding that the entire revenge fantasy is merely a trite rehashing of plots lifted from Pushkin and Lermontov (131).\n\nDoniger agrees that masks are typically appropriated from art, as in Reagan???s channeling of his WWII film hero past to enhance the verisimilitude of his Normandy speech (62). The externality of such masks does not bother her though, as she denies the existence of a wholly internal mask. ???We are never ourselves to ourselves, but always in relation to others??? (Doniger 67), so the difference between the Underground Man quoting Pushkin versus Pushkin???s original exhortations themselves is just a matter of degree.\n\nTo Dostoevsky though, this matter of degree is crucial because the wearer of the mask is conscious of it. All ideas may be necessarily external because they are ultimately an amalgamation of reactions to others??? ideas, but they do not immediately appear so to their conceivers, even those who are perceptive. Conversely, when the Underground Man copies directly from Pushkin, since art is artificial by default, he is unavoidably aware that he is uttering artifice. Again, the confidence of the masquerader is determined by his awareness of the masquerade, not the theoretical validity of the mask.\n\nA mask worn in its proper scene can appear as authentic as Doniger desires; during the transition between scenes though, the absurdity is naked. Dostoevsky illustrates this with the Underground Man???s final interaction with Liza, the aforementioned prostitute. The penitent harlot comes to his house seeking the holy man who had lectured her on sin. Although her savior begins his address appropriately, sanctimoniously extolling his humble abode, he is soon distracted by his hated manservant and starts squabbling with him over some petty misdeed. Pathos turns to bathos, and the Underground Man is reminded once more of the silliness of his masks. Note that moral hypocrisy is not the issue here. The manservant may have deserved a tongue lashing as much as Liza merited more flowery words. It is the awkward juxtaposition that undermines each persona.\n\nThis damning disparity is not just apparent during abrupt switches. No matter how brief and fluid the transition, the perceptive individual will always note the momentary non sequitur. Even Doniger???s model career woman, coming home from a day of merciless layoffs to bake cookies for her children, would be disquieted by the contrast of her masks.\n\nBoth Doniger and Dostoevsky have their consolations. Doniger does not believe in a single fundamental identity, but effectively replaces it with her conception of the pluralistic self. Dostoevsky denies the feasibility of this pluralistic self, but believes in an ultimate authentic identity: a soul. Although the Underground Man may have lost his soul through ???lack of fitting environment, through divorce from real life, and rankling spite,??? (201) his <em>Notes</em> serve as ???corrective punishment??? (201) for himself, the reader, and perhaps even the author, urging them to avoid his mistakes and return to their real selves (210-203). When viewed through each other???s lenses though, these consolations cancel out. The Pluralistic Underground Man can neither blithely exchange masks, nor piously pursue the sacred aspiration of the non-existent true self. He is the tragic archetype of modernity: Mastery of reasoning has allowed him to penetrate the mind???s substrata of comforting delusions and fantasies, only to find nothing beneath. Doniger optimistically assures him that ???as we strip away masks, or faces, each time we see more in the hall of looking glasses??? (70).

It is far better viewed as a weltanschauung that has been actualized, translated into the material realm—a world view transformed into an objective force." —Guy Debord</blockquote>\nThe industrial-flaw detector, a machine mechanics and engineers use to test the quality of a metal without destroying it, acquired a novel role in the 1950s when a Scottish professor of midwifery applied the machine''s probe to a patient''s abdomen and visualized the pelvic mass with objectivity that standard palpation could not muster. After years of experiments with the innovation, the obstetric ultrasound was born, allowing doctors and patients to see through the barrier of the patient''s flesh to unveil "a body within a body... a developing fetus within a womb" (Tansey i). The procedure of imaging the fetus has since become standard in modern obstetric care for reasons both medical and cultural (Taylor 17). Part of the ultrasound''s initial broad social appeal had to do with its capacity to "increase a woman''s awareness of the fetus," which in turn had a positive influence on the pregnant woman''s compliance with prenatal care (Taylor 19, Fletcher 392). More specifically, "since images are apparently thought to make more of an impression upon women''s minds than words (of explanation, advice, or persuasion), it has become possible to understand ''psychological benefits'' as a medical side effect of obstetrical ultrasound" (Taylor 20). The technology, first used to test the integrity of industrial structures, now makes visible the physical <em>and maternal</em> integrity of the pregnant woman.\n\nTo consider improved prenatal care a "psychological benefit" of ultrasound implies that a woman is insufficiently aware of the salient qualities of a fetus (specifically, her fetus) without an ultrasound. This assumption has played an important role in the development of informed consent standards for induced abortion. Particularly, the 1992 Supreme Court ruling in <em>Planned Parenthood v. Casey</em> permitted a regulatory framework that has deeply influenced standards of consent. In <em>Casey</em>, the court upheld several provisions of a Pennsylvania statute that imposed restrictions upon women seeking an abortion. The act specified that a woman must be provided with precise information at least one day before the procedure. If a minor, she must obtain parental consent, and if married, must inform her husband of her choice. Additionally, the law restricted the situational judgment of abortion providers. The court, while admitting that "our obligation is to define the liberty of all, not mandate our own moral code," found that most of the provisions were constitutional so long as their burdens upon the pregnant woman were in balance with "the State''s profound interest in potential life" (505 U.S. 833). Consistent with the notion that a woman''s knowledge of the nature of gestation is somehow lacking, the court reasoned that "though the woman has a right to choose to terminate or continue her pregnancy before viability, it does not at all follow that the State is prohibited from taking steps to ensure that this choice is thoughtful and informed" (505 U.S. 833).\n\nThe legal and ethical doctrine of informed consent encourages persons undergoing medical procedures to make an "evaluative choice of which of the available courses of actions is better or best" (Savulescu 17). Information about the procedure ought to "enable an understanding of the true nature of the actions in question and their consequences" (ibid). While informed consent standards for abortion vary by state, the obstetric ultrasound is frequently a consideration. At present, fourteen states regulate ultrasound access in facilities that provide abortions (Guttmacher 1). Of these, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana require that all women seeking an abortion undergo an ultrasound and be offered the opportunity to view the image. Two other states share this provision once the pregnancy has reached the second trimester. The remaining require that the abortion provider offer the woman a chance to see the images only in cases in which an ultrasound is medically indicated, or upon her request (ibid). As lawyer Charles Trense notes in <em>Law and Psychology Review</em>, the requirements are considered "in keeping with the regulatory framework approved of in Casey," because they provide the woman with information about the nature of the fetus (231). Since the "impact on the fetus is ''relevant, if not dispositive,'' to the decision," it is conceivable to Trense that "a pregnant woman would want to view the fetus as it currently existed before deciding the impact of terminating its existence" (237).\n\nWhat does the inclusion of fetal imaging in the informed consent process mean for those whom the provisions are intended to protect, namely, women seeking abortions? Images have become the criterion of truth in modernity. Accordingly, they have the power to change one''s perception of reality. As author Susan Sontag points out in her essay "Looking at War," "photographs... are themselves a species of rhetoric. They reiterate. They simplify. They agitate. They create the illusion of consensus" (Sontag 82). To illustrate, Sontag examines images of "mangled bodies of adults and children" that represent the consequences of armed conflict, reflecting that "they show how war evacuates, shatters, breaks apart, levels the built world" (Sontag 82). They also persuade. The abortion debate is a social war, and its outcome is a function of the consensus as to when life begins. The images appropriated by those who seek to excoriate abortion via the sonogram do just the opposite of what Sontag''s images do. They show intact bodies of embryos and fetuses. They show that what the physician evacuates from the uterus is whole, continuous, preparing for membership in the "built world." This rhetoric effectively changes the way the viewer, particularly the pregnant woman, perceives herself and her status as either an individual or as an incubator of future life. The images attempt to persuade in favor of one "version of reality" or another, in favor of fetal personhood at either conception, or viability, or birth (Hopkins 395). Depending on the reading, the image potentially pits the rights of the mother against the rights of the fetus. Is such a task the domain of an informed consent protocol?\n\nCharles Trense is not alone in his view that the sonogram persuades in favor of fetal rights. For instance, Stuart Cambell, developer of the three- and four- dimensional obstetric ultrasound that has made possible unprecedented views of the maternal body, has admitted an agenda beyond providing expectant families with the opportunity to bond with their future child before birth (Savell 106). Campaigning in England for a narrower timeframe during which a woman may chose to abort, Campbell has declared that the fetal features and behavior he has witnessed through ultrasound have caused him to "believe we have no right to be killing the foetus that is capable of them" (Savell 107). If the ultrasound removes a barrier to the pregnant woman''s understanding of the consequences of her actions, it may also influence the intuitions of others who view the images. The ultrasound makes us all privy to the intimate events of gestation. Trense articulates the conclusion of those who believe that the fetal image does confirm fetal personhood when he contends that "those who seek an abortion may be so moved by the deeply personal, revealing experience afforded by sonogram imagery" that not only will they choose to carry the fetus to term, they may also advocate for more widespread access to the technology (240). Indeed, he feels that "a sonogram requirement" (note that he is speaking of the<em>requirement</em>, not simply the sonogram) "equips a woman with the tools to make her own decision as to when life begins" (ibid).\n\nIn opposition to the sonogram requirement, the Guttmacher Institute, a research group focused on global reproductive health, notes that "routine ultrasound is not considered medically necessary as a component of first-trimester abortion" (1). As such, "the requirements appear to be a veiled attempt to personify the fetus and dissuade a woman from obtaining an abortion" (1). The kind of information the ultrasound purportedly conveys—evidence of the physical, anthropomorphic features of the fetus—is arguably an appeal to social instincts. Specifically, it is an appeal to the social expectations for maternal behavior—behavior motivated by emotions and instincts—and thus, it actually precludes the opportunity for logical assessment, the very sort of reasoning informed consent is meant to foster.\n\nScholars have actively considered how ultrasound is used as a social practice as much as it is used a source of medical information. In particular, medical sociologist and professor of psychology Nick Hopkins has carried out extensive research on collective social behavior surrounding pregnancy. Analyzing the use of emotional rhetoric in abortion politics, he proposes that "the categorization of the fetus is dependent upon the significance attributed to the similarities and differences between fetuses and persons" (402). In other words, the recognition (or lack of recognition) of human features either bolsters or reduces the perceived reality of fetal\nUWP 2009-2010 (3) personhood. Further, studies of ultrasound procedures in planned pregnancies suggest that the ultrasound image is not informative in itself, but rather is imbued with meaning through societal expectations and the social activity of creating a family (Hopkins 396, Savell, 106). The image''s meaning "is not straightforward or given, but is a product of the viewing practices through which [it] is consumed" (Hopkins 395). In this way, fetal personhood is, as Valerie Hartouni states, "not a ''property'' that can or will be ''discovered'' with greater scientific knowledge or increased technological capabilities, but is produced in and through the very practices that claim merely to ''reveal'' it" (qtd. in Hopkins 395). Conclusions about personhood may hinge on objective facts that the sonogram makes evident, but the inferences drawn from these facts and the analysis of their significance are inseparable from the emotionally and socially charged context through which the information is read.\n\nCertainly, not everyone views fetal personhood as a matter of social consensus. Those who favor including ultrasound in the informed consent process suggest that the individual woman should "make her own decision as to when life begins" (Trense 240). However, the very suggestion admits that the empirical signal of a life''s commencement is determined ad hoc, or is at least unclear. Anti-abortion rhetoric asserts that authoritative, medical tools <em>prove</em> fetal personhood. Religious and metaphysical arguments, having not achieved the desired prohibition of abortion, are "superseded by the objective claims of science" (Boucher 9). In other words, the strongest claims in this emotional debate will be objective ones, and if there is truth to the privileged ontological status of the fetus, it will have to be proven in scientific terms through medical technology. Proponents of moralizing sonograms attempt to make the authority of science work in collusion with the accessibility of the image to persuade the woman and society that the "baby" the woman hosts has a right to life. Medical imagery buttresses the logic of fetal personhood. After all, "a photograph is supposed not to evoke but to show" (Sontag 90).\n\nThe jump from impartial science to the social privileges of the fetus finds articulation in a pro-life pamphlet that accuses physicians of "violating a woman''s right to know what is going on inside her body when they turn the screen away during a scan of her unborn child" (Hopkins 401). Notice the way the biological facts of gestation, "what is going on inside her body," are neatly juxtaposed with the socialization of the fetus, replaced here with the "unborn child." The pamphlet concludes that "the mother should be encouraged to face reality" (ibid). But whose reality? Surely, the one constructed by those members of society already persuaded of the fetus'' personhood.\n\nParallel to this image-based condemnation of abortion, Sontag considers the arguments exchanged by a pair of anti-war correspondents regarding photographs of wounded soldiers and civilians. The pair have no personal stakes in the conflict the images portray, and are consequently able to view the images merely as generic violence, not violence for a cause. Like this pair who "dismiss politics" in order to call all armed conflict an "abomination," proponents of moralizing sonograms too make sweeping, dismissive judgments about the propriety of terminating a pregnancy. Both Sontag''s pair and these anti-abortion activists base their reasoning on similar assumptions about images. While the "grisly photographs" Sontag''s correspondents study "confirm an opinion already held in common" (82), the grainy images of the sonogram confirm pro-life beliefs in those who already possess them. Confirmation is not argument, and contributes nothing useful to a woman''s ability to make an informed evaluation of her unplanned pregnancy.\n\nUsed to construct "versions of reality" that will provide a basis from which to make informed choices, medical imaging shares features with journalistic photography. Looking at visual documentation of suffering, Sontag questions the impartiality of the image, pointing out that "to photograph is to frame, to frame is to exclude" (90). To this phenomenon, the ultrasound introduces a new layer of complexity. As persuasive "evidence," the framing of the sonogram goes beyond the content of the image itself, straight into the context in which the image is viewed. Just as photographs bear "witness to the real, since a person had been there to take them" (Sontag 87), it seems that a crucial step in authenticating the fetal image is the mother''s real-time gaze. Further, as the ultrasound is performed in the medical context, the image is colored with meaning and narrative from the perspective of the ultrasound technician or physician. Beyond these superficial surroundings, the woman considering aborting her fetus is embedded in her own, unique narrative, her own perception of reality.\n\nFor informed consent, consideration of one''s own context is pivotal. Sontag notes that to accept photographs of war as an absolute invective against war itself, one would have to conceive of conflict as "generic" and in so doing, blind oneself to the particulars of a given incident (Sontag 82). Likewise, to focus on the similarity of every fetus to a newborn is to distort the gravity of every woman''s peculiar situation and motivation to obtain an abortion. The unequivocal rendering of the fetus as a fully-fledged member of humankind is complicated by the divisive nature of abortion activism. Martha Nussbaum, in an essay exploring the ethical implications of local as opposed to universal compassion, makes clear the dangers of dismissing details of particular situations or failing to properly imagine the circumstances of others. Even the most admirable ethical agendas can be "not only narrow, failing to include the distant, but also polarizing, dividing the world into an ''us'' and ''them''" (13). The argument against abortion (as constructed around fetal imagery purportedly establishing fetal personhood) makes two such contradictory demands. First, it demands a universal scope in order to defend the contents of every woman''s womb as a member of society. Secondly, it necessitates the adoption of a narrow view that dichotomously categorizes people as either against abortion or for it, as either maternal or murderous. This is analogous to Sontag''s observation that images of war can be used to rally a combatant nation in cases where the audience is "sure that right is on one side, oppression and injustice on the other, and that the fighting must go on" (82). Only with a blurry and unspecified negotiation of the line between axiomatic and contextual thinking can the fetal image be viewed as relevant to the moral decision the woman must make. Suddenly, there is not information, but right and wrong, victims and perpetrators.\n\nThe proponents of ultrasound requirements seem to have anticipated this inconsistency and accounted for it surreptitiously. One must wonder at the use of ultrasound in informed consent when clear, accessible images of fetal development are so ubiquitous. Is there some special magic in seeing, in particular, <em>your</em> fetus as opposed to a generic fetus? If seeing the image is meant to impart some objectively verified, metaphysical truth about the life within, why pull out the ultrasound machine for every pregnancy rather than referring to stock images? If the intention behind displaying the sonogram is to allow women to make an informed choice as to "when life begins," why not distribute biology textbooks? Perhaps the ultrasound sympathizers recognize that generalization of fetal livelihood incurs the problem Nussbaum describes as "watery motivation" in which "the intensity of care" one feels toward her kin "will simply not materialize," being spread too thin (20). For this reason, it becomes necessary to insist upon revealing the contents of the particular woman''s womb. But this is not an act of providing information as to when life begins. This is constructing war between mother and fetus and taking a side, destroying the woman''s inner world, sense of reality, and sense of self as anything besides the enemy of the other.\n\nIs it possible, then, that viewing the sonogram actually deprives the woman of some deliberative faculty? Then again, is it possible to avoid this deprivation? In some sense, the social pressure to behave appropriately with respect to an emotional stimulus undermines our ability to maintain our own sense of reality. Take, for instance, the case Nussbaum presents in which boys raised in cultures of male dominance and projected invulnerability "don''t have the language to describe their own inner worlds and are by the same token clumsy interpreters of the emotions and inner lives of others" (24). Arguably, women surrender the ability to articulate reasoning following from their "inner lives" when confronted with the expectation to sentimentalize the universal fetus. But to think that a socially conditioned response to an image that brings no relevant information to a decision represents an autonomous choice is to nullify the meaning of informed consent altogether. As Sontag asks, "are we better for seeing these images? Do they actually teach us anything? Don''t they rather just confirm what we already know (or want to know)?" (95). Nussbaum might offer a response, observing that "tragic dramas can''t precisely teach anything new since they will be moving only to people who at some level already understand how bad these predicaments are" (26). If anyone understands the predicament, it is the woman faced with the choice of terminating her pregnancy. Thinking otherwise constitutes a gross act of paternalism.\n\nSontag entertains the idea that "the vast maw of modernity has chewed up reality and spat the whole mess out as images" (97). Yet she acknowledges that to make such an assessment is to "assume that everyone is a spectator," a conclusion that removes the stakes, loyalties, and life from any difficult decision (97). According to Sontag, this is a luxury not many can afford, and especially not in the context of informed consent. In his account of what an informed consent process ought to accomplish, philosopher Julian Savulescu emphasizes that "if information is important, so too is a degree of... rationality to draw correct inferences from these facts" (17). This kind of invested reflection is impossible for someone reduced to the role of a mere spectator of images. In order to understand and rationalize what her choice means for her, a woman needs a firm, self-determined grasp on the reality of her situation. This grasp is constructed through words and explanations, not tacit messages transmitted by images. The images do not speak for themselves. Rather, the worldviews of disapproving parties speak through them, impinging upon the very right that informed consent aims to protect.', 'Maternal Integrity and the Fetal Image: Ultrasound in the Abortion Rights Debate', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '207-autosave', '', '', '2012-03-23 15:31:00', '2012-03-23 15:31:00', '', 207, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?p=347', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Sometimes I think us engineers in the School of Engineering and Applied Science deserve it. Once, when a friend casually remarked, “It seems like graduation is light-years away,” I absentmindedly responded, “Light-years measures distance, not time.” She then immediately threw that “SEAS kid” line at me. Another time, when a large group of my Columbia College friends were discussing their Literature Humanities class and were debating about certain philosophers and their beliefs, someone asked me what I thought. I winced, painfully admitting that I did not know a single one of Aristotle’s philosophies. The “SEAS kid” line was hurled again. On late Sunday nights, when a lot of us physics students are working on our long weekly physics problem sets together in our floor lounge, engaging in loud heated debates over topics such as rotational inertia or projectile motion with drag forces, at least a couple of non-engineering students will walk by the door, stick their heads in, and say things like, “You crazy SEAS kids,” or, “Engineers. Ha!” Perhaps engineers really do think, process information, and carry out tasks in a distinctive way. And perhaps these engineer-like tendencies carry over and unravel themselves when we attempt other supposedly nonscientific activities as well, writing being one of them.\n\nBefore writing anything for University Writing, the lens essay, the conversation paper, the research paper, or even this retrospective essay on my own writing, I would become extremely agitated. As soon as I sat down in front of my laptop, I began squirming in my chair as a multitude of uncomfortable questions popped up. There’s a paper due in 12 hours; what do I do? Do I even know anything about this topic? Wait, why am I writing about this subject? Should I change the topic instead? I need a food break! To me, writing a paper is like dismembering a ticking time bomb. I can feel the number of hours and minutes left before the deadline decline in an inverse relation to my exponentially rising frustration.\n\nIn order to ease my anxiety, I consoled myself with the fact that writing can be like science, and thankfully, science is not one of those entirely relative disciplines without concrete answers. Since I always feel like each step in writing any paper is governed by a consistent process, I joyfully discovered that the background procedure to writing a paper can be directly related to and governed by the steps of the scientific method. Yet while this discovery helped steady my pulse and slow my erratic breathing because I am comfortable with the steps of the scientific method, the writing counterparts of these steps were not so painless and were a very trying process this semester, to say the least:\n\n1. <em>Identify the problem or question. </em>This is the brainstorming process for the topic of the essay. It also involves choosing which sources to use to best back up the central argument. This is the easiest and most obvious step of the scientific method with respect to science, since usually someone uses the step process after he or she has recognized that there is a problem to be solved. Because this step in science is self-explanatory, I thought this step in writing would be similar. However, I have learned, in a long brutal way, that if you do not spend sufficient time on this initial step in the writing process, as easy as it may sound, you will pay for it after the first draft is complete. This is exactly what happened to me in the first two essays. I realized that even if someone has a general topic in mind, the first draft may still turn out rather catastrophically if the topic is not planned out well or is not detailed enough.\n\nIn the first essay, in which we were supposed to use a concept from one of the class readings as a “lens” on a subject of my own choosing, I almost disregarded this step. I thought, “Okay, I’m obviously going to write about Vivian Gornick’s essay ‘On the Street: Nobody Watches, Everyone Performs’ and her notion of street theater.” Little did I know that simply defining an author and a vague concept as a topic provides a setup for a rather horrific, confusing first draft. I then faced the mental anguish of writing many more drafts than necessary because I did not spend enough time on this first step. After the first draft was done, I realized that I had many problems in connecting separate experiences into one flowing essay while incorporating Gornick’s ideas and language. Then I separated the experiences into geographic location and wrote the entire essay explaining the differences in location with application to street theater. In the middle, I had problems defining street theater in terms of kinds of performances, and then after I wrote a last sentence about masks, I decided to make the entire essay about two different kinds of masks. I finally changed the topic into masked and unmasked performances in the last draft, feeling extremely queasy from all the unneeded mental exertion. Had I planned out and spent more time identifying and narrowing down the topic in the beginning, I would not have written so much unnecessary and ultimately deleted material, and would not have had to deal with such a messy array of random topics and ideas.\n\nSince I am accustomed to taking the first “identify the problem” step for granted in science, I sadly made the same mistake again with the conversation essay. It had even bigger, messier consequences. I jumped right into the essay without much background planning and ended up writing, once again, many unnecessary pages of drafts. In my first draft, I tried to compare the arguments in Jonathan Lethem’s essay “Speak, Hoyt-Schermerhorn” with Jonathan Franzen’s “Sifting the Ashes,” but afterwards I realized the essay was too loosely connected. I had intended to write about both the personal and documentary-based histories of the two essays, but I did not do enough planning to realize ahead of time that the two essays would be quite impractical to use together. Therefore, I started over completely from scratch, this time using the Lethem essay and Jamaica Kincaid’s “In History.” I quoted too heavily from Kincaid the first time and struggled to incorporate Lethem’s ideas, because, yet again, I did not plan well.\n\nI must say I have learned my lesson, because the punishment of extra writing is really quite harsh for a SEAS kid. Overall, I realized how important this planning process is, not only for the sake of time but also for the quality of the paper. I did not fall into the same trap the third time around in my final research paper, thankfully. This often-overlooked initial step of science is instead crucial to writing.\n\n2. <em>Form a hypothesis.</em> In writing, this includes the entire process of thinking through all the ways of proving the topic that was decided on in step one and putting it down on paper in a first draft. In this step, I noticed a trend in my writing: since engineers tend to be more mechanical, even my attempts to be creative ended up in a structured, process-oriented way. I realized I started each essay the same way with a personal anecdote, always starting with “I”: in my lens essay, “I made my way along the street” (“Mask of Performance” 1), and in the research essay, “I [remembered] riding in a horse carriage” (“Passion for Experimentation” 1). Although I always try to muster up creativity to place into these anecdotes, it is amusing to see how even my creativity is restricted to a formula in my papers.\n\nWithin this second step also lie mechanics and grammar, which are certainly needed as the draft is being created after the brainstorming. Syntax, mechanics, and grammar are all vital aspects of writing but usually are not an engineer’s forte. Like laws and theories in science, I know language and all of its aspects are extremely important in writing; yet in the first couple essays, I consistently brushed over these aspects, and my essay was much lower in quality than it could have been. I actually handed in a final draft of my lens essay that contained mistakes such as writing “an” instead of “and,” due to a lack of proofreading. Since then, I have resolved to spend more time on the technical aspects of writing, and hopefully these careless errors will not appear again.\n\n3.<em> Test your hypothesis with experiments. </em>The writing analogs to these experiments are the many drafts of revision. Within the drafts and revisions, aspects of writing such as structure and organization are important before the final draft. In this step, I noticed another engineer-like aspect of my writing: I like to prove things. I like to follow up statements with supporting material, and I like everything to be backed by evidence. For example, in the research essay, I wrote, “Some proponents of animal rights argue that those supporting animal experimentation have put human rights too high and have complete disregard for the well-being of animals,” but I feel comfortable and justified in dismissing this statement in my essay because there is not “much substantial evidence” to support it (“Passion for Experimentation” 8). I then went on to show how evidence pointed in the opposite way.\n\nWhereas a need to support each statement in an essay is a positive factor that arises from engineer tendencies, a less positive aspect that falls under this third step in writing is a lack of aesthetic tendencies. When drafting, I think of improving the structure of my essays and the format of the argument. I like my essays to be straightforward and to the point, but the aesthetics of writing do not tend to weigh heavily in my mind. I am inclined to make blunt statements such as “Concern and responsibility for human beings has helped push medical innovations to the cutting edge with the help of animal testing” (“Passion for Experimentation” 4). While I used to think this direct approach was not “good,” I realized that there are many approaches to writing, and it is not bad to prefer a straightforward approach to a florid one.\n\n4. <em>Form a conclusion</em>. This is perhaps the sweetest writing step. It marks the completion of the final draft in writing. All the many hours of frustration, stress, and mental anguish have finally converted themselves into words on paper. In science, it denotes a grand conclusion to the guesswork. In both subjects, the last step warrants a ten-decibel yelp of satisfaction and, certainly, relief.\n\nMany humanities courses make engineers shudder, and at the beginning of the semester, for me, writing was one of them. However, looking back, it was not so scary. Sure, the assignments were plentiful, the essays were long, and I lost a lot of sleep in between, but in the end, I really feel transformed into a better writer, even though I am sure that when I finish this last University Writing paper and go dancing around in the hallways announcing the end of my colossal feat, some humanities student will say, “She’s such a SEAS kid.

(349, 8, '2012-02-27 14:42:30', '2012-02-27 14:42:30', '&nbsp;\n\nThe time was 8:45 on a Tuesday morning, the place New York City. As planes crashed and buildings fell, the word “terrorism” took on a new and frightening meaning, and America, which previously had been thought immune to such an attack, was left yearning for the feeling of safety and security that had so quickly been stripped from it. The monster born of that moment—the Terrorist—is one that Americans have fought and feared for five years now.\n\nIt must be understood that the Terrorist exists solely in the minds of Americans; while the threat of terrorism is certainly a reality, our fears and imaginations, fueled by media sensationalism and presidential rhetoric, have transformed the human terrorist (specifically that of militant Islam) into the superhuman “Terrorist”—an entirely irrational and unstoppable being whose only “goal is to…strike America and other free nations with ever-increasing violence” (President Bush, October 6, 2005). This distinction between the real and the imaginary is important, as it is only the latter to which we can apply Monster Theory—a set of seven theses proposed by Jeffrey Cohen which govern the nature and implications of monsters created within a particular cultural context.\n\nCohen’s essay, “Monster Culture (Seven Theses),” makes the claim that at the point at which a culture is forced to reexamine its values (for instance, the willingness to embrace homosexuality) lays a monster (in this case, Francis Ford Coppola’s homoerotic portrait of Dracula). He states that monsters “ask us to reevaluate our cultural assumptions about race, gender, sexuality, our perception of difference, our tolerance toward its expression” (20). However, it seems that “Monster Culture”, specifically when it is applied to the Terrorist, can force us to reevaluate larger issues, even the values most inherent to our culture.\n\nThe first of Cohen’s seven theses states that “the Monster’s body quite literally incorporates fear, desire, anxiety, and fantasy….The monstrous body is pure culture” (4). This seems to be fairly rational; as monsters are created for a particular audience, it is only logical to assume that they are constructed to fit the particularities of that audience. Of course, it must be understood that Cohen is speaking for the monsters of the fictional world, those that we find in literature and film. The Terrorist is unlike any of these monsters in that he is not simply a pop culture phenomenon—he is, in part, a reality. His every detail cannot be altered to fit a particular cultural mentality in the way that Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein or Bram Stoker’s Dracula can. However, though many pieces of the Terrorist’s story are set in factual stone, the Terrorist has been subjected to half a decade of rumor, media hype, and the collective imagination of the American people. Language used when describing the Terrorist has ranged from mild and almost playful (consider the popular “Wanted Dead or Alive: Osama Bin Laden” stickers) to downright slanderous and bigoted (such as talk radio host Michael Graham’s assertion that Islam is essentially “a terrorist organization”), yet has remained universally negative. Such a strong opinion, combined with a lack of cultural knowledge, has caused us to accentuate and even falsely attach certain characteristics to terrorists, breeding this new monster—one that is based partly upon our observations and partly upon our imaginations. The Terrorist, therefore, is no exception to Cohen’s first thesis: though he holds his basis in fact, he is similar to fictional monsters in that he reflects the fears of the culture in which he was created and, as the obvious antagonist, serves as the antithesis to that culture’s values.\n\nCohen goes on to assert that, because monsters are geared toward a particular people, the study of certain monsters can reveal worlds about the cultures to which they belong. “A construct and a projection,” he says, “the monster exists only to be read” (4). A thorough “reading” of the Terrorist—through his descriptions in political speeches, popular media, and private conversations—can therefore provide invaluable insight into America’s current collective mindset. For instance, “freedom-hating” is an epithet commonly ascribed to the Terrorist, as it is generally assumed that we are attacked simply for having those rights that come with a secular democracy. While this is, for the most part, untrue (a majority of terrorists are, ironically, striking back at the institutions which they see as oppressing their own rights to self-determination and freedom), it is nonetheless a part of our construction of the Terrorist, and our value system is clearly reflected in such an image. In much the same way that the homosexual undertones in Bram Stoker’s Dracula exposed the negativity of the public’s heterosexism, the phrase “freedom-hating” paints a favorable picture of America as a country that values free will over authority. Other descriptions are just as telling: the depiction of the Middle Eastern countries in which the Terrorist resides as oppressing women and denying their people certain liberties shows the pride we take in the ideas expressed in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights; media portrayals of Arabs as violent and bloodthirsty (such as those during the recent riots over cartoon drawings of Mohammed) tell of a country that values peace over war and passivity over violence; the simple diction of the labels “extremist” and “fundamentalist” depict an America which values bipartisanship over single-minded leadership and free thought over blindfolded faith.\n\nThis, however, is not new information. We know that freedom and liberty are at the core of America’s values, that senseless violence and religious extremism have long been frowned upon by American society. However, in his final two theses, Cohen reaches two startling conclusions, the first being that our “fear of the monster is really a kind of desire” (16). According to Cohen, the reason we enjoy the experience of monster stories (and by extension, the reason that, despite not having been attacked in five years, we are still glued to our television sets every time the Terrorist is mentioned) is not so much the thrill of fear, but the ability to see our subconscious desires embodied in the monster. “We distrust and loathe the monster at the same time we envy [it]” (17). Therefore, if Monster Culture theory truly applies to the Terrorist, it must be able to shed light on some quality unique to the Terrorist that we, the American people, desire. But what could the Terrorist, the violent, “freedom-hating” being burning holes in our television sets, possibly have that we do not?\n\nThe answer, once again, can be found in the qualities that we have imparted to our monster. When we see the videos in which soon-to-be-terrorists (not individuals in our minds, but manifestations of the larger Terrorist) describe their plans and hopes televised on CNN and cable news, we often wonder at the sheer ignorance of the Terrorist, who believes that he is carrying out the will of God and that he will receive tremendous repayment beyond the grave for murdering himself and others. Yet there is something haunting about that confident stare and those strong words, and one must wonder if ignorance is indeed bliss. The Terrorist, despite his monstrosity, is completely and utterly secure. We secretly envy the Terrorist because, though he is without freedom, he does not need it. He is sure of his place in the world, fully convinced of his own righteousness, and afraid of nothing, not even death. Other societies and peoples have gone to great lengths to achieve such security: many have foregone free thought by joining cults and fundamentalist religions for religious security; entire peoples have supported and fought for fascist governments for physical security; nations have constructed and defended horrendously oppressive institutions (such as slavery in the United States) to provide financial security. After we see the Terrorist speaking with such conviction in his latest video publication, we subconsciously begin to wonder if life would be better if we were to trade a little freedom for security.\n\nIn his last thesis, Cohen simultaneously reaches his conclusion and his climax, stating that “the monster stands at the threshold…of becoming” (20). Because monsters are simply the manifestation of certain desires of the society in which they are created, Cohen states that they generally serve as a prelude to a cultural shift in which the society embraces those qualities embodied in the monster. Monsters can create “a revolution in the very logic of meaning”, he asserts, and the Terrorist has certainly created such a revolution in the minds of Americans (7). Over the past five years, we have allowed many of our democratic rights and values—those same values of free thought, free will, free speech, and peace that seem so alive in our snide references to the “freedom-hating terrorist”—to slowly fade away. The Patriot Act impinges on our freedom from illegal search and seizure, wire-tapping programs are defended as necessary for security, newspaper articles exposing the administration’s torture programs are cut or criticized for posing a “threat to national security,” and we have buried ourselves militarily and financially in a war that is both pointless and endless. One might argue that we are indeed better off; such grievances are, comparatively speaking, minute, and do not affect the average American. Furthermore, these measures seem to have kept terrorism off our shores for the five years they have been in place. However, by continuing down this path we risk everything we value. Cohen states: “the monster stands as a warning against exploration of its uncertain demesnes…to step outside this official geography is to risk…becom[ing] monstrous oneself” (12). That is not to say that the Patriot Act will transform Americans into terrorists, but one could imagine how, given the right course of events, a democratic people would sacrifice more and more of its rights until it fell into a sort of de facto fascism, essentially becoming the monster it hates so much.\n\nOur monster, therefore, is unlike those Cohen describes in that he is a legitimate warning against exploration rather than a scarecrow established in order to maintain the status quo. Past monsters have served as warnings against sexual promiscuity (the temptress demons of <em>Queste del Saint Graal</em>), homosexuality (<em>Dracula</em>), communism (the Hollywood-invading ants of the 1950s horror movie<em>Them!</em>), and even against interfering with established monopolies (the serpents depicted at the edges of trade routes allegedly dreamt up by powerful medieval sea merchants) (13). The Terrorist, however, serves as a warning against sacrificed freedom. To heed this warning would not be to limit ourselves as in the examples above, but to preserve our way of life. In the case of the Terrorist, the status quo is favorable, and exploration of the monster’s world, where freedom is viewed as a threat, should be avoided at all costs.\n\nFive years ago, as we emerged from the chaos of 9/11 trying to make sense of this new and frightening world in which even the US is vulnerable, we looked into the eyes of the monster and for an instant saw something desirable, something we desperately needed, and, to a certain degree, we’ve obtained it. Where we go from here depends upon the terrorists’ actions and upon how rationally we are able to approach our fears. The one thing we can be sure of, however, is that, as Cohen states, “the monster always escapes,” and the Terrorist, alongside the threat of our own impulses, will always haunt us (4).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBush, George W.

I set the pile down by a computer and check some subject lines again to make sure I don’t miss anything. Sure enough, many more promising titles pop up. I write them down. Cut. The pile has doubled in size. I begin the process of whittling them down, opening each and glancing through to see if it’s actually relevant. Cut. Three books have been discarded. I pick up the pile and take it to the circulation desk. There’s a woman in front of me trying to find something on reserve. She’s taking a really long time. My arms are going to fall off. It turns out the book she needs is in another library, and she leaves. The girl behind the desk apologizes. I drop the books on the counter. When she’s done checking them out, I spend several minutes trying to stuff them all into my bag. The last one goes in, though the bag won’t close. I exit the main doors.\r\n\r\nTalking head shot: Me. That was the third paper I had to do for this class. I’d hoped\r\nwriting it would be a perfected process that I had arrived at through writing the first two. But it definitely wasn’t. It was actually more like going over the edge of a cliff. All the bad habits and the guilty pleasures that made the first two papers difficult manifested themselves more than ever in this third and greatest paper. There was just so much potential for taking the topic anywhere I wanted. I guess I took it everywhere I wanted.\r\n\r\n<em>New scene: small classroom at El Dorado Community College.

Sometimes it was for guest speakers like Japanese internment camp survivor Mas Hatano, or feminist historian Sally Roesch Wagner; sometimes it was simply for her lectures, when they were particularly interesting. I reveled in taking notes on the various discourses, and prided myself on remembering what I’d learned. I was particularly happy when I knew something that the rest of the class didn’t, like that the “Three Sisters” of the Iroquois was the tribe’s term for their sacred trio of staple crops—corn, beans, and squash.</em>\r\n\r\nThe girl has filled up a page with notes, and turns it over. Cut to the Central Library in Sacramento. The same girl, perhaps a year older, has covered a table on the third floor with books on coral reefs. She sits in the chair and pours over a particularly large and colorful book. Others open to reveal pictures and descriptions of clown fish, anemones, the bleaching phenomenon, and small sharks. Her notebook, upgraded now to a red Five-Star, is open to a page half-filled with notes. Narration continues: While other children avoided homework, preferring to play outside or, when we reached the fourth grade, to listen to the Spice Girls and read Nickelodeon magazine, I expanded my homework time, even creating assignments of my own. I loved researching and writing up reports, whether it was on marine biology or paleontology or the Big Bang. I would create PowerPoint presentations to showcase what I had learned and share it with my family. Not that my papers and presentations were amazing pieces of polished research; in fact, they were quite\r\nsimplistic and generally included as many colorful pictures as possible. But the fact was that I truly loved learning. I loved, and still love, being able to explore the reaches of modern knowledge and expand my own horizons through research and reading.\r\n\r\n<em>Scene shift: a four-year-old girl, clearly the younger version of the earlier girl,\r\nstands near a sunny preschool playground with two other girls.\r\nGirl 1: What would you wish for if you found a genie?\r\nGirl 2: I’d wish I was a princess.

High school meant hours of assigned homework every day, as\r\nwell as hours of “to-do”s that were not homework, such as practicing for orchestra,\r\npreparing for Mock Trial, or dealing with college applications. As time allowed only for learning what was being taught in class, the luxury of intellectual exploration disappeared. Even when writing papers, we focused not on preparing a body of research but on being able to write a reasonably coherent piece in a restricted period of time.\r\n\r\n<em>New Scene: 412 Pupin.

I start to write.</em>\r\n\r\nTalking head shot: Me. What was going through my head when we did that first free write? Something along the lines of, “Wow! Here I had expected this class to just be tedious work, but it’s actually like creative writing! This is so cool! I’m actually going to enjoy this!” When the real assignments started, the research-loving child within me was awakened. I think I had forgotten just how much there was to learn that wasn’t taught in the classroom. Unfortunately, I was a little out of control. So many doors had been opened that I couldn’t resist trying to walk through all of them—whether that meant trying to fit in an analysis of every president’s use of public and hidden transcripts since Teddy Roosevelt in a paper on the 2004 Kerry-Bush election or wanting to discuss all the details of women’s roles in and attitudes toward society from World War II through the modern feminist movement, not to mention an analysis of the dichotomy of the treasured and admired and the reviled and feared in Othello, in a paper on the vilification of women in the 1950s; or [laughs] attempting to fit an analysis of all of modern alternative medicine techniques, a dissection of the medical-industrial complex, a discussion of the spiritual basis for the effectiveness of meditation, a chronicle of the evolution of spiritual healing practices, and an evaluation of plausible links between transcendent abilities and quantum physics, into a single research paper. Yeah, I know.\r\n\r\n<em>Scene shift: still 412 Pupin. The same students look decidedly more worn; they now\r\nsport winter coats and boots. The professor explains that they are to discuss their\r\nindividual writing processes with their partner —what works, what doesn’t work,\r\nwhat the constant trends are. Cut to close-up, Sara and me.\r\nSara: And I pretty much always write my papers the night before they’re due. It’s\r\nlike I can’t possibly start before that. I’m not really sure why. I mean, some people\r\ndo that and they’re okay with it because it works for them. But it just makes me so\r\nstressed out, you know?</em>\r\n\r\nMe: I guess mine’s pretty similar. I definitely can’t write anything prior to the night\r\nbefore either. I think part of it might be perfectionism, you know, like if I wait until the last minute then it’ll be okay if I don’t do really well because, hey, I did it at the last minute. But if I start early, then I have to do well because I have plenty of time. I think another part of it is just my indecision. When we have these broad topics, and especially since we can choose whatever we’re interested in, I always find myself choosing something I’m very interested in, which makes it nearly impossible to choose just which tiny aspect of that I’ll turn into a paper, until the night-before  pressure kicks in. As for my writing process once I start the paper … I guess it’s pretty similar to what it was before we started having to do all those timed essays in high school. Yeah, it’s just like what you said, “I don’t write drafts; I write papers.” Somehow, when I know the work I’m doing is supposed to turn into a nice, organized paper, I just can’t write exploratorily. Whether I have a written outline or just one in my head, the things I write next have to come in a logical sequence or it doesn’t even occur to me to write them. By the time I’m two-thirds through, the little editor in me is preparing to link everything back to the beginning, tie up loose ends, and conclude.\r\n\r\n<em> New scene: Milstein reading room, Butler Library.

In the midst of a Butler all-nighter, I finally achieved the ability to cast aside what wasn’t needed and narrow my focus. Perhaps it was just because I was tired and couldn’t care anymore about all the extra things that had seemed so interesting, or perhaps I had truly mastered a skill; either way, it worked.\r\n<em>\r\nNew scene: I’m hiking in the mountains above Lake Tahoe, California.

I could learn about anything, write about anything, and analyze in\r\nways that high school had never allowed. The vast library stacks from 114th to 171st\r\nwere mine for the conquering. But over the course of the semester, I had to learn\r\nsomething that had never been a problem when I was a little girl making PowerPoint presentations. I had to learn to prioritize—to pick an argument and write what was applicable—nothing more, nothing less. I found that while my well-sourced dissertations on everything under the sun might be interesting to me, the only way to write a good paper—one that is effective and worth reading—is to be focused.

(416, 8, '2012-02-27 14:37:43', '2012-02-27 14:37:43', 'I stand at the corner of Broadway and 128th Street. Overhead, the elevated No. 1 train rumbles by. Once this has passed, a ratcheting from the auto body shop to my left picks up the chorus. Then, the high-pitched beeping of a truck in reverse chimes in. The layers of noise are rich with urban industry and have more presence than actual people. I head west on 128th Street toward the Hudson River and into the neighborhood that is the site of Columbia University’s proposed Manhattanville campus. I don’t see any trees along the street. The gray sidewalk makes a 90-degree angle with a warehouse building. The brick and concrete walls of this neighborhood are home to 400 residents and roughly 1,600 jobs. Columbia University is proposing to develop a secondary campus on the 17-acre plot of land in West Harlem. It is a 30-year expansion plan to “allow an elite but cramped university to build additional academic and residential buildings, including new facilities for its arts and business schools and dozens of modern science research labs it needs to keep pace with other Ivy League universities” (Williams). In addition to providing academic resources, the project is intended to weave the “university into the fabric of city life” (Columbia University Web site).\r\n\r\nTo develop the campus, most of the structures and people in the neighborhood will be displaced. Behind these walls is a community that has been sensitive to the threat of displacement since the ’60s, when the university was “purchasing apartment buildings all over Morningside Heights, displacing thousands of poor, mostly black and Puerto Rican residents” (Eviatar). This West Harlem neighborhood is the frontier of a gentrification movement sweeping through New York City and other American urban centers.\r\n\r\nIn his essay “Frontiers in American History and the Role of the Frontier Historian,” Jack D. Forbes defines the concept of a frontier as “a meeting point where two forces come up against each other, whether they be groups of human beings or such vague things as civilization and wilderness or knowledge and potential knowledge … [and therefore] there can be no frontier without … a contact situation” (206). The Manhattanville project has created a meeting point where the Columbia community comes into contact with the West Harlem community. At this frontier there are two fundamental points of tension: one is a local concern and involves debates about the development process of the new campus; the other is relevant to developing urban areas all over America and involves gentrification and the displacement of low-income residents. By viewing expansion in America through a historical lens, this paper examines the Manhattanville project and the contemporary threat of gentrification. It illuminates the perspectives of the Columbia and West Harlem communities at the Manhattanville frontier in an effort to understand the dynamics of the relationship at this “meeting point.”\r\n\r\nThe proposed Manhattanville campus is a result of Columbia’s efforts to remain a competitive Ivy League institution. In a 2006 New York Times article, Columbia President Lee Bollinger commented, “As knowledge grows and fields grow, we need more faculty, you need a certain scale.” He added, “Columbia has 194 square feet per student; Harvard boasts 368” (Eviatar). The Columbia community has argued that the new facilities will function as a place of intellectual and scientific development of benefit to society as a whole. In a 2007 New York Times article, Columbia spokeswomen La-Verna Fountain built on Bollinger’s comments, stating, “Columbia wants to work on the kinds of issues that impact humanity, like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease” (Lee). Columbia’s impetus for the Manhattanville campus stems from market pressures, but the project has the potential to generate contributions beyond self-interested financial gains. According to the Columbia community, the campus expansion can and should contribute to the development of a healthy society. The developmental logic of Columbia holds that expansion of its domain is related to societal advancement.\r\nIn an 1893 address before the American Historical Association in Chicago, Frederick Jackson Turner discussed the ideological relationship between expansion and a successful society. He provided an Anglo-American description of America’s western frontier during the 1890s and the societal implications of Manifest Destiny:\r\n\r\nThe peculiarity of the American institution is the fact that they have been compelled to adapt themselves to the changes of an expanding people—to the changes involved in crossing a continent, in winning a wilderness, and in developing at each area of this progress out of the primitive economic and political conditions of the frontier into the complexity of city life. (2)\r\n\r\nTurner applauded America for “continually advancing [its] frontier line … this fluidity of American life, this expansion westward with its new opportunities, its continuous touch with the simplicity of primitive society, furnish the forces dominating American character” (2). This perspective can help us understand the debate about the Manhattanville project by contextualizing the situation within the historical approach of the “American character” to growth. The Columbia administration’s motivations do not mimic Turner’s statement in regard to how the native community of West Harlem is viewed, nor does the Columbia community view West Harlem as a “wilderness” with “primitive economic and political conditions.” Columbia administrators argue, however, that the development of Manhattanville will advance societal progress as a whole. Turner argued that the expansion of the Western frontier helped solidify America’s national character and some areas of governmental policy: “It is safe to say that the legislation with regard to land, tariff, and internal improvements … was conditioned on frontier ideas and needs” (27).\r\n\r\nColumbia champions an ideology similar to Turner’s, in that expansion would allow the university to make medical advancements of benefit to society. Bollinger comments, “We [Columbia] need to have the property in order to build a campus … that’s able to do the kind of intellectual work that needs to be done …” He continues, “We cure disease and find cures, and we try to understand the world, and we educate people, and we are basically a public service institution” (Columbia Spectator). The relationship that Turner suggests—between expansion and societal development—is also prevalent in Columbia’s perspective. This is a relationship that has been the driving force of American urban growth since the settling of the Western frontier, as discussed by Turner, more than a century ago.\r\n\r\nForbes argues that the Turner approach to the frontier neglects the populations that already live in the area of desired expansion. He criticizes Turner’s account of the western frontier: “while undoubtedly serving a useful purpose within the frame work of Anglo-American nationalism, [Turner’s ideas are] essentially one-sided and ethnocentric. It is in effect looking at an inter-group contact situation entirely from the point of view of one of the interested participants” (204-205). As we saw earlier, Forbes points out that any frontier frames two groups “in a contact situation.” Turner’s “one-sided” approach undermines this idea and overlooks the social dynamics present at a frontier. This criticism is not entirely applicable to Columbia’s approach to the Manhattanville project, as the university is well aware of the West Harlem community. However, the development of Manhattanville has been initiated by, designed for, and is largely beneficial to only one party, the Columbia community.\r\n\r\nThe West Harlem community’s inequality in the development project is exemplified by Columbia’s attempt to acquire the land. The university already owns over 50 percent of the 17-acre property, but needs to purchase the remaining buildings before it can develop the campus. There is a group of West Harlem property owners who refuse to sell to the university. The group is concerned that they will lose clientele if they have to relocate their businesses. Columbia has made clear that, if necessary, it will use eminent domain laws to acquire the rest of the land. Eminent domain allows the state to transfer property from one private owner to another. The residents of West Harlem question why the university insists on occupying all of the land in the proposed area. In a 2007 New York Times article, local resident Luisa Henriquez complained, “They want us out of here, they want it all. Columbia should work around us; they say everything is for the students. What about us?” (Lee).\r\n\r\nColumbia President Bollinger counters that “if needed to fulfill our public service responsibility and if the state were willing to use eminent domain … it would be irresponsible to take it off the table” (Columbia Spectator). This standpoint raises Forbes’s concern that the traditional Turner-American approach to expansion can cause a one-sided expression of growth. West Harlem residents have opinions concerning eminent domain, but the complexity of the situation and Columbia’s dominant role serve to silence their voices.\r\n\r\nThe deeper source of tension at the Manhattanville frontier exceeds local concerns about the physical development of the campus. The Manhattanville project is symbolic of the gentrification process underway throughout Harlem. A 2002 Columbia Spectator article outlines the university’s role in this process:\r\n\r\nThe recent influx of higher-income individuals [to the Harlem area] has given many landlords a reason to overturn rental regulations in favor or wealthier tenants, thus disadvantaging long-time low-income residents … Students represent a large portion of these new, higher-paying tenants … and Columbia’s proximity makes this even more of a threat in Harlem than in other gentrified neighborhoods. (Johnson)\r\n\r\nAn influx of upper-middle-class students and staff threatens to displace lower-income local residents. The development of Manhattanville could become a new phase in an ongoing process that is destructive to the Harlem community’s heritage. Local residents are aware that the new campus will drive up surrounding real estate values and jeopardize their ability to live in the area. At an August 2007 public hearing, Nellie Bailey of the Harlem Tenants Council argued:\r\n\r\nColumbia University’s expansion cannot be viewed in isolation from the overall gentrification of Harlem … The masses of Blacks, especially the poor and working classes are exacerbated, angry, demoralized and put off … there is no political will from elected officials to provide a viable alternative to the powers-that-be including Columbia University’s land grab that will permanently alter the ethnic, socio-economic and political demographics of West Harlem, and by extension the greater community of Harlem. (NBPC website)\r\n\r\nBailey articulates the local community’s fear of being driven out of their own neighborhood and their resultant distrust of Columbia University. Still, the university argues that the proposed campus is designed to bolster neighborhood quality of life: “Columbia has promised to relocate residents directly displaced by its $7 billion plan, which it expects will create nearly 7,000 new jobs over 25 to 30 years … It has reserved space on the campus for a public school specializing in math, science and engineering” (Eviatar). Columbia plans to take financial responsibility for the dislocation of residents and, in turn, to focus on the potential for creating economic and educational opportunities in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nThe project offers other benefits, as evidenced by Columbia’s architectural design philosophy that “an urban campus isn’t defined by gates and walls, but by weaving the university into the fabric of city life.” (Columbia University Web site). The university boasts that “new trees, lighting, street furnishings, public art and publicly accessible open space would invite people to the entire area. New buildings would not only be open to the public but would also look and feel open because of transparent glass at the street level” (Columbia University Web site). This is an intelligent, modern approach to the urban placement of an academic institution. The goal of chief architect Renzo Piano, a native of Italy, is to create the feel of a piazza. He states, “the people will come, there will be discourse” (Eviatar). Piano and the university aim to create a space where the Ivy League and West Harlem communities can share their day-to-day activities and thereby engage in a dialogue that will further human understanding. This type of engagement is a fundamental device of intellectual inquiry and, if realized, could benefit both groups at the frontier.\r\n\r\nFor discourse to occur, however, there needs to be an element of trust between the West Harlem and Columbia communities. In her essay “The Uses of Sidewalks: Contact,” Jane Jacobs examines the elements necessary for constructive public contact. She states, “The sum of such casual public contact at a local level … is a feeling for the pubic identity of people, a web of public respect and trust, and a resource of personal or neighborhood need. The absence of this trust is a disaster to a city street. Its cultivation cannot be institutionalized. And, above all, it implies no private commitments” (73-74). The problem with Manhattanville’s attempt to create a public space where West Harlem and Columbia will have “contact at a local level” is that the very existence of the campus creates distrust between the two groups. Chairperson of the local community board Jordi Reyes-Montblanc commented, “On a scale of 1 to 10, Columbia is a minus 5 in terms of trust” (Williams). Due to the university’s fraught history with Harlem, concerns about eminent domain, and the threat of gentrification, the West Harlem community is hard-pressed to feel “pubic respect and trust” toward Columbia. Distrust—or, worse, resentment—could lead the Harlem community to avoid the new campus, which would obviously make physical and intellectual exchange with the Columbia community unlikely.\r\nIt is important to include the perspective of the students who would occupy the future Manhattanville campus, as they would be responsible for half of the intercultural discourse that might occur at this frontier. As a Columbia student, I am aware of my contribution to the gentrification of the Morningside Heights neighborhood and feel some discomfort in being party to a process that has driven out local residents. I do realize that gentrification has helped to make the neighborhood safer for the residents who live here, and I appreciate my opportunities as a Columbia student. Given what I understand of the Manhattanville frontier, however, I am unsure of my ability to engage in a dialogue with the West Harlem community. If the local community is uncomfortable with my presence in West Harlem due to eminent domain disputes or the larger threat of gentrification that I represent, then I too would be uncomfortable on the campus. If my presence is a source of tension for the local community, I would be nervous to enter the campus. And yet I agree with Columbia’s argument that the expansion can be seen as an opportunity to weave “the university into the fabric of city life.”\r\nBy viewing the dynamics of the Manhattanville-West Harlem relationship as a frontier, one can better understand the perspective of both parties affected by this meeting point. The university’s expansion is part of the larger history of unequal growth and development that spans from the American West’s “civilization” to contemporary gentrification frontiers. The conflicting needs and concerns of the Columbia and West Harlem communities make for a challenging relationship. But by making an effort to preserve the local community, Columbia University has an opportunity to rethink how American institutions approach growth. The Manhattanville project could become a model for expansion that is sensitive to the economic, social, and cultural complexities present at the urban frontier. ', 'Manhattanville, Meet West Harlem: An Urban Frontier', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '242-autosave', '', '', '2012-02-27 14:37:43', '2012-02-27 14:37:43', '', 242, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?p=416', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
(418, 8, '2012-02-27 14:45:42', '2012-02-27 14:45:42', 'For a twenty-three year old, Erika has had a life comparable to that of an eighty year old—she has danced to Ecuadorian flutes in fiestas, gone sailing in Singapore, and spent vacations visiting the Malaysian rain forest and Karen tribes in New Zealand. Yet for all the cultural knowledge Erika has gained by growing up in countries far away from her native New York, she lacks something few go through life without: a feeling of home. Erika was one of the young adults interviewed by David Pollock, a social anthropologist who studies third-culture kids, children who “have spent . . . at least part of their childhood in countries and cultures other than their own” (6). Erika has no single nationality but rather a “third nationalism”—she feels no real attachment to her birth nation, the United States, but has no legal ties to the country that captured her heart, Singapore. National attachment is the focus of Benedict Anderson’s book,<em> Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism</em>, in which he states that “nationalism, [a] cultural artifa[ct]”(4), arises from citizens'' common history and shared cultural markers, such as language, appearance, and ethnicity. For Erika, however, these represent the mechanisms that prevented her from establishing a connection with any country, leaving her displaced and nation-less.\r\n\r\nWhereas language can foster feelings of connection among citizens of a nation, in the case of third-culture kids such as Erika, language often prevents nationalist feelings from arising. Erika explains how language alienated her from her birth country, relating “how strange she had felt the first time her American cousins had asked her to go ‘cruising’ ” during her vacation-stay in her native New York. “She presumed they [had] meant some type of boat ride. . . . to her amazement, cruising . . . meant endless driving about town with no apparent purpose” (Pollock 11-12). Her inability to understand what her cousins had meant by “cruising” caused Erika to feel distance from her home country. As a result, Erika disassociated the United States, stating that “for her, ‘going home’ meant returning to Singapore at the end of summer” (Pollock 12). Erika thereby challenges Anderson’s argument that language is responsible for creating “horizontal comradeship,” (7) and that “the nation was conceived in language, not in blood” (145). In fact, it is language that distanced Erika from the citizens of her “imagined political community,” (6) breaking the connections she had to the country rather than forging them.\r\n\r\nJust as language can serve to exclude, so can appearance. After living most of her teenage years in Singapore, Erika had come to think of this country as her home, introducing herself to peers at her American university as being from there. Yet she was distressed when they replied, “ ‘Really? You don’t look like it’ ” (Pollock 12). She didn’t fit in with her American counterparts either, due to her foreign fashions, expressions, and gestures. It was not until she adjusted by taking on more American clothes and tastes that “others accepted her as one of them” (Pollock 12). Thus it seems that outward appearance is important in the determination of one’s nationality. However, even after Erika changed her clothing style enough for her peers to invite her into their community, she did not fully fit in. Erika continued to feel that Americans “couldn’t understand her world . . . [and that] she couldn’t understand theirs” (Pollock 13). While being outwardly recognized as American due to her Caucasian features and clothing, on the inside Erika didn’t feel American at all.\r\n\r\nMore telling than clothing, gestures, or accents, are skin color and racial features. While Erika associated herself with Singapore, upon a trip back to the country after college, Erika found out that she did not belong there either. Erika was distressed to find that as a young white woman she stood out from other Singaporeans. She came to the realization that “here, in the world she had always thought of as home . . . she was seen as a foreigner” (Pollock 16). Anderson posits that one''s ethnicity plays a big role in the formation of ties to fellow citizens. He gives the example of Javanese villagers, who “have always known that they are connected to people they have never seen,” aware that they have “indefinitely stretchable nets of kinship and clientship” (6). In other words, the fact that we will never get to see everyone in our community, and much less our country, does not prevent us from feeling connected to our fellow citizens based on our cultural and ethnic similarities. Erika’s foreign ethnicity, however, prevented these national ties from being fully formed.\r\n\r\nThus the country Erika legally belongs to does not feel like home and inspires no nationalist feelings, yet she has no ties with the country she chose to be hers—and even she had, she would still stand out from the population due to her skin color. No matter where Erika settles, she will always be a foreigner, preventing feelings of “horizontal comradeship” from arising and preventing her from developing any sense of nationalism. Anderson, however, argues that nationalist feelings form because of the immediate attachment between those who share a culture, language, or ethnic markers. He sees these feelings as inherent and natural, and argues that “in everything ‘natural’ there is something unchosen” (143). He compares the “disinterred [feelings of] love and solidarity” we have for our families to the feelings we have for our nations since we can’t choose either (144). Anderson even asserts that “everyone can, should, [and] will ‘have’ a nationality” (5). While this may be true for those who have remained in one nation for most if not all of their lives, Erika’s experience growing up in several nations troubles the concept of a “naturalized nationality.”\r\n\r\nErika’s lack of a definite nationalism shows that one is not born with roots to a country but rather with an ability to develop nationalist feelings. Erika’s attachment to Singapore is a demonstration of this, but it also reveals the pains and challenges that result from developing ties to a country other than one’s own. Indeed, if nationalism has “proved notoriously difficult to define” (Anderson 3), then Erika’s “third nationalism”—in which no relation is established with one’s birth country, and all relations to other countries are uncredentialed—is perhaps impossible to define. The belief held by Tom Nairn that “Nationalism . . . [is] as inescapable as neurosis” (qtd. in Anderson 5), may be correct after all; it might just be that Erika has no country to put her nationalism in and has to awkwardly carry it around without ever finding a place to place it. Confronted with no nation to call her own, Erika is left to ponder, “Where [is] home now?” (Pollock 12). Perhaps what she should ask is, “Will I ever have a sense of home?”\r\n\r\nThe experience of third culture kids is a difficult one, especially due to the lack of connection that these children feel for their home country, to which many return. In addition to the difficulty of forming bonds to countries to which one does not legally belong, they face living with a second-rate status compared to real citizens, and constantly worrying about when the next move will be. Benedict Anderson’s “natural nationalism” is hard to apply to such children, whose homes change so often that they are ultimately left with none. Yet while nationalism is not a naturalized feeling, it can, as Anderson states, be considered a creation of our environment that requires constant upkeep and reassurance from the threats that are imposed by such anomalies as third culture kids.', 'Nation-less: The Unnaturalness of Nationalism as Shown by Third-Culture Kids', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '237-autosave', '', '', '2012-02-27 14:45:42', '2012-02-27 14:45:42', '', 237, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?p=418', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

(420, 8, '2012-02-27 14:47:54', '2012-02-27 14:47:54', 'There is a section of the Talmud devoted to the complicated subject of life after death. This section contains imaginative debates on the existence of the afterlife, its location, its contents, and, most importantly, who it is open to. In one discussion, the Talmud speculates that the hereafter is a giant classroom filled with the great Rabbis of yore discussing the fine points of Jewish law for all eternity. For anyone who spent his life devoted to Jewish law and study, this classroom is heaven. For everyone else, it is hell.\r\n\r\nSeveral months ago I found myself thinking about this explanation as I sat in a similar classroom, albeit one located in my Yeshiva in Israel. At the front of the classroom a teacher was expounding on <em>Halacha</em>: the highly logic-based Jewish legal system derived from the Talmud and meant to serve as a guide to the rituals and laws of Judaism and more generally as an all-encompassing guide to life. The topic of the day was the laws of the Sabbath and my teacher''s analysis was as thorough as usual. "If a pot of soup is placed on a fire before the Sabbath," he explained, "one may take if off the fire during the Sabbath. However, if one places it back on the fire, he has violated the Sabbath." He continued, "If one adds water to it, he has violated the Sabbath. If one stirs it, he has violated the Sabbath." He paused, as if expecting the class to leap with surprise, and then continued, "The Talmud brings a case where a person stirred the soup after the pot was taken off the flame. Rabbi Akiva says this person has violated the Sabbath while Rabbi Eliezer says he has not."\r\n\r\nWhat I can''t begin to explain is how utterly boring such <em>Halacha</em> discussions are. Talmud study is one thing; the fine-tuned dialectical legal analysis and the close text study can be strangely fascinating. Pure <em>Halacha</em> lessons, on the other hand, generally consist of one long laundry list of dos and don''ts, and unlike Talmud study, which is often done as a purely intellectual exercise, <em>Halacha</em> lessons are supposed to have some "practical" real-world application.\r\n\r\nOn that day, however, the practicality was lost to me and I couldn''t help but muse to myself, with a slight dose of Jewish irony, "so this is heaven?" But then it hit me: was this detail-obsessed, legalistic learning in fact supposed to be heavenly? What was this law, this <em>Halacha</em> that I was meant to study as if it held the key to all existence? Was there any Truth in it; was there even any common sense?\r\n\r\nThe familiar cycle of negotiating compromises between past convictions and present priorities is the subject of Gerald Early''s essay "Their Malcolm, My Problem." Early, a professor of African-American Studies, sees two paths that the contemporary black community has taken. On the one hand, Early sees that his young students have embraced radical Black Power and Afrocentric politics. On the other hand, he sees that his daughters, having grown up in a white suburban neighborhood, seem disconnected from their black identity. Early''s own relationship with his past attraction to the Black Power Movement, especially to the ideas found in The Autobiography of Malcolm X, come into play as he is forced to negotiate between his past belief in Afrocentrism and his present "white" suburban lifestyle. In one particularly telling scene in the essay, Early rants to one of his daughters about the dangerous messages found in the Autobiography of Malcolm X.\r\n<blockquote> "Never have I been subjected to more anti-intellectual, proto-fascistic nonsense than what I have had to endure in the name of Afrocentrism. And this man," I said, waving Malcolm''s autobiography, "is the architect of it all, the father of Afrocentrism. This idiot, this fool." I slumped at the kitchen table, placing my forehead against the cool wood. "But I thought you liked Malcolm X," she said (90).</blockquote>\r\nEarly does indeed "like" Malcolm X; he is nostalgic for the days when Malcolm''s message moved him to be proud of his black heritage. Early finds himself in an almost paradoxical situation: he recognizes that the civil rights movement has allowed him to achieve the suburban "white" lifestyle that was once closed to black Americans. He recognizes that Malcolm X may have been misguided in his demands that blacks separate themselves from American society and that integration has, in fact, been possible. But although The Autobiography of Malcolm X now seems to Early "as narrow as it was vivid" (87), he is also nostalgic for the days when it moved him to be proud of his black heritage and to fight the white establishment. He fondly remembers a story about when he and his friend Gary stood up to a group of racist thugs and regrets that the story means nothing to his daughters. Indeed, he feels that his daughters have "no sense of blackness" (96). Early finds himself in limbo between the Black Power politics of Malcolm X that he rejected, and the Civil Rights Movement integration that has given him the success and affluence he now has. This doubt over the path his life has taken plagues Early and forces him to try to reconcile his desire for a sense of black "specialness" (95) with the knowledge that his children are receiving privileges they never could have in the age of Malcolm X.\r\n\r\nIt is this feeling of limbo, this sense of doubt over the path life can take, that I experienced that day in <em>Halacha</em> class. The belief I once had in the importance of<em>Halacha</em> was simply no longer there. I found myself wondering what, if anything, had ever made me believe in <em>Halacha</em>: what had allowed me to treat this elaborate system of rules and regulations as an all- encompassing guide to life?\r\n\r\nIn elementary school, whenever I or a classmate would ask a teacher "why this detail?" or "why that ritual" the pat response would always be "because this is what God expects of you." When probing further, a teacher might mumble something about getting "a reward from God," although this was always said with a tone of reluctance. As I grew older, these questions were replaced with a sense that<em>Halacha</em> was simply as much a part of my life as school, friends and family. I simply didn''t have the time or the patience to grapple with such metaphysical questions and I gradually fell into a cycle of complacency.\r\n\r\nMy unthinking acceptance of <em>Halacha</em>, however, was challenged during the first few weeks of high school. At the end of the school day, a group of us would often start walking towards the nearby bus stop. Immediately after the school was out of sight, my friends would remove their yarmulkes, the caps which are supposed to be worn by Orthodox males at every moment. Inside the school building the teachers forced us to wear our yarmulkes, but outside no-one was stopping us from taking them off and enjoying a bus ride home without the uncomfortable knowledge that everyone on the bus knew we were Orthodox Jews. I too contemplated taking off mine, but something always held me back. When trying to identify this unseen force, this feeling of unease at the idea of publicly violating Jewish law, I found my way back to that murmured word from elementary school: "reward." Surely if God expected me to wear my yarmulke constantly, as my teachers claimed, He would reward me for it. This explanation became my guiding light during high school.<em>Halacha</em> became a system where the more details I followed, the more reward points God would give me. Who knew when or where this reward would be given? The simple understanding that each element of <em>Halacha</em> had some meaningful ramification was enough for me.\r\n\r\nAt Yeshiva, I found myself surrounded by Judaism and <em>Halacha</em> and soon this explanation began to lose its appeal. I looked around at the many Rabbis and students who devoted so much time to the study and practice of <em>Halacha</em> and began wondering what their motivation was. Was it one giant game of reward-and-punishment for them as well? I often found myself thinking about that strange section of the Talmud concerning the afterlife. The anecdote about the giant classroom is intended to demonstrate that finding fulfillment through religious study and <em>Halacha</em> should be akin to heaven: one should not grudgingly practice Judaism in anticipation of some other reward in the afterlife, because what awaits is simply more of the same. But I could not understand how <em>Halacha</em> could be valuable in and of itself, without the promise of a reward. I continued to practice and study<em>Halacha</em>, but my actions began to feel petty and meaningless. Still, it was difficult to give up practices and rituals that had so long been a part of my life, even while the hypocrisy of adhering to <em>Halacha</em> without knowing why weighed hard on me.\r\n\r\nTowards the middle of my year at Yeshiva, several teachers announced the creation of a new class, the title of which translates roughly to "Applied <em>Halacha</em>." Intrigued, I attended the first lecture with Rabbi Elisha, a <em>Halacha</em> expert and theologian. Rabbi Elisha''s interpretation of <em>Halacha</em> shocked and intrigued me: he claimed that <em>Halacha</em> is not a set of rules meant to be mindlessly followed out of some existential deference to God. Rather, it can be seen as a complex, changing social system. He stressed that the moral rules of Judaism should always take precedence over ritual, but every ritual also has some basic human value at its core. The intricate and complicated details of <em>Halacha</em> are necessary, Rabbi Elisha maintained, since the more a person remains hyperconscious of the details of a ritual, the more the value of ritual shines through.\r\n\r\nRabbi Elisha''s lectures also tackled the Laws of the Sabbath. For him, the Sabbath and its many intricate rules were about demarcating a special day of rest from the banal, work-filled days of the week. The many laws of stirring soup on the Sabbath were designed to permeate every detail of life with this separation, forcing a person to remain conscious at every moment of the special nature of the Sabbath.\r\n\r\nRabbi Elisha''s philosophy helped me realize that I did not need to abandon<em>Halacha</em>; I needed to reinterpret it by framing my understanding around its human and social values. With Rabbi Elisha''s help, I began reexamining <em>Halacha</em>, searching for the human value behind it. I felt as if I had graduated from the simplistic theological lens of reward-and-punishment towards a new and higher Truth.\r\n\r\nBut such things rarely end up as simple as they sound at first. Early looks back on his past Afrocentrism with a romantic sense of nostalgia. From a practical point of view, his suburban "white" lifestyle offers him everything the Civil Rights Movement fought for: dignity, freedom, equality. Yet Early on some level regrets the loss of black separateness that came with the end of segregation. He understands the appeal of Malcolm X''s Afrocentrism for his young students: it provides that sense of "specialness" that separateness can bring. As Early sees his daughters adopting "white" values he remembers the appeal of the simple worldview of the Afrocentric movement, even though it is anathema to everything he has become. When I left Yeshiva, I too began to feel a tension between the honesty of my new worldview and the simplicity of my old one. I found it difficult to remain committed to the entire system of <em>Halacha</em> when my rationale was the "human value" of it. I missed the straightforwardness of my old reward-and-punishment model, where every detail, no matter how insignificant, had meaning.\r\n\r\nAt Columbia, I faced a familiar dilemma: whether to stop wearing my yarmulke in order to fit in with the college community, like many of my friends. I decided to apply Rabbi Elisha''s philosophy, but could not reach a satisfactory answer. I did not believe there was any value to announcing my separateness every minute of the day when I had so much to learn from my non- religious or non-Jewish fellow students and teachers. With Rabbi Elisha''s model, I was still committed to <em>Halacha</em>, but much more willing to let certain rules lapse, especially when the sociological or human value seemed either absent or outdated. My old outlook explained all of<em>Halacha</em> through a simplistic theological model whereas perhaps my new outlook could not explain it well enough. With Rabbi Elisha''s philosophy, I was simply much more willing to pick and choose which rules of <em>Halacha</em> I wanted to follow. And so, I decided to take off my yarmulke, relegating it to be worn only on the Sabbath or in synagogue.\r\n\r\nGerald Early negotiates an uneasy compromise between his prior faith in Malcolm X''s Afrocentrism and his present American values. Recognizing that "blacks are people of ''double- consciousness''" he argues that "both blackness and American-ness are real options, each having meaning only when measured against the other" (99). His claim is that the entire black community must try to find common ground between Afrocentric separateness and assimilation into mainstream American society.\r\n\r\nBut Early is unclear about how the recognition of this "double-consciousness" can provide any practical path for the black community to follow. What must his daughters change about their lives to rediscover "blackness"? What must his students change to find "American- ness"? Early''s solution is problematic because it implies each African American must handle the struggle as an individual rather than as part of the community. The only thing shared is the existence of these two identities: the "strange, yet poignant and immeasurable, record of an imperishable human presence" (Early 100).\r\n\r\nThe <em>Halacha</em> dilemma is less one of two identities than of motivation; it is thus a more concrete (and perhaps fixable) problem, albeit one that will probably take me many more years to even begin to resolve. I do know, however, that my early teachers did me a disservice by glossing over the question entirely. It took Rabbi Elisha to remind me of the need for a critical engagement with <em>Halacha</em> and its many rules. Other teachers in the Jewish establishment should learn from Rabbi Elisha, and begin acknowledging the complicated questions of what it means to be a <em>Halachik</em> Jew, especially when dealing with elementary and high school students. If the process of learning to think critically and philosophically becomes more mainstream in Jewish education, perhaps more people will be able to make that giant classroom in heaven have meaning on Earth as well.', 'Not Stirring the Soup and Knowing Why: My Search for Meaning in Halacha', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '291-autosave', '', '', '2012-02-27 14:47:54', '2012-02-27 14:47:54', '', 291, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?p=420', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

This is the breathtaking image of Beyoncé Knowles—best known as simply Beyoncé—in the L’Oreal Paris 2008 Feria Ad. Naturally, Photoshop technicians were assigned to retouch the dull, original still shot into this exquisite frame. These skilled wizards may have over-fiddled with their magical enhancements: The final edit features a significantly lighter skinned, almost Caucasian Beyoncé, the natural mocha pigment of the iconic celebrity’s skin somehow faded in the misguided abyss of the editing room. It is ironic that the same female singer who famously coined the term “bootylicious” to praise the voluptuous figures of black women allowed this digitally manipulated white version of herself to represent, or more accurately misrepresent, her black image in a national beauty campaign. Beyoncé gives off the impression of two contradicting images of a black woman: one, a proud, curvaceous woman, and the other, a pale-skinned glamazon. With white standards of beauty dominating the market, black celebrities such as Beyoncé are pressured to create two separate identities to deal with society’s questionable appreciation of the black aesthetic. The question remains: Which identity is a more positive representation of the black aesthetic, one that casts black beauty in the starkest of lights or one that embellishes ethnicity to meet so-called universalizing beauty standards?\n\nAs expected, L’Oreal denied tampering with Beyoncé’s coloring, releasing a statement affirming, “It is categorically untrue that L’Oreal Paris altered Ms. Knowles’ features or skin tone in the campaign for Feria hair color”<a name="0.1__ftnref1"></a><a name="0.1__Hlt157761264"></a> (McMillon). Even so, bell hooks, author of “In Our Glory,” would likely view Beyoncé’s whitened ad as a wake up call to the black community that “the field of representation remains a crucial realm of struggle, as important as the question of equal access, if not more important” (57-8). hooks suggests that blacks use photography to seize control over their own imagery and to combat demeaning representations of blackness created by white racists (59). Applying hooks’ argument, the color distortion of Beyoncé’s skin emphasizes a failure of the image to establish a black “sense of self and identity” (63). The L’Oreal ad highlights the continued white stigma regarding black appearance and that little progress has been made toward appreciating blackness. The physicality of blacks does not fit the exact mold of conventional white beauty standards. Rather than challenging this attitude through positive ethnic representations, Beyoncé’s image instead “promote[s] notions of essence and identity that ultimately restric[t] and confin[e] black image production” (58). hooks argues that the campaign for black representation is stagnant, and this torpor has destructive effects in the formulation of the black identity, causing blacks to simply accept the perceptions of the “dominant culture” and ultimately foster an internalized racism (59).\n\nFair skin and light eyes have long been celebrated by white society, the rarity of these characteristics accounting for their glamour. Society upholds these qualities as aesthetic ideals, and these standards of beauty carry over into white culture’s reception of black beauty. Black beauty is unusual to the white consumer, and thus not preferred when matched up against conventional beauty standards. One black designer commented on the apparent preference for the white aesthetic, “It''s absolutely true that black models will be not as popular for advertising companies and magazine covers as white girls”<a name="0.1__ftnref2"></a> (Eden). Until blacks gradually ease whites into the black aesthetic, blacks will have to adapt themselves to match white conventional ideas about beauty. Therefore, photo-shopping Beyoncé’s complexion may not entirely have been a criticism of black beauty, but rather a conformation of black skin to preexisting standards of white beauty. hooks, however, condemns such acquiescence, maintaining that blacks should not attempt to “remak[e] black bodies in the image of whiteness…[and] attemp[t] to perfect the image for a white-supremacist gaze” (62). She insists that photos should be used “to construct radical identities” and “images of ourselves that transcend the limits of the colonizing eye” (64).\n\nBeyoncé’s lightened black skin tone can be understood as a black desire to be a whiter black. When blacks make the attempt to be whiter in both black and white campaigns, they only contribute to the “colonizing aesthetic.” hooks might argue that intra-black communal rankings based on lightness of skin are “practices that reinscrib[e] colonial ways of looking and capturing the images of the black ‘other’” (62). Confirming hooks’ theories, Beyoncé yielded the opportunity to create an image promoting her ethnicity, and did not help in any way to strengthen the confidence of those blacks who harbor an internalized hatred of their dark skin.\n\nFor this reason, it is perplexing to discover that this same celebrity, who very publicly had her signature face lightened for the L’Oreal ad, previously recorded a nationally famous, chart-topping song that extolled black beauty. In May 2001, in an effort to encourage black women to embrace their fuller figures, Beyoncé, then lead singer of R&amp;B group Destiny’s Child, wrote these iconic words, “I don''t think you''re ready for this jelly. I don''t think you''re ready for this, ''cause my body''s too bootylicious for ya babe.”<a name="0.1__ftnref3"></a> Beyoncé expressed in an interview with IMDb.com that “the song was just telling everyone just forget what people are saying, you''re bootylicious. That''s all. It''s a celebration of curves and a celebration of women''s bodies.”<a name="0.1__ftnref4"></a> The rallying words of the melody embolden black women to be proud and confident about their physical appearance. Praising the black aesthetic, the song is among the first to feature a female artist proposing that a black women’s shapely physique is more attractive to males than the pin-thin frame typically associated with white celebrities. hooks would probably support Beyoncé’s effort to assert black identity and promote distinguishing black qualities as beautiful in their own right. The words of the song have the power “to make the images live” (63) and “announc[e] our visual complexity” (61) to a society that has not thus far opened their eyes to black beauty.\n\nIt seems then that Beyoncé straddles two diametrically opposed identities within the two exhibits – the “Bootylicious” song that glorifies the black aesthetic and the L’Oreal ad that stigmatizes it. Nevertheless, it is not as simple as black or white. It is possible that one could infer the opposite distinction from Beyoncé’s two exhibits. One can interpret the L’Oreal ad as actually the more positive of the two images and the song as more disparaging to black identity. The L’Oreal Ad, though widely perceived to be attacking black aesthetics could potentially be more of a glorification of black beauty than “Bootylicious.” The advertisement depicts Beyoncé as a breathtaking woman with enviable skin and magnificent hair. Even though her complexion is whiter, Beyoncé is still noticeably black in the photograph. Many women that see that photo will wish they looked just like Beyoncé, no matter that she is African American. The L’Oreal ad in no way diminishes her indisputable beauty, but instead gives the white consumer an opportunity to appreciate it. The song “Bootylicious,” however, contains lyrics that characterize black women’s bodies in a carnal and purely sexualized way. The song refers to black woman as though they are just sexual conquests for males. The lyrics describe the black aesthetic using derogatory terminology, casting the black physique in a negative light. Therefore, one can say that an ad that works to reduce the traces of blackness—namely the L’Oreal endorsement—in actuality, applauds the black aesthetic more so than a song that comments on the black female’s curves—namely “Bootylicious”— but disrespects the black figure.\n\nIt is possible that both of Beyoncé’s contradictory exhibitions help in constructing her own black identity. One can speculate that the reasoning for her paradoxical behavior is her desire to appeal to multiple publics. As a celebrity, Beyoncé feels the pressure to appeal to all people, sometimes by obliging societal expectations and sometimes by making controversial claims in lyrics that challenge those very same conventions. For the aesthetic market dominated by ideal beauty standards, Beyoncé knows a whiter image will help sell more products. For the black community, embracing her ethnicity will help captivate her audience. She is able to miraculously be both a black advocate and a white conformist. In a way, Beyoncé is a bridge between the two worlds, paving new grounds in white society’s recognition of ethnic beauty and introducing Caucasian principles to black society. Still, one cannot effectively conclude Beyoncé’s logic behind her seemingly conflicting identities. Why she chooses to be these separate people is beyond what one can theorize about and Beyoncé declined to comment on the L’Oreal scandal. One can only hope that in the future there will be no need for any ethnic figure to create two divergent identities to please separate masses.

(424, 8, '2012-02-27 14:47:56', '2012-02-27 14:47:56', 'Edward W. Said left such a strong impression on Mid-East politics that even his critics defined him as “a familiar face on the network news—an urbane, articulate man, invariably dressed in an elegant suit and tie, who could always be counted on to provide polished, unaccented, pro-Palestinian (or, more generally, pro-Arab or pro-Moslem) spin on recent Mideast developments” (Bawer 620). Yet this “urbane, articulate man” shunned U.S. Media attention after Saudi Arabian nationals hijacked two passenger airlines, and used them as guided missiles in a fatal attack on U.S. soil the morning of September 11th, 2001. If this character, Said, “could always be counted on to provide” his interpretations, or his “spin on recent Mideast developments,” then what were his reasons for withdrawing from the media attention he had previously enjoyed?\n\nAlthough Said did publish a piece in the <em>Observer</em> (a U.K.-based paper) five days after the terror attacks, its somewhat sympathetic stance towards the terrorists was blasted by Bruce Bawer, an independent critic who has written articles for (among others) the <em>New Republic</em>, the <em>Nation</em>, and the <em>New York Times Magazine</em> and whose book reviews have appeared in the <em>New York Times Book Review</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and the <em>Times Literary Supplement</em>. Bawer claimed that after reading Said’s piece in the <em>Observer</em>,\n\none no longer wonders why it appeared in a British newspaper rather than on the op-ed page of Said’s usual high-profile outlet, the <em>New York Times</em>—whose readers, many of them ordinarily receptive to Professor Said’s critiques of Western democracy and whitewashing of Islamic tyranny and terror, were perhaps too busy that week trying to recover from the violent assault on their city to be able to profit from his wisdom.\n\nBawer’s insinuation is that New York City, once the bastion of Said’s liberal pro-Muslim ideals, could no longer afford the luxury of self-criticisms, and thus, had no use for Said’s radical opinions. Could this be why Said avoided U.S. media interviews after the September 11th attacks?\n\nPerhaps an understanding of Said’s tumultuous life could shed light on this question. Said, as he narrates in his memoir <em>Out of Place</em>, was born in 1935 as a Protestant Arab Palestinian in Jerusalem, Palestine. His father was a very successful business man, giving Said a privileged upbringing from which he could observe the events that shaped the modern-day Middle East. He was raised in Cairo, Egypt, where he experienced the direct effects of British, and then American, imperialism. He was able to enjoy summers in Lebanon, where he began to notice the undercurrents of cultural divisiveness that still affect the region. He experienced first-hand the controversial declaration of Israel as a state and the subsequent displacement of countless Palestinians. In 1951 Said began his studies in America at a private New England High School. He continued his American education by attending Princeton, and later Harvard, en-route to a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature. Said remained apolitical until the 1967 war, when a second wave of Palestinian refugees was triggered during a six-day conflict between Israel and the combined states of Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan. This event, and its dire consequences, generated the intense interest in politics, specifically in the creation of a Palestinian state, which Said maintained throughout the remainder of his life.\n\nBut the question remains, why would Said refuse media attention in the days (and years) following 9/11? Why would he pass up such an ideal opportunity to speak to an American public about an issue very dear to his heart? Could Bawer be correct in that Said no longer had a receptive audience?\n\nSaid’s own voice indicates otherwise. Several comments made after September 11th indicate that he withdrew because he feared being presented as a definitive subject matter expert. It was this notion of a subject expert, or a single person who could classify and explain a vast group of cultures, that Said definitively condemned in <em>Orientalism</em>, a book first published in 1976. In fact, one might say that Said’s refusal of media attention was the direct extension of his main argument in <em>Orientalism</em>.\n\nSaid summarizes this argument as the issue of “whether indeed there can be a true representation of anything, or whether any and all representations, because they are representations, are embedded first in the language and then in the culture, institutions, and political ambience of the representer” (<em>Orientalism</em> 272). Said argues in <em>Orientalism</em> that constructs such as the Orient contain inaccuracies because they are created by individuals: individuals with their own political, career, and personal agendas. He feels that these simplified identities (such as the East and the West) involve “the construction of opposites and ‘others’ whose actuality is always subject to the continuous interpretation and re-interpretation of their differences from ‘us’” (<em>Orientalism</em> 332). In other words, the East and West cannot be pointed to as physical entities. Instead, they exist as constructs that allow one group of people to differentiate themselves from another.\n\nSaid criticizes the people who forge on without admitting these subjective interpretations. He observes that within the field of Oriental Studies (whose practitioners are labeled orientalists) there is a predominant view that “such things as an Islamic society, an Arab mind, an Oriental psyche” do exist (<em>Orientalism</em> 301). Said counters this view by claiming that “cultures and civilizations are so interrelated and interdependent as to beggar any unitary or simply delineated description of their individuality” (<em>Orientalism</em> 347). Throughout <em>Orientalism</em> Said argues against broad stereotypes and against “the notion that there are geographical spaces with indigenous, radically ‘different’ inhabitants who can be defined on the basis of some religion, culture, or racial essence proper to that geographical space” (<em>Orientalism</em> 322). Although Said makes extensive use of western generalizations of “the East” he explicitly states in the Afterword (written in 1994) that he is not solely criticizing Western imperialism. Rather, he is using specific examples to rebuke the notion that any large group of people can be adequately defined by their religion, geographic location, or ethnicity.\n\nOne of Said’s post-September 11th fears was that the American public might begin to equate Osama bin Laden (or other extremist figures) with the entirety of the Islamic religion (“Fears”). While bin Laden is certainly representative of a very small subset of Islamic fundamentalists, he does not represent the larger Muslim community. But who would be qualified to speak about the Muslim community? Perhaps a Muslim academic, or better yet, perhaps the Muslim philosopher Akeel Bilgrami, whom Said praised in “Impossible Histories.” Bilgrami is a Professor of Philosophy at Columbia University and has extensively explored the philosophical aspects of how people identify themselves and others. As someone who was raised within the “Eastern” country of India he can shed light on how he regards the Muslim community. In an article titled “The clash within civilizations,” he contends that the majority of Muslims “have no particular desire to perpetrate atrocious (and self-defeating) acts of terrorist violence in Islam’s name, no particular desire to live lives observant in the last detail of Shariah laws, no particular desires to live under the tyrannies of oppressive governments that impose the strictest of Islamic ideologies upon them, such as for instance in Saudi Arabia or Iran” (Bilgrami, “Clash” 88). Bilgrami offers a historical, social, and economic perspective to the problem instead of broadly categorizing the East with sweeping statements. He explains that “most Muslims are not absolutists [his term for fundamentalists] at all, and are in fact deeply opposed to the absolutists in their midst. This is evident in the fact that whenever there have been elections, the ‘fundamentalist’ parties have failed to gain power, whether in Iran or in Pakistan” (Bilgrami, “Lessons” 32). He further interprets the animosity many Muslims feel towards the West as not being directed at freedom or modernity, but rather, at the “naked, corporate-driven wrongs of American and Western dominance of their regions” (Bilgrami, “Lessons” 32). By way of comparison, Said’s critic Bawer claims that “a substantial percentage of Moslems are in fact religious fundamentalists who despise individual liberty and sexual equality, who believe profoundly that all sorts of things should be punished by death, and who readily cheer acts of violence directed against innocent civilians in the West” (Bawer 622).\n\nBawer relies on heavily unsupported generalizations. He claims that “a substantial percentage of Moslems” are fundamentalists without ever citing a figure or where that figure was drawn from. Bilgrami, by contrast, offers a clear account of fundamentalist support by referring to specific elections in Pakistan where fundamentalist groups have consistently received less than ten percent of the popular vote (Bilgrami, “Clash” 90). Bawer, through his broad generalization of Muslims, represents a striking example of the mentality Said condemned in <em>Orientalism</em>. Bilgrami’s approach, however, of carefully examining the conditions surrounding a group, of acknowledging the motivations for their actions, and of treating them as a diverse group represents the tactic that Said supported. But, the distinction between Bawer and Bilgrami is more subtle than it first appears.\n\nFrom the surface it appears that Bilgrami, because he was raised in a Muslim country, can offer valid assertions about Muslims, while Bawer, because he is an outsider, is doomed to hopelessly inadequate generalizations. This misses a fine point of Said’s, that any identity (such as “Muslim”, “Arab”, or “American”) is a constructed image that generalizes a broad group of people. Even though Bilgrami was raised in a Muslim country, his definition of “Muslim” is no more accurate than Bawer’s is. Or rather, his definition is just as hopelessly inaccurate as Bawer’s is. Where Bilgrami does succeed, however, is by attempting to understand that “Muslim” is a man-made term that refers to a large disparate group of people. Bilgrami recognizes that the beliefs held by individuals within this group will vary wildly while Bawer attempts to polarize the group into a black-or-white, either-or, extremist vs. liberal perspective. Said hoped that a humanist understanding such as Bilgrami’s would help prevent “the terrible conflicts that herd people under falsely unifying rubrics such as ‘America’, ‘the west’, or ‘Islam’ and invent collective identities for large numbers of individuals who are actually quite diverse” (“Window”).\n\nBut what does this tell us about our original question? Why did Said choose to avoid post-September 11th U.S. media contact? With a solid understanding of Said’s historical perspective on the bipolar constructs of East and West we can now investigate this question using his own voice.\n\nIn an article published in <em>Harper’s</em> magazine in July 2002, titled “Impossible Histories,” Said assaults the implication that he might have some insight into the events of September 11th. Through a rhetorical question he exclaims “what could I know about the crazed fanatics who committed suicide in the slaughter of innocents” (“Impossible Histories” 69). This is very telling, because it sets up a very clear distinction between Said’s area of knowledge, and the area of knowledge required to understand “the smoldering twin towers” (“Impossible Histories” 69). Said had always proclaimed himself a secularist, so from his perspective he had no insights into the people who flew airplanes into buildings in the name of religious fervor. While he did feel that he had contextual information about the socio-political conditions that might lead a person to attack the United States, he felt that such information was not welcomed by the American populace. Two months after the attacks Said addressed this in an article for the Arab American News. In the article he claimed that “any attempt to place the horrors of what occurred on September 11 in a context that includes US actions and rhetoric is either attacked or dismissed as somehow condoning the terrorist bombardment” (“Fears”). So although Said felt that he could provide contextual information about the events leading to the September 11th attacks, he sensed that this was not what the U.S. media wanted.\n\nInstead, he observes, “bookstores in the US are filled with shabby screeds bearing screaming headlines about Islam and terror, the Arab threat and the Muslim menace, all of them written by political polemicists pretending to knowledge imparted by experts who have supposedly penetrated to the heart of these strange oriental peoples” (“Window”). He further criticizes the media as assigning “itself the role of producing so-called ‘experts’” who then support “the kind of simplified view of the world” that U.S. political strategists have provided (“Window”). Small wonder, then, that Said might not “want to be tokenized or made to represent the ‘other’ point of view” (“Impossible Histories” 69).\n\nBut Said’s refusal to interview with the U.S. media stretches beyond avoiding the label of “other.” His refusal was directed instead at the U.S. notion of providing “experts” to aggregate and summarize disparate regions of the world. Said’s rebellion, then, was not against being labeled as pro-Muslim, but instead it was against the thought that the East could be labeled, and further, that it could actually be objectively described by any one person without understanding the historical, social, and economic context. The U.S. media criticized his contextual information as “condoning terrorism,” yet they still asked him for information. Why? So that they could produce a sensational headline that would drive Americans, out of fear, to purchase more papers, to view more news media, and to further the development of the “us” versus “them” divide. Yet, as was illustrated above, this type of bipolar classification is exactly what Said argued against in <em>Orientalism</em>. So is it any surprise that Said refused U.S. media attention following the September 11th terrorist attacks? Of course not! The only way for Said to maintain his beliefs, as described in <em>Orientalism</em>, was to refuse media attention.\n\nBut how is this knowledge helpful? Said refused to cater to the desires of the U.S. media, and in so doing illustrated that the U.S. media still operates under the assumption that large numbers of people can be grouped together under a single name. This is evident when the media refers to a “Chinese” identity, or a “Muslim” identity. The assumption, then, is that a subject expert can accurately define the attributes of these identities. This categorization, as was explained above, risks oversimplifying many of today’s current events. Said recognized this, and claimed these so-called objective identities were no more than a subjective means of distinguishing one group of people from another as “us” versus “them”. He argued instead that we should investigate the social and economic context in which events occur, and thereby arrive at a more accurate understanding of those events. But, as was illustrated by Said’s dilemma above, the U.S. media does not take this approach. Therefore Said’s legacy, and challenge, to us is to force the media to provide us with the contextual information necessary for a broad understanding of their issues.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBawer, Bruce. “Edward W.

Perhaps most intriguing, though, is W.H. Auden, who sought not only to publish his poems but to control them. Toward the end of his life, Auden constantly reconsidered his poems in an attempt to impose order and decide for himself which pieces would appear in his ultimate canon. While working on his <em>Collected Poems</em>later in life, Auden radically rewrote and even threw away some of his best known poems, arguing that they were boring and dishonest. As a highly intellectual and methodical poet, Auden clearly thought through each of these exclusions, even revealing his rationale, yet this thought process cannot defuse the controversy of removing published work from the public sphere.\n\nIn his early years as a poet, Auden experimented with different political stances and poetic styles—something expected of developing writers. He later revolted against these political agendas, however, attempting to erase such poems from his past and, therefore, his future legacy. According to Auden’s hand-picked literary executor, Edward Mendelson, in his essay “Revision and Power: The Example of W. H. Auden,” Auden deemed these poems deeply revolting and revised an estimated three quarters of his canon. The current events and the needs of the political climate in which he wrote clearly influenced Auden, but he later expressed anxiety that such politically infused poems did not represent his own voice.\n\nIn addition, Auden theorized that the skills required to craft works of art are the same skills that pose danger in politics, leading to campaigns for beautification and sterilization. Thus, Auden felt compelled to revise his political poetry. In “Squares and Oblongs,” his essay on revisionism, Auden writes that the “Orpheus who moved stones is the archetype, not of the poet, but of Goebbels,” and poets should refrain from exercising control over their readers (180). This explains why he refused to include “Spain” and “September 1, 1939,” two of his most famous poems, in his 1965 publication, <em>Collected Shorter Poems 192</em><em>7–1957. </em>According to Mendelson in his aforementioned essay, Auden “did not drop these poems because he disagreed with their politics… but because he distrusted their power to convince his readers that he and they were on the right side in the great struggles of the age” (105). He did not want his poems to be “deceptive” or “flattering” and thus refused to include “September 1, 1939” precisely because he refused to leave open the possibility that his poems would be misused as propaganda (106). Thus, he preferred to destroy some of his most highly regarded poems rather than leave them to misinterpretation.\n\nThis problem of misinterpretation and misuse becomes especially interesting in light of the critical theories of Roland Barthes. In the 1960s and 70s, literary criticism underwent a radical transformation; until then, writing had been viewed as the output of a definite author, who shaped the text with his personal experiences and theories; however, this perspective disappeared with the so-called “Death of the Author,” Barthes’ essay on how the reader’s interpretation of a text matters most. In order to establish this reader, however, Barthes proclaims that the author must die and explains that society should not aggrandize the importance of the author because “To give a text an Author is to impose a limit on that text, to furnish it with a final signified [meaning], to close the writing” (147). In Barthes’ theories, the author and the work come into being together, and the author does not impose any secret meaning or intent on his text; rather, all meaning lies within the text itself, and “The reader is the space on which all the quotations that make up a writing are inscribed without any of them being lost; a text’s unity lies not in its origin but in its destination” (148). Barthes might argue that Auden’s wishes should stay disconnected from his poetry, and that the ultimate meaning of poems like “September 1, 1939” should be derived from their own content. The reader, whose birth Barthes calls for, presents his own troubles, however, since he too may impose questionable theories on the text.\n\nBarthes seems to argue that a text stands alone, rendering all interpretations valid, yet anyone who has been through a high school English class knows that this cannot possibly be true. For instance, after reading Nathaniel Hawthorne’s <em>The Scarlet Letter,</em> a student could argue that Dimmesdale really loves Hester’s daughter, Pearl, or that the scarlet letter itself is a gang sign, or any other number of absurdities. The student could probably even find a few quotations that, taken out of context, support his ridiculous theory. Ultimately, though, any astute reader knows that these interpretations are not and cannot ever be valid. While Auden probably was not thinking about misinterpretations of <em>The Scarlet Letter, </em>his fears followed a similar pattern. He refused to include “September 1, 1939” because he feared that politicians would misinterpret it as glorifying their personal goals and use it for propaganda. In fact, as Mendelson notes, President Lyndon B. Johnson used the poem in a 1964 campaign speech, and, in the 1980s, President George H.W. Bush adapted a few lines to one of his “most deceptive speeches” (110). Thus, with the death of the author, Barthes forgets that there remains the equally frustrating problem of the birth of the reader. Without a definite author who can reshape his work, misuse and misinterpretation become an imminent threat.\n\nYet, poetry is not a commodity to be owned, and, thus, author and owner can never exist together either. According to Barthes, the idea of the author and of writing as ownership emerged after the humanist movement of the Renaissance, yet Barthes urges critics to abandon these notions and view writing as an event that takes place in a “negative where all identity is lost” (142), so that it does not matter who specifically is speaking. Since a definite distance emerges between text and writer, readers need not seek a final, attempted theme or goal in a work.\n\nIn his 1970 essay “What Is an Author?,” Michel Foucault responds to Barthes’ theories and poses his own questions about the idea of the author. Foucault challenges Barthes: “It is not enough, however, to repeat the empty affirmation that the author has disappeared” (105). He demonstrates the importance of the author’s name, which changes in accordance with his work; to explain this, Foucault argues that Shakespeare’s name would take on completely different connotations if historians discovered that he wrote Bacon’s scientific works in addition to his plays and poems. Foucault elaborates, “The author function is therefore characteristic of the mode of existence, circulation, and functioning of certain discourses within a society” (108). Thus, the public’s conception of an author depends on the writings of his that they read. Foucault then addresses the difficulty in defining an author’s “work.” Barthes calls for the death of the author in order to transfer all meaning to the work itself, but Foucault complicates the issue, wondering how to define an author’s “work” and asking “What if, within a workbook filled with aphorisms, one finds a reference, the notation of a meeting or of an address, or a laundry list: Is it a work, or not… How can one define a work amid the millions of traces left by someone after his death?” (103-4). This raises fascinating concerns about Auden’s canon, since, even though he has been dead for thirty-six years, no <em>Complete Poems </em>exists—only Auden’s personally arranged<em>Collected Poems </em>and the more recent <em>Selected Poems</em>.\n\nIn the new <em>Selected Poems</em>—released for Auden’s would-be centennial last year—Mendelson included many of the poems that Auden tried to erase. Mendelson has also edited Auden’s <em>Collected Poems, </em>the controversial publication from which Auden excluded “Spain” and “September 1, 1939.” In his introduction to <em>Selected Poems, </em>Mendelson explains:\n\nThe present selection ... [reprints] the texts of Auden’s early editions and [includes] poems that he later rejected. A historical edition of this kind, one that reflects the author’s work as it first appeared in public rather than his final version of it, is not intended as an argument that Auden’s revisions or rejections were arbitrary or misguided; he had strong literary and ethical motives for choosing them. (xv)\n\nThus, it seems that Auden failed in his quest to permanently reshape his body of work. Currently, his fans and readers may understand his wishes to erase, but they will probably read “September 1, 1939” and “Spain” regardless. If Auden’s very name and reputation depend on the extent of his work, then he would seem to deserve the power that he tries to exert over his poetry. Foucault might argue that “Since literary anonymity is not tolerable,” Barthes’ ideas on the tyranny of the author are invalid, and Auden should be able to claim his own work (109). Foucault seems to support this notion when he includes St. Jerome’s criteria for imposing unity on a number of different works; however, Foucault ultimately concludes his essay by asking “What difference does it make who is speaking?” (120). But if it does not matter who is speaking, it certainly matters that someone is speaking and, consequently, poetry requires a blend between the critical theories of Barthes and Foucault. As Barthes observes, the author should remain distanced from the work, but, as in Foucault, instead of dying completely, the author should remain as a “function.” As the coldness of the term suggests, however, the author function should not rely on any personal or autobiographical characteristics of the author; rather, it should depend on the complex division between author and text. Thus, Auden’s motivations become irrelevant, but his insistence on revision serves to deepen the tension between crafter and craft. Perhaps William Butler Yeats, an important influence on Auden’s work, best captures this relationship when he asks, “How can we know the dancer from the dance?” (“Among School Children,” line 64).\n\nPoet and poems clearly remain divided somehow, though. Whereas Auden’s<em>Collected Poems </em>appeared exactly as he wished during his lifetime, the current status of his canon rests in the hands of his literary executor, who has restored some of Auden’s prized poems now that he is dead. Yet, this raises the question of completeness, because exclusion seems to suggest a body of work that has not yet obtained its final shape. One must wonder which is the more complete: Auden’s certified <em>Collected Poems </em>or the newly expanded <em>Selected Poems. </em>This distinction re-engages Barthes and Foucault, because Auden’s revisionism surpassed the simple editing of words and line breaks and drastically altered the presentation of his theories to the world.\n\nBarthes and Foucault address the question of whether the text exists as a separate entity from its author and, if so, whether Auden’s re-ordering and discarding constitute valid processes. In “What Is an Author?,” Foucault challenges the notion of possession, questioning the distinction between author and owner. In this essay, Foucault also details that “Once a system of ownership for texts came into being… the possibility of transgression attached to the act of writing took on, more and more, the form of an imperative peculiar to literature… thereby restoring danger to a writing which now guaranteed the benefits of ownership” (108-9). As Foucault suggests, the sole ownership of a piece of writing by its writer poses a danger; in Auden’s case this danger is evident in the suppression of key poems. If Auden owns his poems, then he possesses the ability to decide when his canon is complete—or, more accurately, what constitutes his complete canon. Adding another level to the question of ownership, however, Barthes cites Mallarmé, who, he claims, foresaw “the necessity to substitute language itself for the person who until then had been supposed to be its owner” (143). Thus, Barthes might argue that the poems themselves stand alone, and their language fulfills their purpose, which Auden does not own and cannot alter.\nAuden tried to change the intent—or possible uses—of poems such as “September 1, 1939” when he tried to radically change his canon by removing already-published poems from the public sphere. Barthes and Foucault address this idea of text existing in a space as well. In “The Death of the Author,” Barthes explains that “Writing is that neutral, composite, oblique space where our subject slips away, the negative of all identity is lost” (142). For Barthes, the stanza is a room where the door is locked, and as soon as writing begins, a disconnect emerges between poet and poem. Although Barthes only speaks of an individual reader, this disconnect would logically increase when a text enters the public sphere (<em>id est</em>,through publication). Once a poem has reached the public, can it be retracted? It certainly cannot be forgotten. In his introduction to Auden’s <em>Selected Poems,</em>Mendelson himself suggests a duality:\n\nProbably the best way to experience Auden’s work is to read the early versions first for their greater immediate impact, and the revised versions afterward for their greater subtlety and depth. For most readers this book [<em>Selected Poems</em>] will be a First Auden, and the edition of his “Collected Poems” that was published posthumously according to his final intentions may be recommended as a Second. (xv)\n\nEven though the <em>Collected </em>appeared far earlier than the <em>Selected, </em>Mendelson labels it “a Second.” This would seem to suggest that Auden becomes two authors: the poet who produced the political works of the <em>Selected </em>and the poet who compiled the more thematically unified <em>Collected</em>. Interestingly, Foucault defines the author as “a particular source of expression that, in more or less completed forms, is manifested equally well, and with similar validity, in works, sketches, letters, fragments, and so on” (111). Since Auden appears very differently in the two editions of his poetry, he seems to obtain two separate but related canons and, therefore, legacies. Foucault goes even further, claiming that the author function “does not refer purely and simply to a real individual, since it can give rise simultaneously to several selves” (113). Thus, the texts can stand without the true identity of the author who wrote them, and instead each can represent a new “self” for the author function. With the emergence of these selves, however, Foucault seems to represent an occurence more akin to a birth than a death. Yet, even in this new birth of selves, Barthes’ “death” remains as well, because the texts alone represent these identities, allowing for the existence of multiple Audens. There is, of course, Auden the man, who dies within the poems, which themselves represent the Auden of the <em>Collected </em>and the Auden of the<em>Selected</em>—two very different authors. Thus, Auden’s exclusions failed to alter his canon; they merely forged a new body of work, which remains in conversation with his older poems. v\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><br clear="all" /></strong>\n\n<strong>Works Cited</strong><strong></strong>\n\nAuden, W.H. <em>Selected Poems</em>.

(422, 8, '2012-02-27 14:52:29', '2012-02-27 14:52:29', 'On the fourth floor of the Museum of Modern Art, presiding over the central space in one of the many labyrinthine galleries like ancient idols in a temple, sits a collection of Constantin Brancusi’s sculptures. Displayed on a raised white platform, each is honoured with its own pedestal. The group includes a version of his <em>Bird in Space</em> series, a slender, soaring sweep of polished metal; the<em> Endless Column</em> of octagonal forms in dark oak; <em>The Cock</em>—pointed, aggressively angular, also in wood; and <em>Mlle Pogany</em>, a bronze bust of a woman’s highly stylized countenance that retains only a pair of overarching brows tapering down into a thin tip of a nose, a brief, incised line where her mouth should be, and one solitary ear.\n\nSusan Sontag would have appreciated the portrait of Brancusi’s young Hungarian friend. Its surface, burnished to a high, glossy gleam, reflects the viewer back at him/herself—photographs of it nearly always include the photographer also—and, in so doing, emphasizes a semantic duality at play: the mirror-like sheen both reinforces the subject’s self-absorption, her inward gaze, as well as achieving a perfectly smooth, impenetrable exterior, thereby keeping at bay all would deconstruct it, crack its code, or, in Sontag’s words, “dig “behind” the text, to find a sub-text which is the true one” (Sontag 6). In her essay, “Against Interpretation,” Sontag attacks contemporary art criticism, which she views as both misguided and inadequate, for its tendency to “impoverish, to deplete the world­in order to set up a shadow world of “meanings” (7). She takes issue with how the relentless drive to interpret, to assign fixed meanings, has come to replace the direct, immediate sensory perception of any work of art, and a suitable appreciation of its aesthetic values, and the chief culprit, in her understanding of the term, is referred to as the “plucking (of) a set of elements (the X, the Y, the Z, and so forth) from the whole work” so that “X is really—or, really means—A” (Sontag 7, 5). This practice of equating one thing with another, an “idea that is now perpetuated in the guise of a certain way of encountering works of art thoroughly ingrained among most people who take any of the arts seriously”, is illustrated by the film version of Tennessee Williams’<em> A Streetcar Named Desire</em>, a bubbling cauldron of a drama of primal emotions, misrepresented by director Elia Kazan as depicting in microcosm “the decline of Western civilization” (Sontag 5, 9). In place of this proclivity to impose larger, universal meanings, Sontag argues for an approach that puts the focus squarely back where it belongs—form: “What is needed is a vocabulary—a descriptive, rather than prescriptive, vocabulary—for forms. The best criticism, and it is uncommon, is of this sort that dissolves considerations of content into those of form” (Sontag 12). The “highest, most liberating value in art,” she declares, is “transparency,” or what is otherwise referred to (very aptly) as “experiencing the luminousness of the thing in itself” (Sontag 13).\n\nThe sculptures in the MoMA are immediately recognizable as Brancusis. They are starkly and powerfully linear; they are almost wholly abstract representations devoid of any distinguishing biomorphic traits, and as such they lend themselves all too easily to the Sontag-ian exemplar of pure clarity and luminescence, unencumbered by distracting intimations of “content.” Arresting the eye by their sheer, insistent presence, they demand to be noticed, and their elemental configurations—most can be reduced to a few basic, fundamental shapes—and obdurately <em>material</em> surfaces seem to resist any sort of attempt to symbolize, to allegorize and to draw analogies, i.e. to interpret. As Rudolf Arnheim demonstrates in <em>Visual Thinking</em>, however, analysis, both visual and mental, begins with the mere act of looking; our ocular and cognitive faculties share a far closer relationship than is commonly assumed, and to see is, at the same time, to interpret. Human vision is a far from passive activity­it is by nature both “purposive and selective” (19):\n<blockquote>Through that world roams the glance, directed by attention, focusing the narrow range of sharpest vision now on this, now on that spot, following the flight of a distant sea gull, scanning a tree to explore its shape. It may refer to a small part of the visual world or to the whole visual framework of space, in which all presently seen objects have their location […] Some of its aspects build up fast, some slowly, and all of them are subject to continued confirmation, reappraisal, change, completion, correction, deepening of understanding. (14-5)</blockquote>\nThe “deepening of understanding” also involves the processing of information not always available to the faculties, and Arnheim adduces several examples of this phenomenon, one of which is that of our perception of shapes. He asserts that we do not see the actual shape of an object, but fit it, rather, into a pre-existing mental template to which it broadly conforms (termed visual concepts or categories), so that the moon, for instance, which can only be said to be round once a month, is seen as such when it is nearly so at other times. These visual categories also utilize the human penchant for metaphor: a dome might be “hemispherical” (though not quite exactly so), or a long, circular lampshade, “cylindrical.” A woman’s puffy, piled-up hairdo, for which an appropriate adjective is lacking, is called “cumulus-shaped.” Just as words for one object are employed in the service of another, so too does human understanding of the wider world consist fundamentally in the drawing of connections between one phenomenon and the next. We conceive of relationships or likenesses between the tangible and the intangible (“She stabbed me in the back”), for instance, or between people and things (“He’s such a blockhead”), or, to take Sontag’s terms, between X and A.\n\nWhat we conceive of, then, as the unbiased and non-judgmental faculty of perception is actually anything but: “there is, therefore, no difference in principle between percept and concept” (Arnheim 28). The blurring of the divide between objective and subjective ways of seeing was an impulse central to Brancusi’s work—it was the essence of a thing that he wished to capture (indeed, a retrospective of his work organized by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 2004 was titled “The Essence of Things”). <em>Fish</em>, an elongated, streamlined piece of grained marble, is a prime example of this reduction to sensory fundamentals, and Brancusi himself explained it thus: “When you see a fish you don’t think of its scales, do you? You think of its speed, its floating, flashing body seen through the water. Well, I’ve tried to express just that. If I made fins and eyes and scales, I would arrest its movement, give a pattern or shape of reality. I want just the flash of its spirit” (Jianou 14).\n\nArt critic and historian Rosalind Krauss, in her book <em>Passages in Modern Sculpture</em>, also offers an approach to Brancusi’s oeuvre that incorporates within its formalist methodology the possibility of readings on a more particular level. For Krauss, in fact, Brancusi’s works are unequivocally “objects,” possessed of “the beauty and severity of mechanically functional shapes”; these finished, polished products, shorn of any experiential reference—save the evocation of industrial design—invites the viewer to a “peculiar […] contemplation,” “a contemplation as unreceptive to analysis as the polished marble or bronze surfaces are to penetration” (100, 85-6). Form is of the essence here, but forms so uncompromisingly basic, so fiercely minimal, and so inimical to the interpretive act as to constitute a merciless denial of Sontag’s despised meanings, nevertheless, in the case of <em>Beginning of the World</em>, a Brancusi work of 1924, which Krauss dubs a “final reductive statement”, acquires a reckoning of its stringent formal qualities, understood in incongruously organic terms (Krauss 96).\n\nA tapered bronze teardrop, agleam with the characteristic Brancusi polish, it is placed in the center of a circular metal disk, on which its lower half casts a reflection, thereby being, at the same time, the recipient of its own image, reflected by the mirror of the disk’s surface, and swathed in its own shadow. By contrast, the upper half, turned toward the light (of the exhibition space), glimmers and glitters with the play of “myriad and changing visual incidents”, a constantly shifting kaleidoscope of reflected distortions that registers any and all changes in its immediate environment. It is precisely in this contrast of light and dark, movement and stasis, that Krauss locates the affective import of the piece: “It is this differential that gives to the geometry of the form something of a kinesthetic quality that recalls the feeling of the back of one’s head, resting heavily on a pillow, while the face floats, weightless and unencumbered, toward sleep” (Krauss 87).\n\n<em>Mlle Pogany </em>may be expressive of her creator’s predilection for the forceful, fluid line, but her features are, in comparison to<em> Beginning of the World</em>, or to her companions in the MoMA, atypically naturalistic. To do her any justice, to acknowledge her spirit and luminousness, is to describe her in terms of images of sufficient emotional weight. The ovoid head, bearing more than a passing trace of the simian, rests tranquilly on her hands in a gentle downward tilt—the latter are clasped together in the gesture of a supplicant or a daydreaming schoolgirl, and the effect is at once tender and wistful, and suggestive of repose, contemplation, quiet reverie. The mood is interrupted by her neck, a sleek, tubular column thrusting aside with all the rhythmic vigour of pertinacious plant growth, and which imparts to the entirety of the piece its hint of tension and arrested motion; the undercurrent of dissonance is furthered by her precarious perch on the small, square base, a tightrope walker’s delicate balancing act.\n\nConstantin Brancusi was said to have commented of his work: “I offer you pure joy.” And, indeed, he does. A Brancusi epitomizes Sontag’s formulation of “an erotics of art” (14). Sontag may insist upon a thing being only what it is and no more nor less, but she admits also the role that interpretation, as she understands it, plays in the full gamut of human experience: “Interpretation itself must be evaluated, within a historical view of human consciousness. In some cultural contexts, interpretation is a liberating act. It is a means of revising, of transvaluing, of escaping the dead past. In other cultural contexts, it is reactionary, impertinent, cowardly, stifling” (Sontag 7). Arnheim points the way to this unwarranted primacy of the interpretive urge by demonstrating that the dichotomy between perceiving and reasoning—which he attributes to the ancient Greek philosophers—is likewise the result of socio-historical forces, and not quite the natural function it has long been assumed to be. His implicit recognition of the various and varied reactions that any work of art produces, the consequence of complex human vision, is echoed by Krauss’ reading of Brancusi’s work, proceeding as it does from rigorous visual analysis to an affirmation of what are, ultimately, human values. Brancusi speaks to the viewer on multiple levels at once: he piques the curiousity, he stirs the heart; he excites the mind, he enchants the senses; he arouses that unique, particular emotion, that certain luminosity, which only aesthetic satisfaction affords us: joy.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWorks Cited\n\nArnheim, Rudolf. <em>Visual Thinking</em>.

(425, 8, '2012-02-27 14:56:00', '2012-02-27 14:56:00', 'Columbia University loves to promote diversity and points to the multitude of ethnic, religious, political, and other activist groups present on campus as evidence of its wide variety of students. I question, however, whether these clubs promote diversity in practice or actually lead to division between groups. My roommates and I recently attended a party at a local bar hosted by the Korean Student Association. Dates with members of the group were being auctioned to raise money to support local public schools. We are not members of the club, but Adam, our friend’s brother, was being auctioned as a representative of Columbia’s Student Council, and we went to watch and support him. Adam was the only non-Korean on the auction block. At least 75% of the audience was Korean; almost everyone else was just tagging along with friends. This scene is not unusual. The same organizations heralded as the foundation of campus diversity rarely attract a diverse group of members. Korean students join the Korean Student Association, Jewish students join campus Hillel, homosexuals join the Queer Alliance, and Republican voters join Columbia College Republicans. Our pride in having so many diverse groups fades when we realize that these groups are more homogeneous that we like to believe.\n\nRichard Rodriguez sees the same trend involving the homosexual population in San Francisco. In his essay “Late Victorians,” Rodriguez gives a personalized history of the gay community in California. He describes the attitude toward homosexuality in general, toward gay households and families, toward gay artists and interior designers, and the San Franciscan reaction to the AIDS epidemic. Rodriguez also understands and explains the cultural and socioeconomic boundaries that define the separate boroughs of San Francisco. He describes neighborhoods known as the “homosexual address in San Francisco” (126). Other neighborhoods are the “black and working-class parts of the city” (Rodriguez 122). Each neighborhood has its own identity and its inhabitants rarely have close connections with people from outside areas. Vivian Gornick sees the same division between ethnicities in New York City. In “On the street: nobody watches, everyone performs,” Gornick wanders through the city experiencing the rich variety of cultures. She recalls interactions with a writer on her block, two “tough old Jewish guys” on Greenwich Avenue, a black couple on Ninth Avenue, and many different kinds of people at various points along her journey (3). She is aware that individual “neighborhoods accumulate personalities” (18). She pins the fabulously wealthy to Park Avenue, the bourgeois to West End Avenue, and the remnants of bohemia to her area of Greenwich Village. Just like in San Francisco, New Yorkers stay within their neighborhoods and rarely venture out into relationships with people from other areas.\n\nHuman beings are by nature extremely xenophobic. People with a common trait or background tend to group together for support and comfort, and they rarely reach out to other groups. Each community is expected to take care of its own members. The Korean Student Association has its own parties for its members, and other clubs at Columbia have their own programs. Gornick seems to be the exception for her ability to blend in and involve herself with so many types of people. However, even she is shocked when she happens to spot “someone from [her] block…in another neighborhood and the first impulse of the brain is, What are you doing here?” (2) I had a similar reaction when I happened to see a classmate on my subway in the area outside Columbia campus. Both Gornick and I expressed our shock with surprised laughter and a friendly greeting before continuing on our way. Unfortunately, in other situations, this shock is more controversial and far less friendly.\n\nRodriguez experienced the transition of the San Franciscan homosexual community from a discreet lifestyle hidden in bars on Polk Street to a vibrant, flamboyant culture on Castro Street. As the population of gay men in California grew, the classic Victorian homes of the area were divided up into apartments for these non-traditional households. The growing population of homosexuals in San Francisco was not welcome in these areas. They were seen as “blockbusters” that were destroying “the discreet compromise” between the different neighborhoods of a “tolerant city” (Rodriguez 122, 126). As soon as a couple arrived and began to fix up their new home, the neighbors would express their shock at seeing gays outside their traditional neighborhood with an “anonymous reply…on the sidewalk out front: KILL FAGGOTS” (Rodriguez 123). This xenophobic response stems from common stereotypes and over-generalizations.\n\nRodriguez contends that “society’s condemnation forced the homosexual to find his redemption outside nature”—namely, fashion and interior decorating. Homosexual interior decorators are attempting to “make up” for their sexual orientation by performing a useful service for the greater community. This is a prime example of Federico García Lorca’s essay “Play and Theory of the Duende.” Duende—the passion that appears in great art—is discovered only after great struggle and conflict. Art produced with duende reveals “the culture, the sensitivity of a people who discover man’s best anger, bile, and weeping” (Lorca 58). The community of gay decorators, painters, dancers, and other artists described by Rodriguez has definitely seen the worst of human beings’ anger and negativity. Finding and using duende to produce art is like “crying tears of blood” (Lorca 61). This is easily applicable to the artistic homosexual population of San Francisco, whose members have to bear people who pity them—“they don’t seem real, poor darlings”—and dismiss them and their supporters as infantile “yuppies” (Rodriguez 127). At the same time, they have to deal with the terrors of the AIDS epidemic and the grief of losing their partners and friends to such a horrific death. All of this opposition has given the homosexual the duende needed to succeed in the art world. This impulse to “challenge the rule of nature” is actually a pure expression of duende (Rodriguez 124).\n\nDuende is not confined to interior decorating and visual art; “Duende is a power not a work” (Lorca 49). This power can be seen in the tremendous response of Californians to the AIDS crisis. The horrors of AIDS quickly spread throughout the entire city of San Francisco and enveloped the heterosexual as well as the homosexual community. In a united effort containing streaks of duende, the city came together to fight this evil. Rodriguez vividly defines the far-reaching effects of AIDS:\n<blockquote>[I]ts victims were as often black, Hispanic, straight. Neither were Charity and Mercy only white, only male, only gay. Others came. There were nurses and nuns and the couple from next door, co-workers, strangers, teenagers, corporations, pensioners. (133)</blockquote>\nThis type of communal duende appears whenever groups have each cried “tears of blood” and come together to fight a common evil (Lorca 61). Gornick relates several experiences that stand out for the deep connection formed between herself and inhabitants of different neighborhoods, both literal and figurative. One such example is the brief conversation she has with a “skinny, young, black” man in the middle of Times Square. A young boy had just committed suicide in front of them by lying down in the road in front of oncoming traffic. In emotional shock, Gornick turns to a member of the boy’s community for support and explanation. This brief bond between the two worlds sprang up as a direct result of a common tragedy. Later, Gornick recalls the night that her neighbor’s husband dies. Although they live in the same building, the two women never speak and appear to live in two different worlds. One night, Gornick sees the woman crying in the lobby in deep distress over the loss of her husband. In the face of such a crisis, the two very different women come together to support each other and to offer help and encouragement.\n\nThe Korean Student Association charity date auction showed duende on a smaller scale. Students from different groups all came together to raise money for public education. The current problems in the public school system affect everyone, and Columbia students rose above ethnic lines to support this worthy cause. In the face of a common enemy, divisions between clubs no longer mattered. My friends and I were welcome at the KSA party because it was supporting a mutual interest. Through our efforts to support public education, a community was formed that crossed cultural, religious, racial, and political boundaries. These new friendships, however brief, were filled with duende that will push the effects of our efforts higher than we could have hoped to achieve as individuals.\n\n“Where is the duende?” asks Lorca (62). It is in the pure sense of community responsibility that drives all different types of people to overcome their xenophobia and learn “to love what is corruptible” (Rodriguez 134). It is what connects the people walking with Gornick on the streets of New York and what pulls all the individual clubs at Columbia together to form a vivid diversity fair. It allows my roommates and me to feel accepted at the Korean Student Association’s charity auction. And it drives the homosexual community in San Francisco to find its niche in the artistic sphere in California. Each community still maintains its own individual identity and territory, but a mutual bond of tolerance is formed whenever different groups face a common obstacle and put aside their disagreements to work together to produce a solution filled with societal duende.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWorks Cited\n\nGornick, Vivian. <em>Approaching Eye Level</em>.

(426, 8, '2012-02-27 14:57:02', '2012-02-27 14:57:02', '<strong>T</strong>he importance of sovereignty—the ownership of authority in one’s own domain—is a central tenet in Walker Percy’s “The Loss of the Creature,” the second chapter in his book <em>The Message in the Bottle: How Queer Man Is, How Queer Language Is, and What One Has To Do with the Other</em>. According to Percy, we have surrendered our sovereignty to any number of experts, and we “receive experience” (54) as filtered through their opinions and observations. We waive the right to see and know for ourselves, and instead use others’ stories, photographs, and experiences to formulate our own ideas, never confronting the actual thing ourselves. He describes the impossibility of truly seeing when fettered by the constraints of the “preformed symbolic complex” (47), which is, essentially, the baggage that we bring to an experience. He spends much of the essay demonstrating the extent to which we have relinquished our access to our own experiences, and offering solutions for how we might regain this primacy.\n\nOur challenge, according to Percy, is to overcome the “preformed complex” in order to recover the ability to truly see and experience. While his premise is sound, a lengthy observation in a preschool might have altered Percy’s mission. Percy overlooks young children, a huge segment of our population that is, for a time, largely untouched by this phenomenon of loss of self-determination. They often have the ability to see without the interference of prefabricated mental images, and do not easily surrender their own authority to anyone. Why does Percy not consider that if we focus on the very young, sovereignty might be protected and fostered from the start rather than restored only after its destruction?\n\nIn the preschool, the individual’s sovereignty enjoys an unfettered reign. This is evident on a very basic level when a child asks me, her teacher,“Did Sam go out?”  When I answer that her friend is still inside, I am initially surprised to feel her push past me to look for him herself. Then, I remember where I am. As the little girl returns, she announces, “You’re right. He isn’t out there.” Among the four and under set, neither my advanced age, nor elevated stature, nor superior status in our classroom is particularly important. While she trusts me, this child must still see for herself that her friend is not where she believes him to be. Moreover, she clearly sees her agreement as something that increases my credibility in this exchange! There is no evidence of this non-expert surrendering her right to do her own “seeing.”\n\nPreschoolers are that rare segment of the population in which deference to “a privileged knower’s” (54) expertise at the expense of one’s own is an abomination rather than the norm. In this window of time in early childhood, each opinion, or certainly one’s own opinion, is critical in determining the correct solution to a given problem. It is not, in this case, redundant to refer to a “correct solution.” While only one answer satisfies the question, “How many...?” the confident, young child is as apt to question an adult’s counting as her own. There is always room for interpretation, and the most meaningful and truest response is one’s own. What another has determined may or may not be useful to him, or may be stored away for proving or refuting at another time.\n\nOften the small child plainly notices what we do not. A three-year-old, for example, having heard an unfamiliar word, asks her mother, “What is a louse?” Her parent, a scientist, gives a textbook definition of the creature, and we are all stunned when her child (who does not wash or comb her own hair) brightly replies, “I know that kind of thing. Actually, I think I have a louse!” She is correct, but having no prior knowledge of the reputation of the parasite, she experiences delight rather than alarm about this fact. As Percy might predict, the mother has a clear grasp of what the specimen called “a louse” is but does not seem to have a practical use for this information, as it does not help her to see the vermin before her very eyes. Conversely, the child actively discovers that she knows what an actual louse is, even if she is only now learning the word. Her ability to see has not yet been compromised—it is certainly not lost.\n\nAccording to Percy, an adult can regain the ability to see. Percy identifies a dialectical tension between access and planning that, he claims, makes seeing virtually impossible when any template is followed. The thing is packaged for consumption—in the case of a lesson, a tourist site or a specimen—and the non-expert becomes a consumer of that pre-packaged knowledge. When someone’s theory supplants a thing for us rather than supplementing our understanding of it, we surrender our sovereignty and defer to a “privileged knower” (54). The meaningful experience garnered by actual confrontation with an object—“penetration of the thing itself” (47)—is lost, and we become consumers of others’ ideas. In the event that we recognize our loss, recovering sovereignty is possible by forging altogether new paths, by delving deeply into a familiar one, or by experiencing a misfortune that disrupts one’s intended means of access. By Percy’s logic, this mother will forevermore be able to identify a louse! Yet, the young child who has not yet succumbed to inevitable consumerism has immediate access.\n\nThe child becomes the authority on her own surroundings and interests by observation rather than by acceptance of others’ ideas. When motivated by curiosity and guided by their own eyes and ears, children often make accurate inferences based upon their own interpretations of their experiences. They seem to assume the role of ultimate authority with far less effort than their adult counterparts; eavesdrop on a small child and you will find that many ideas are prefaced by exclamations like “Here’s a great idea!” or “I know!”  or the loud command “LET ME SEE!” How might we foster and maintain this exuberance in preschoolers so that it remains beyond the earliest years? Must this sense of the unassailable validity of one’s own opinions, interpretations and accomplishments be lost?\n\nThe answer is that some amount of this childlike quality must indeed be lost: what is a perfectly acceptable degree of narcissism in a young child is a character defect in an adult. The goal then would be to bring these enviable qualities—confidence, originality and fidelity to one’s own ideas—into balance with the ability to appreciate the contributions of others. The aim would be for the child to weigh and synthesize another’s input without completely subordinating his own. The empathy and discernment ideally exemplified in an adult might be elicited without bringing the small child down a notch, or by “teaching” in a manner that inspires self-doubt. Watching and listening to children reveal how much they comprehend and cobble together without our intervention. What if we allowed them to formulate the questions before we offered up the answers? In a perfect world, there would be a fusion of the child’s own sovereign impressions and the carefully weighed viewpoints of others, none considered to be the expert, as the emphasis would be placed squarely upon the interconnectedness of the knower and the facts of what is known.\n\nThe loss of sovereignty gradually occurs as a child is increasingly allied with conventional viewpoints, but for the first five years or so most children are content to march to their own internal rhythms. Only after years of observing the ways of the world does the child begin to alter himself to suit established tastes: tantrums are abandoned in favor of “appropriate” behavior, self-consciousness and modesty develop, the awareness that sometimes there is only one correct answer becomes indelibly imprinted on the mind, we stop trying things that might look foolish. The child’s sense of sovereignty is undone bit by bit on a daily basis: we correct pronunciation rather than merely modeling the real words, reject mismatched clothing choices, “teach” them things they will almost certainly learn again later rather than engaging them in subjects that are relevant to their current daily lives. We use “big girl” and “big boy” as forms of the highest praise, we boast of their precociousness and label normal behavior the “terrible twos.” We applaud their ability to mimic and recreate symbols—representations of letters, numbers and objects—but are hardly as enthusiastic in our praise of originality, color choice or vigor. I am suddenly especially cognizant of this tendency during my own gut-wrenching art classes.\n\nI recently began taking a basic drawing class. My classmates run the gamut from first-year students fulfilling requirements to older professionals with an interest in learning new skills. I do not think that any one of us would identify him- or herself as an artist. Our first assignment was to “do some scribbling” in order to loosen up our hands. There was a pervasive sense of discomfort in the room. I saw others steal furtive glances at my sketchpad, as I silently wondered if I was even doing it correctly. I relate this discomfort to the most prevalent lapse in sovereignty witnessed among preschoolers: the loss of authority over their own creative efforts.\n\nWhile three- and four-year-olds are usually overwhelmingly comfortable with their own opinions about a multitude of topics, there is one very common exception: many relinquish that autonomy in regard to their drawings and paintings. In preschool, “scribble” or “scribble-scrabble” is a double-edged description of someone’s artwork. While sometimes it is used to indicate a fact—that the drawing is random and non-representational—it is more often a condemnation that the maker cannot yet draw a realistic approximation of a three-dimensional object. As soon as they are able, many children give up the practice of daring, free-form self-expression in favor of rote representations of universally appreciated hearts, rainbows and bright yellow suns with distinctive rays.\n\nMany of us—children and adults—have traded our unique modes of self-expression for the praise of cherished experts—friends, teachers, siblings and parents. The child who abruptly abandons scribbling in favor of praise-garnering rainbows resembles Percy’s sightseer. The artist no longer experiences the pleasure of discovery, but merely experiences the satisfaction of having the representation conform to the ideal, or, in the case of non-conformity, displeasure at it not being “what it is supposed to be” (47). Some of us give up, dubbing ourselves “bad artists.” Over time, this type of criticism of one’s own expertise and deference to others’ begins to bleed into an increasing number of situations. Soon we are not unlike Percy’s tourists upon arrival at an anticipated site: unhappy at the perceived limitations of our abilities, dissatisfied on account of the disparity between actuality and our expectations (47). Is there any way to avoid this outcome? How might we adapt our way of relating to children that might inure them to the seemingly inevitable loss of self-determination? And what could be gained by encouraging children to maintain this sense of sovereignty?\n\nPercy ultimately exhorts the educator “to help the student to come to himself not as a consumer of experience but as a sovereign individual” (63). Yet, does this not sound suspiciously similar to that about which Percy warns us? Entrusting teachers with the duty of restoring the student’s sovereignty is akin to the foxes guarding the henhouse—in effect, leaving the deprogramming of the students to one faction of brainwashers. Is this not exactly what Percy describes as “the surrender of the horizon to those experts within whose competence a particular segment of the horizon is thought to lie” (55)? What if we took it on as a societal responsibility rather than giving the authority to any one group of individuals?\n\nIf we all were to commend the complexity and ingenuity of the thought process as much as we do the correct answer, if we all were to explore and dissect failed attempts with the same fervor as successful ventures, if we all were to truly appreciate the labor and processes involved in learning, would the sheer numbers of innovative solutions to the world’s woes increase exponentially? What if the next time a child starts playing alone, we watch her as intently as she watches us, and give the undivided attention she craves without overshadowing her efforts? It is, perhaps, impractical to think of indulging each child’s every intellectual whim, or even to follow most interesting ideas to fruition or to the point of fizzling out, but it is also bound to be unnecessary. Given proper encouragement and consistent interest, children would be motivated to pursue their own paths independently, just as an adult is motivated to do work that is worthwhile. What if it were the norm to think “outside the box” because no box had been established? Rather than a handful of innovators, perhaps we would have multitudes! What would Walker Percy think of that?\n\nPercy, Walker. “The Loss of the Creature.” In <em>The Message in the Bottle: How Queer Man Is, How Queer</em><em> Language Is, and</em><em> What One Has To Do with the Other</em>.

(429, 8, '2012-03-23 15:54:56', '2012-03-23 15:54:56', 'The period between 1930 and 1950 represents a paradigm shift in Americans’ thinking about race and its status in public discourse. It was during this time that the prevailing ideology of the Reconstruction era—white supremacy—was overtaken by a new ideology of “color-blindness” or “race-neutrality.” Admittedly, it is unlikely that the average American at this time would have recognized this transformation. However, chances are good that if our average American was a magazine reader, he would have been exposed to the direct effects of this ideological shift through his reading of articles about jazz. Changes in the portrayal of jazz musicians in magazines from 1930 to 1950 are closely associated with concurrent changes in racial ideology. Whereas the explicitly racist discourse of magazine writers in the thirties reflects the poisonous ideology that dominated at the turn of the century, coverage from the forties partakes of the dominant “color-blind” ideology that continues to influence public discourse even today.\n\nThe 1930s marked the tail end of what historians have termed the “nadir of race relations” in the United States.1 This period, extending from roughly 1890 to 1940, marked the height of white oppression of African Americans after the abolition of slavery. The virulent racism of the Nadir was abetted by the spurious “science” of the eugenicists and social Darwinists who dominated the scientific discussion of race at the turn of the century. Race, according to these scientists, was a discrete, biological feature responsible for determining an individual’s intelligence, disposition, and sexual behavior (Omi 14). Scientifically unsound comparative studies of IQ allowed eugenicists to claim that European (and particularly Nordic) intellectual superiority over other races was genetic. Comparative studies of white and black physiology allowed social Darwinists to suggest that whites were more evolved than other races (Sitkoff 191). Taking their cue from their colleagues in the sciences, historians set about the task of rewriting history to adequately reflect the supposed superiority of the white race.\n\nParadoxically, it was during the Nadir, when defenders of white supremacy were resorting to scholarly acrobatics to avoid attributing anything of cultural value to blacks, that jazz first became popular with white Americans. In the Roaring Twenties, jazz’s origins in the African American community only increased its appeal, if not for the nation’s conservative cultural critics then for a younger generation of white Americans. They regarded jazz as emblematic of rebellion against the staid cultural mores of the older generation. That jazz was played by black musicians in illegal speakeasies and allowed for “close” (that is, sexual) dancing made it seem all the more exotic and transgressive.\n\nBy the 1930s, jazz’s transgressive appeal had been mitigated by Swing music’s admittance into the white mainstream. Band leaders such as Duke Ellington and Fletcher Henderson popularized swing in performances at urban nightclubs and large dance halls which, in the South at least, were segregated. The musicians themselves, however, were both white and black, with black band leaders such as Ellington and Count Basie enjoying at least as much success as white band leaders like Benny Goodman. Indeed, Louis Armstrong, the most celebrated and recognized Swing musician of that era, was African American.\n\nTo the extent that magazines covered jazz in the years prior to 1930, it was to denigrate it and the musicians who played it in the explicitly racist rhetoric characteristic of the Nadir. As Maureen Anderson points out in her article “The White Reception of Jazz in America,” mainstream critiques cast jazz as the music of primitive and crude savages, dangerous because it encouraged listeners to revert to their animalistic instincts. As a critic in <em>Literary Digest </em>wrote in 1917, “The groups that play for dancing, when colored, seem infected with the virus that they try to instill as a stimulus in others” (qtd. in Anderson 136). A writer for <em>Current Opinion</em> in 1919 continued the assault on the jazz musician when he wrote of musician Jasbo Brown that, “when he imbibed freely of gin, which was his favorite pastime, he had a way of screaming above the melody with a strange barbaric abandon” (qtd. in Anderson 140).\n\nJournalists in the 1930s, though generally more positive towards jazz and jazz musicians, nevertheless continued to partake of this racist discourse, though it could be argued their racism was of a more subtle variety than that of their predecessors. Nadir-era rhetoric was now deployed under the pretense of objectively “explaining” jazz to readers or else was dismissed as “all in good fun.” The authors of “Hot Jazz Jargon,” published in <em>Vanity Fair</em> in 1935, for example, offer readers a racist assessment of jazz music and jazz musicians under the guise of explaining jazz jargon. Another <em>Vanity Fair</em> article of the same year, entitled “Louis Armstrong,” is written entirely in an affected “black” dialect that author Hermann Deutsch evidently intended readers to find humorous. The article is billed as “semi-fiction” and loosely relates the circumstances of Louis Armstrong’s boyhood in New Orleans. The opening lines set the tone for the entire piece: “Hayah pappy! Hayah mammy! Hayah de gal chillen and de boy chillen all both!” Deutsch recognizes that Armstrong, a black musician in Jim Crow America, plays to audiences in the South that are entirely white, a fact that he seems to interpret as a bellwether of racial change: “White folks in de white light—Black folks in de black light—All but Louis Armstrong—He in de white light too, now. It ain’t like it useter be, brudders and sisters1” (70). Of course, the great irony is that the very existence of this offensive article delineates the very real limits within which Armstrong was forced to work.\n\n<em>Esquire</em>’s fictional “Impossible Interview” of the next year uses dialect to similar effect. The “interview,” a regular feature in <em>Esquire</em>, pitted two cultural icons against each other in a fictional discussion. In this case, Louis Armstrong stands opposite the popular white classical violinist Fritz Kreisler. There is no doubt that the contrast between Armstrong’s dialect and Kreisler’s normative English was intended to be comical, though it branded Armstrong as the uneducated one in the debate. However, the attitude of the author toward jazz musicians in general might be construed as positive; with encouragement from Louis, Fritz begins to “swing” “The Moonlight Sonata” and declares: “Maybe there’s something to this swing business after all” (“Impossible 33). The author suggests white musicians might learn something from black jazz musicians, but he seems also to imply that jazz is legitimated only by white approval. Armstrong is portrayed as a grinning, happy-go-lucky, Uncle Tom who, in declaring “I don’ wanna be in no symphony. I wanna swing,” betrays a lack of sophistication and an inability to appreciate forms of “high art” (“Impossible” 33).\n\nNadir-era racism was already on its way out by the 1930s. Criticism of the eugenicists’ and social Darwinists’ conception of race came from a group of social scientists headed by the eminent American anthropologist Franz Boas. How did anthropologists become caught up in a debate heretofore dominated by biologists? The historian Peggy Pascoe offers an explanation:\n<blockquote>[F]or social scientists, the attack on racialism was not so much an end in itself as a function of a larger goal of establishing “culture” as a central social science paradigm. Intellectually and institutionally, Boas and his followers staked their claim to academic authority on their conviction that human difference and human history were best explained by culture.” (53)</blockquote>\nSocial scientists began their assault by refuting the claim that race was a discrete biological characteristic. The claims of scientific racism had rested on the biological purity of racial categories, but Nadir-era scientists had failed to arrive at a comprehensive list of discrete races. In fact, the number of identified races had continued to mushroom over the course of the nineteenth century as new categories were created to accommodate exceptions to the pre-existing metric. Social scientists exploited this weakness. The fact that, throughout history, people of differing ancestry had crossed paths and procreated, Boas pointed out, made the idea of discrete racial categories patently ridiculous. Finally, in a series of groundbreaking studies, Boas, Aldous Huxley, Lancelot Hogben, and Theodore Dobzhansky proved the degree of genetic variation within and between races to be roughly comparable (Sitkoff 193-4).\n\nOther studies attacked claims that whites were both more evolved and more intelligent then blacks. The social Darwinists’ assertion that physical differences—for example, in hair texture and degree of jaw protrusion—between whites and blacks indicated that whites had progressed further evolutionarily, was upset by a study reinterpreting the same data to indicate black evolutionary superiority. Psychologist Otto Klineberg’s IQ studies undercut social Darwinists’ claims about white inborn intellectual superiority. The IQ test, his studies concluded, did not actually measure inborn intelligence. Rather, higher scores correlated with higher education levels and high socioeconomic status. Only a cultural explanation of intelligence, Klineberg argued, could account for the fact that blacks in the North often outscored whites in the South on IQ tests (Sitkoff 191-2).\n\nBy the late 1940s, the popular conception of race had been so radically undercut that many intellectuals were calling for race to be banned from public discourse entirely. In a 1941 issue of the<em> Journal of Heredity</em>, British anthropologist Ashley Montagu argued that race should be abandoned for the following reasons:\n<blockquote>(1) that it is artificial; (2) that it does not agree with the facts; (3) that it leads to confusion and perpetuation of error, and finally that for all these reasons it is meaningless or rather more accurately such meaning as it possesses is false. Being so weighted down with false meaning it were better that the term be dropped than that any attempt should be made to give it new meaning.” (qtd. In Sitkoff 191)</blockquote>\nEven biologists seemed to agree. Julian Huxley wrote that “the question begging term race [should] be banished . . . from all discussion of human affairs” (qtd. In Sitkoff 191).\n\nColor-blindness was born out of this desire to relegate race to the sidelines of public discourse. It encouraged Americans to ignore or at least de-emphasize race as a significant factor in people’s lives. Race might still have been a problem, but it was a problem with a built-in solution: the success that Irish and Jewish immigrants had had in assimilating into mainstream American culture would, many Americans felt, inevitably be repeated by African Americans. Slavery had set them back in this process, but that roadblock had since been removed. All that was left for Americans to do to facilitate black assimilation into the normative culture was to ignore race and let the problem solve itself. Needless to say, the shift toward a color-blind ideology did<em> not</em> represent a wholesale abandonment of the idea of race. As Jon Panish explains, “The not-so-subtle message encoded in color-blindness . . . is that white and black Americans should begin to move away from the stigmatized category of blackness to the privileged, unmarked category of whiteness” (6).\n\nColor-blind discourse began to emerge in mainstream magazine coverage of jazz in the years after WWII. By this time, Swing could no longer claim the undivided attention of the press; Bebop was taking over. A new avant-garde style of jazz pioneered by a younger generation of musicians, Bebop was largely a response to what musicians criticized as the “sticky” sweetness of popular Swing music. Developed during after-hours jam sessions at Minton’s jazz club in Harlem, it was fast, frenetic, incorporated unusual new harmonies, and often had no discernible melody. Trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie and saxophonist Charlie Parker were Bebop’s primary innovators, but it was Dizzy who became the ambassador of Bop in the mainstream magazine press. Richard O. Boyer’s use of color-blind discourse in <em>The New Yorker</em>’s July 1948 profile of Dizzy is marked. He reports that Dizzy’s fans, “both white and black” describe him adoringly using the same, characteristically “bop” slang. Dizzy, they say, is “real crazy,” “a bitch,” and “a killer” (28). Boyer associates black jazz musicians and their black fans with cultural movements revered by <em>The New Yorker</em>’s intellectual, and mostly white, readership. “Many of the Negro adherents of bebop” he writes, “take a subsidiary interest in psychoanalysis and abstract art” (28). When musicians have received formal musical training, Boyer mentions it. In fact, he continually offers up an image of the jazz musician as a thoughtful intellectual, someone with whom <em>New Yorker </em>readers might presumably identify. He describes the Bop pianist Thelonious Monk as “scholarly” and quotes him as saying “We [Bop musicians] liked Ravel, Stravinsky, Debussy, Prokofieff, Schoenberg, and maybe we were a little influenced by them” (30). He attempts to offset the popular stereotype that bop music was fueled by jazz musicians’ drug habits, emphasizing Gillespie collaborator Gil Fuller’s “impeccable morals” and relaying Fuller’s view that claims of drug use were “a gross and gratuitous libel” (29).\n\nWhen a discussion of the racism Jazz musicians faced becomes unavoidable, Boyer’s language becomes either vague or light and dismissive. He notes, for example, that “many Negro boppers like to pretend that they are Arabs,” assuming Arab-sounding names and wearing turbans. Thelonious Monk, he says, “sometimes forgets that he was born of West Sixty-Third Street and announces that he is a native of Damascus” (31). His joking tone trivializes what he clearly recognizes as an attempt by black jazz musicians to escape the racism to which they were regularly subjected. When he reveals that Dizzy dons a turban from time to time when abroad, he speaks of him “[appreciating] this flight from harsh reality,” (31) leaving readers to infer just what the nature of Dizzy’s reality might be. He goes on to attribute the Islamic conversions of many boppers to a desire to escape what he vaguely calls “their American environment” (31).\n\nThat intellectuals at <em>The New Yorker</em> would be responsive to color-blind discourse may not be surprising, but this same gesture is discernible in <em>Life</em>’s photo essay of a few months later. A series of thirteen glossy photos, appearing in the magazine’s regular feature “<em>Life</em> Goes to a Party” document what readers are led to believe constitute the scenes of Dizzy Gillespie’s everyday life. In one, Dizzy jams with other jazz musicians, including the white pianist Mel Powell. In another, he signs publicity shots for white female fans who, in imitation of him, wear blue berets, thick-framed black glasses, and fake goatees. Shots taken at Billy Berg’s Hollywood nightclub show the popular white singer Mel Tormé and actress Ava Gardner (wearing her own beret, glasses, and fake beard) enjoying Dizzy’s show and socializing with the musician. One cannot imagine a more compelling illustration of mainstream white approval of the black jazz musician.\n\nHowever much magazine writers or photojournalists partook of color-blind discourse, it was not enough to fully overcome their opposing tendency to “otherize” black jazz artists. Bop musicians were too often portrayed one-dimensionally as adherents of an exotic and entertainingly coded subculture. The role of the white magazine writer was to interpret, often humorously, the curious behavior of the beboppers for their white readership. In the <em>Life</em> photo essay, for example, a series of four photographs illustrates the “Bebop Greeting.” The first photo depicts Dizzy and fellow musician Benny Carter greeting each other with what the caption explains are typical bop salutations: “Bells, man! Where you been?” Next they flash “the flatted fifth” hand signal (which the author explains is a note common in bebop), and shout “Eel-ya-dah!” (in imitation of bebop triplet notes), before finally gripping one another’s hands in the last panel. The caption wryly explains that it is only after completing this “ritual” that beboppers can “converse” (139). With an air of theatricality, the author refers to Dizzy’s beret, glasses, and rumpled suit as “the boppers’ required costume” (139). Musicians’ Islamic beliefs function as another entertaining aspect of their subculture, necessitating yet another set of complex rituals exotic to white readers. A photo depicts Gillespie (who was not actually Muslim but Bahá’í) at home in his Hollywood apartment bowing prostrate towards Mecca. The caption explains that beboppers who have converted to Islam often “interrupt rehearsals at sunset to bow to the east (142).\n\nThus while magazine articles about jazz musicians during the period 1930 to 1950 show a distinct trend away from the racial discourse of the Nadir to the color-blind discourse of the 1940s, this does not mean racial discourse was abandoned. There remained a tendency to exoticize the jazz musician—to emphasize rather than downplay racial difference. In articles that self-consciously adopt the discourse of color-blindness, the importance of race is felt in its absence. It is the thing <em>not</em>spoken about. Race in these articles emerges as significant only insofar as it serves the interests of the white magazine writer to have it do so.\n\nThat the oppositional tendencies to downplay and exoticize race could exist side by side in articles about jazz should come as no surprise, as these impulses continue to characterize our modern discourse. What, after all, is “political correctness” if not a kind of color-blindness? If magazine writers in the 1940s adopted color-blindness because they believed, like so many white Americans, in the inevitability of assimilation, they have remained so today because to discuss racial difference would be to concede that it cannot yet be relegated to history. In spite of the persistence of color-blind discourse, however, the American mass media continues to exoticize the black musician. Just as white Americans in the twenties were captivated by the transgressive black jazz artist who inhabited the exotic world of Harlem speakeasies, white Americans today are transfixed by the black rap artist, evoked in the popular imagination as a streetwise hustler negotiating the urban ghetto. In this tendency towards the simultaneous diminution and amplification of race, the limits of color-blindness as an ideology are laid bare. After almost seven decades of operating within these limits, perhaps it is time for a new generation of Americans to ask whether it will continue to do so.\n<h2> Notes</h2>\n1 The Nadir was first defined by the historian Rayford W.

(430, 8, '2012-02-27 14:59:09', '2012-02-27 14:59:09', 'At the theater camp I used to go to, we cobbled together various scenes from numerous plays, many of which I have forgotten. But I do remember my tiny role in Act III, scene ii of<em> Julius Caesar</em>. Caesar has just been killed and a crowd gathers, clamoring for an explanation. Most people know Marc Antony’s “Friends, Romans, countrymen,” and it is justly celebrated; but Brutus’ speech just before it, in which he describes his reasons for participating in the murder, has just as great an influence on the “throng of citizens,” though they are soon seduced by Antony’s rhetoric. I was one of those citizens, in a makeshift toga and inauthentic sandals, and at every rehearsal I was sincerely swayed by each speech in turn, first by Brutus’ denunciation of the dangers of ambition and then by Marc Antony’s impassioned list of Caesar’s virtues. I cried “Live, Brutus!” in all earnestness. And yet, when the First Citizen said “Methinks there is much reason in his sayings,” referring to Marc Antony’s speech, I was able to nod my head in agreement without a shade of affectation.\n\nMy susceptibility to other people’s rhetoric has not waned in the years since that theatrical venture. Although in theory I know the importance of critical distance, I can never resist falling in love with the bold claims of an unfamiliar ideology or the stylistic arabesques of an undiscovered essayist. This is all very well, and I occasionally flatter myself that I am quick to understand the works I grow fond of, but such an unqualified embrace of another’s ideas is dangerous. I absorb style and content so comprehensively that they become an ineradicable facet of my mental landscape. Once this assimilation has occurred, I can no longer engage in analytical thought without feeling the influence of this or that view, no longer set pen to paper without unconsciously remembering all the writers whose language I have loved. The unnerving part of this endless receptiveness to new ideas lies in my incapacity to distance myself from the authors I have read. They become so intrinsic a part of me that to regard them as foreign feels unhealthy, almost schizophrenic.\n\nMy most visible stylistic influences are transient and easily identifiable. Even when I know that this shaping process is taking place, I am powerless to put it to a halt. When we read Hemingway short stories in my English class last year, I grew increasingly annoyed with what I considered chauvinism in the message of his work. And yet, I could not extend my disapproval to the bright clarity of his prose style. My sentences grew shorter in spite of myself, my descriptions turned terse, and my adverbs came close to extinction. I have overcome this now (perhaps unfortunately), but for a time, I could not resist mimicking Hemingway’s stark prose. The summer I started <em>À la recherche du temps perdu</em>, I succumbed to the opposite impulse. In both French and English, my sentences swelled to paragraph size and became laden with relative clauses, parentheses, commas, and pronouns with ambiguous antecedents. Of course, prose so directly influenced by Proust can never aspire to anything like Proust’s eloquence; it comes off as a pathetic imitation or an ill-starred attempt at parody.\n\nThe narrator of Proust’s epic novel (tentatively named Marcel) also suffers from excessive adoration of other authors. In <em>Du côté de chez Swann</em>, the volume relating the narrator’s childhood, he describes his worship of the writer Bergotte. Here is an approximation of his sentiment, which is much more eloquent in French: “Feeling how many parts of the universe there were that my infirm perception would not distinguish unless [Bergotte] were to bring them closer to me, I would have liked to possess an opinion of his, a metaphor of his, on all things” (my translation; Proust 94). I, too, have felt this particular sort of submissive enthusiasm, or intellectual dependence, so that I am constantly using the theories of a given writer (Proust himself, Simone de Beauvoir, Henry James) as a reference against which to judge the quality of my own thoughts. Marcel goes on: “whenever by chance I happened to encounter, in this or that book of [Bergotte’s], an idea that I had had myself, my heart swelled up as if God in his greatness had given it back to me, declared it legitimate and beautiful” (94). This, then, is the real threat to originality: when only ideas that are echoed by other authors are seen as worthwhile.\n\nStylistic changes are not the most pernicious effects of unconditional love for certain authors. Real trouble begins when methods of thinking as well as ways of writing come under the influence. When I wrote my lens essay at the beginning of this term, for example, I had just read parts of Frantz Fanon’s <em>The Wretched of the Earth</em> and was filled with anti-colonial fervor.1 I was particularly drawn to the section of the book on the divisive effects of cultural imperialism and the difficulty experienced by the Western-educated elite of colonized countries to separate the positive values learned in colonial schools from the shameless Eurocentrism supported there. When looking for an exhibit to examine through the lens of Andre Aciman’s “oasis of the soul,” I could not help but draw links between his oasis and the one I imagined the colonized intellectual to have. Only now do I see the irony in being intellectually dominated by a theory about the dangers of intellectual domination. My admiration for Fanon was so manifest that I was wary about relying too heavily on him in my paper, and this guardedness ultimately prevented my lens essay from being totally derivative. In a defiant footnote on the first page, I demonstrated my awareness of that possibility: “[The “colonized intellectual”] is Frantz Fanon’s phrase from <em>Les damnés de la terre</em>. I am using it here for convenience, not to make a similar political point.” Rereading the paper, I find that this is mostly true. But the specter of Fanon haunts its pages nonetheless.\n\nOur conversation progression dealt with the importance of grammar and usage.2 On this theme we read Orwell’s “Politics and the English Language,” and I fell head over heels for his scathing condemnation of bad writing. The problem, of course, is that essays about style must have a joint influence on someone easily influenced in such matters; for me, this took the form of paralysis. I could hear Orwell whispering to me about the two qualities common to all bad writing: “The first is staleness of imagery; the other is lack of precision. The writer either has a meaning and cannot express it, or he inadvertently says something else” (Orwell 2). I would write a paragraph only to immediately witness the symptoms of the myriad diseases of slovenly writing and abandon it in despair.3 How humiliating, I thought, to write an essay about Orwell that displays all the “worn-out metaphors” (2), “pretentious diction” (3), and “meaningless words” (4) he expressly indicts! Even if the content of my paper displayed worshipful affection for his ideas, it was a bungled attempt at appreciation. Only the necessities of deadlines and impending evaluation saved me from swearing off writing altogether. George Bernard Shaw wrote that if something is worth doing, it is worth doing badly; in the end, I shrugged my shoulders and sat down to write.\n\nI can see these problems now and sigh over them, but I do comfort myself with the thought that being conscious of my tendency to espouse others’ ideas is a step toward developing my own. The writers I love do not people my mind in isolation; they are constantly conversing, finding unexpected common views, or engaging in spirited disagreement. Perhaps this sort of intellectual mishmash is no less productive than the pure, uncontaminated mental climate of genius and originality. And, of course, I am not alone in hearing other voices whenever I lift my pen: if so, indeed, I would be original in my very unoriginality. Perhaps the weight of past influence is necessary to any creative enterprise. Renowned critic Harold Bloom, in his introduction to <em>The Anxiety of Influence</em>, asserts that poetic history “is held to be indistinguishable from poetic influence, since strong poets make that history by misreading one another, so as to clear imaginative space for themselves” (Bloom 5). I am by no means a “strong poet,” and perhaps my very ease in absorbing others’ ideas makes it difficult for me to engage in productive “misreading,” but I share the belief that writing is never a solitary act, that to write even a line entails opening a dialogue with a vast existing body of texts. This is true of everyone, and to attempt to escape from it is both arrogant and futile. The important thing is to see that this endless mingling of ideas from across the centuries is not cause for discouragement or distress. Rather, the chance to converse with the multitude of preceding minds should arouse excited anticipation in every beginning writer.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNotes\n1   In less insidious ways, I am still as enamored of Fanon as ever; reading his book formed my current academic ambition to explore post-colonial studies.\n2   My exhibit for the conversation essay was the ethics of translation. At one point I was going to include a remark in this essay about wondering whether my talents were better suited to translation than to creation, but in translating the few words from Proust above I was reminded that translation is only slightly more derivative than any other form of writing.\n3   “In light of the vast import of translational choices,” I wrote near the end of my essay, “literary translators must be certain to maintain ambiguity rather than erasing it when the original text demands it.” Let alone its grammatical oddness (“maintain” is opposed to “erasing,” and it is unclear how far the “when” clause extends), such a sentence—“in light of the vast import of”!—would merit censure from more lenient critics than Orwell.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWORK CITED\n\nBloom, Harold. <em>The Anxiety of Influence: A Theory of Poetry</em>.

(431, 8, '2012-02-27 14:59:12', '2012-02-27 14:59:12', 'As the first images of an airplane crashing into the World Trade Center were broadcast around the world on the morning of September 11, 2001, the citizens of the United States of America—from Hollywood housewives and Iowa potato farmers to stockbrokers and childcare workers on Wall Street—seemed to be instantaneously pricked and paralyzed by the shattering of glass, the collapsing of iconic towers, the surreal unfamiliarity of vulnerability, and the poison of fear. For the first time in a long time, America was relatively silent. In those first few hours following the attacks, before shock and denial yielded to the desire to assuage acute suffering, a few tangible demonstrations of unadulterated emotional rawness and honesty emerged. One of the first and most poignant of such displays was the fleet of missing person posters plastered across the face of Manhattan. Initially intended to aid in the identification of the missing, they offered an unsullied tribute to the missing people''s unique personalities and distinguishing attributes.\n\nBut in the days and weeks to come, such testaments to the loss of distinctive individuals disappeared from the national landscape. The victims'' stories inundated all faces of mass media, monopolizing mainstream and alternative news networks alike. And yet, despite the victims'' pervasive presence in the media, the actual individuals killed in the terrorist attacks—the names and faces, the unique and transparent personas revealed in the missing person posters—were strangely missing from their own dialogue. What explains this ironic contradiction? What accounts for the September 11th victims being center stage while simultaneously reduced to the spotlight''s shadow?\n\nIn order to understand the mass media''s treatment of the September 11th victims since the attacks, it is necessary to identify what the absence of individual personas from the media''s dialogue—from the evidently newsworthy "victim story"—served to accomplish. Prominent authors Joan Didion and Benedict Anderson offer relevant and invaluable insight. In their books <em>Sentimental Journeys</em> and <em>Imagined Communities: The Origins and Spread of Nationalism</em> respectively, they analyze the media''s role in facilitating certain symbolic ideologies that kindle a sense of social cohesion. In particular, the specific elements of abstraction and idealization, which typify Didion''s "sentimental narrative," exemplified the victims'' media portrayal (255). Furthermore, these elements were a prerequisite for Anderson''s "imagined community of the nation" (22).\n\nThe first phase of the September 11th victims'' characterization began with their transformation into "sentimental narrative," Joan Didion''s term for the generalization of an event into an emotionally drenched and unsuspectingly politicized fable, or maudlin chronicle, which offers its audience a "lesson" or an "encouraging promise of narrative resolution" (260). In describing the qualities and consequences of such narratives, Didion repeatedly draws on the example of the Central Park jogger, a woman who was brutally raped and beaten in New York City''s Central Park in 1989. The jogger was a high-profile crime story and was eventually fashioned into a characterization of the city itself—its problems, solutions, and even its inimitable essence, what made it "so vibrant and so great" (256-58, 260). As a rape victim, the jogger remained nameless in most mainstream press coverage. Though this convention is typically construed as a show of respect for the victim''s privacy, Didion suggests a more utilitarian and self-serving function: the jogger''s anonymity gave the media an unfettered license to marginalize her; to strip her of the idiosyncrasies and varied elements of character, which collectively account for any person''s individuality, in order to turn her story into a more generalizable "sentimental narrative" (260).\n\nAlthough no such convention guaranteed the 9/11 victims'' anonymity, and the individual victims had been publicly named on various occasions, this tendency to "distort and to flatten," to generalize beyond recognition, was indeed the crux of the September 11th narrative (Didion 272). Consequently, it illuminates the motivation for the absence of individuality and distinguishing characteristics from the media''s presentation of the victims. While the sheer number of individuals comprising the overarching category of "victims" rendered the logistics of accurate individual media portrayal to some degree unfeasible, rather than simply acknowledging this predicament, the media chose to capitalize upon the September 11th victims'' intrinsic generalization, and fashion them, just like the jogger, into an iconic caricature.\n\nFor example, "America Weeps" (Figure 1), a heavily distorted photographic reproduction of one of the original 90,000 missing person posters, unequivocally illustrates the media''s characteristic distortion and flattening of the September 11th victims. The original poster has been disrobed of all its distinctive elements: the snapshot, intended as a reference point for identification, has been rendered a painterly emblematic abstraction, leaving the soldier''s face hopelessly unidentifiable; the soldier''s name, written physical description, family contact information, and the original "last seen" statement have been eliminated entirely.\n\n<img src="http://www.columbia.edu/itc/uwp/journal/2009/america_weeps.png" alt="" width="349" height="452" />\nFigure 1.\n\nUpon the blank slate left by the erasure of an individual victim''s identity, the "character" of the September 11th victims as a group could easily be fabricated. Didion notes that, in fashioning such a character into a sentimental narrative, "crimes are universally understood to be news to the extent that they offer, however erroneously, a story, a lesson, a high concept" (255). In light of this, she attributes the jogger''s popularity as a newsworthy story to the situation''s dramatic contrasts—to the attention accorded the comparison of the white, upper-middle class, Ivy League jogger with the low-income, minority, and delinquent qualities attributed to her alleged adolescent attackers. The September 11th victims were similarly portrayed as embodying just such a "superior class" in relation to their attackers, and this superiority provided potent momentum for the sentimental narrative (Didion 271).\n\nThe press coverage surrounding "America Weeps," one of over 400 photographic interpretations of the missing person posters that comprise a traveling exhibit entitled <em>Missing: Last Seen at the World Trade Center on September 11th 2001</em>, clearly illustrates the implied preeminence in the victims'' characterization. <em>The Times-Herald Tribune</em> claimed that the exhibit posters "still denote hope," the<em> Los Angeles Times</em> proffered that they put a "new face on September 11th," while the Oklahoma Gazette noted in one headline that "art evolves from NY tragedy" (Mesoamerica). The exhibit''s sponsor, Mesoamerica, proclaimed that it was, "not a lament for lives lost, as much as a tribute to lives lived. The people in the fliers touched the lives of others. They inspired people who refused to give up hope. They should inspire us to see the affect we have on those whose lives we touch everyday" (Mesoamerica). Though Mesoamerica also claimed that the exhibit''s purpose was to make September 11th "real" for areas of the country geographically isolated from the intimate pain of New York and to "honor" the lives lost, in reality "America Weeps" and the <em>Missing</em> exhibit as a whole did precisely the opposite, both reflecting and promulgating the victims'' abstraction.\n\nIn fact, all such wildly unspecific and hypothetical commentary evidences that the victims'' idealized abstraction connoted "not the actual victim of an actual crime but a fictional character of a slightly earlier period" (Didion 272). The victims were depicted not as average people, but as the best of America—heroes, models of success, philanthropists, leaders, intellectuals, and inspirational icons. They were the epitome of diversity, the supposed realization of the American dream. Furthermore, the victims were not the only subjects of this exaggerated glorification. As the sentimental narrative gained momentum, the citizens of New York City as a whole were similarly characterized, modeled into a Pleasantville-like community. Demonstrations of goodwill and neighborly love—of a quaint camaraderie stemming directly from the common bond of having survived tragedy and sharing immediate suffering—were broadcast internationally. Almost immediately, a "pernicious nostalgia" (Didion 272), or longing for a stronger sense of community, for a sense of common purpose sprang forth across the country.\n\nBenedict Anderson provides another way of thinking about the generalization and abstraction of the characters in this sentimental narrative, and the nostalgic longing for community that the narrative evoked. At the point when they became abstract objects of "pernicious nostalgia," the September 11th victims became the "solitary hero" of Anderson''s "imagined community of the nation"—that undeniable sense of unity, brotherhood, and nationalistic pride that so often characterizes the citizens of countries across the globe (32, 22). Anderson''s description of the nation as "imagined" reflects the fact that no single member of the community will ever know "more than a handful" of the individuals comprising it, yet "in the minds of each lives the image of their communion" (6, 26).\n\nThe introduction of the "pronominal adjective" to the 9/11 narrative—repeated references to "our grief" and "America''s loss"—confirms that the September 11th sentimental narrative irrevocably crossed into the territory of the imagined community (32). Even the title of the photograph "America Weeps" plainly demonstrates this collective generalization of grief, this assumption of "simultaneous" or omnipresent suffering, pain, and loss amongst <em>all</em> citizens of the United States (Anderson 24). Given that the photographer, Bronston Jones, does not offer any indication that the soldier was a real person with a real family, "America Weeps" seems to imply that the soldier does not "belong" to anyone specifically. Rather, the title and the poster''s distortion, showing the soldier''s face literally melting into and becoming synonymous with the American flag, suggest that the soldier belongs to the United States of America.\n\nAs such, the image is "saturated with ghostly <em>national</em> imaginings" (Anderson 9). Indeed, the exhibit''s website even compares "America Weeps" to Arlington''s "Tomb of the Unknown Soldier," and the photographer remarks that, "The man in the flier has come to represent all <em>we</em> lost" (Mesoamerica). This statement is even more telling when considered in light of Bronston Jones'' safe emotional and geographic distance from the tragedy: he was at home in California on the morning of September 11, 2001. There is no indication that he was personally acquainted with any of the victims murdered in the terrorist attacks. And yet, he says "all we lost" (Mesoamerica). Like Anderson''s example of the Filipino nationalist author José Rizal, Bronston Jones, though not having "the faintest idea" of the "individual identities" of those involved in his artistic and nationalistic production (in Jone''s case, the victims and all U.S. citizens) nevertheless participates in a dialogue that is marked by an "ironical intimacy, as though their relationships with each other are not in the smallest degree problematic" (28).\n\nThis generalization of grief, which was made possible by the sentimental narrative''s initial abstraction of the victims, is inseparable from the corresponding revival of the imagined community of the nation. From the concept''s introduction, Benedict Anderson links the imagined community to a corresponding dialogue of fatality, to the inevitable loss and taking of life that has paralleled the rise of the modern nation. He states that this nationalistic bond, this "deep horizontal comradeship" is precisely what allowed "for so many millions of people, not so much to kill" as to be willing to sacrifice their own lives "for such limited imaginings" (7). In other words, Anderson attributes the human bloodshed of the last two centuries, the "colossal sacrifices" incurred by individuals and nations alike, to the largely sentimental notion of "fraternity" or, alternatively, to the nation itself (7).\n\nIn addition, Anderson points out that the decreasing significance of religion in society, and hence the decreasing significance afforded doctrines that emphasize belief in the continuation of life beyond physical death, created the need for a replacement belief system. Anderson comments that, "Disintegration of paradise: nothing makes fatality more arbitrary. Absurdity of salvation: nothing makes another style of continuity more necessary" (11). The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, were the deadliest attacks on the United States in the country''s history. Taking this into account, the reawakening of the imagined community of the nation immediately following the attacks begins to make sense. The sentimental narrative of the attacks, which eventually became synonymous with the imagined community of the nation, allowed the victims to be eternalized and provided this other "style of continuity" necessary to ameliorate the country''s collective, real or imagined, grief.\n\nLooking back on the media''s treatment of the September 11th victims reveals that their initial abstraction and idealization, courtesy of the sentimental narrative, fostered an emotionally seeded, deeply felt, and rigidly defended sense of nationalism—one that utilized its inherent "magic" to "turn chance into destiny," to make the lives lost in the attacks meaningful. The victims were no longer "arbitrarily juxtaposed" amongst one another and their simultaneous deaths were not mere coincidence—they were Americans, the "symbolic body and blood" of America, and they died for "our great country" (Didion 270). And, in the end, no greater source of Anderson''s "imagined linkage" exists than the imagined community of the nation, the twentieth and twenty-first century''s most elaborate, resilient, and compelling sentimental narrative.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Works Cited</strong>\n\nAnderson, Benedict. <em>Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism.</em> Rev. ed.

(433, 8, '2012-02-27 15:03:53', '2012-02-27 15:03:53', 'One of the most popular practices amongst students at my high school was insulting Iowans. As denizens of a large, diverse suburb of Boston, we looked upon the hinterland residents as the antithesis of what we thought ourselves to be: cosmopolitan individuals who had seen people from all ends of the earth – and, for that matter, had seen a traffic light. Like my peers, I felt acquainted with diversity: I had traveled, had best friends of different races, and had, at one time, been one of only two Caucasian girls in my class. After a decade in a school system renowned for being a Noah’s Ark of ethnicities, I could recite plenty of facts about the beliefs, customs, and general idiosyncrasies of many parts of the world. Thanks to a curriculum with extensive units on civil rights and the Holocaust, I had had the dangers of exclusion and ethnocentrism hammered into me. I was wary of judging other cultures, determined to be open-minded, and desperate to avoid provincialism.\n\nYet something was awry. I couldn’t understand why a Chinese friend didn’t dare disobey her parents when they insisted she attend math camp, although it was clear the humanities were her forte. I was clueless as to why a boy in my biology class insisted on returning home to Israel over spring break, despite the disastrous bombings that were occurring almost daily. When my favorite history teacher spent a sabbatical year in Africa, I was resentful that I couldn’t be in his class, but also confused: he had already spent a number of years in Africa and I didn’t see why he needed to go back. Cosmopolitan, to me, meant Carrie Bradshaw’s cocktail of choice, not understanding, or knowledge, of the ways of the world.\n\nEvidently, despite all efforts, cross-cultural education at my school left many things to be desired. I wasn’t the only student who had trouble shedding divisions of nation and culture in order to relate to all people on a basic human level. How could my high school have done a better job of turning my peers and me into people with a true understanding and respect for humankind? How could it have created young adults, who, as Martha Nussbaum puts it, are “citizens of the world?” In her article of the same title, Nussbaum tries to provide the answers to this question. She discusses the necessity and value of being of being citizen of the world and how an effective cross-cultural education can help achieve this aim.\n\n“Citizens of the World” is a piece that stresses the commonality of all people. All people, writes Nussbaum, are defined not exclusively by our “national origin and group memberships” but as humans (52). In Nussbaum’s opinion, America’s educational system does not effectively teach this concept. This failure is especially injurious on the university level. While universities are designed to prepare students to be active participants in modern society, graduates still often lack the necessary tools needed to function as a world citizen. Globalization, and the consequential shrinking of the world, has made cross-cultural comfort one of the most important skills required of today’s young professionals. It is the function of multicultural education to prepare people for these new challenges that, while by definition modern, can be understood by looking toward the past.\n\nOne of Nussbaum’s techniques is to trace cross-cultural education through history, drawing upon the ideas of great thinkers and leaders. These ideas are far from outdated, but rather provide invaluable insight as to how cosmopolitanism can work today. Nussbaum focuses her discussion on ideas of world citizenship fostered by the ancient Greeks and Romans. Using these concepts as a “lens” with which to view my own cross-cultural education sheds light on some mistakes my high school made, and suggests how the school could have better achieved the goal of “[educating] people [so they] can operate as world citizens with sensitivity and understanding” (52).\n\nNussbaum writes about Diogenes the Cynic in order to address ideas about standard conventions and the dark underbelly of such powerful norms: prejudices toward the unconventional. One of the main goals of multicultural education at my school was to reduce prejudice; the curriculum reinforced the idea that “different isn’t necessarily wrong.” However, students never questioned what determined their concepts of right and wrong in the first place.\n\nThis need to examine the “conventional origins of judgments” (57) was missing from the curriculum. For one class, we read Maxine Hong Kingston’s <em>The Woman Warrior</em>, her coming-of-age tale as Chinese girl in America. This memoir closely examines the discrepancies between Chinese values and beliefs and American ones. Some of the ideas expressed by Kingston’s family, particularly her ultra-traditional mother, seemed irrational or unreasonable from an “American” perspective, such as strong ideas about ghosts or prominent ideas about female inferiority.\n\nDespite our urge to scoff at these ideas—believing in ghosts? obviously the woman wasn’t rational—my classmates and I accepted them. Our acceptance, however, stemmed more from a desire not to be seen as xenophobic or ethnocentric than from a true understanding of traditional Chinese logic. Students never detached themselves from their own beliefs in order to examine the origins of those beliefs, an exercise which would have provided valuable insights into both their own culture and the ones they were studying. According to Diogenes, the failure to take a step back from our own beliefs before studying the beliefs of others impairs cross-cultural understanding.\n\nDiogenes believed that to truly be a citizen of the world, we must “become, to a certain extent, philosophical exiles from our own way of life, seeing them from the vantage point of the outsider and asking the questions an outsider is likely to ask about their meaning and function” (58). Socrates echoed this idea by fervently espousing the examined life. Had students been encouraged to challenge the validity of their own beliefs, they might have viewed the practices of other societies as not just acceptable, but perhaps sometimes preferable, with their own merits and gifts.\n\nDiogenes also believed that one could evaluate a society’s institutions and practices in a non-biased fashion, by basing one’s judgment on the general idea of what is good for human beings. Nussbaum expands upon this point by discussing the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius. Marcus Aurelius said: “world citizenship does not, and should not, require that we suspend criticism toward other individuals and cultures” (65). Basic ideas of what is good or bad, right or wrong, stretch beyond biases and traditional culture-based beliefs to universal concepts of morality, as well as plain common sense.\n\nMy school, however, equated any sort of judgment on another society with prejudice and provincialism. Criticism of other cultures was discouraged. For example, in my Sophomore English class, we read Chinua Achebe’s <em>Things Fall Apart</em>, a seminal novel set in an African community called the Igbo. The class spent plenty of time discussing the cultural differences between the Igbo culture and our own society, such as the varied religious rituals or the distinctions in family life. But Things Fall Apart is also replete with intense violence that, while still found in our society, is not condoned as it is in Igbo culture. Atrocities in the book, such as spousal abuse or fratricide, were always chalked up to the individual; blame was never placed on the society itself.\n\nThe result of this was that when students encountered an action or institution that seemed unjust or unreasonable, they invalidated their own morals by attributing their concept of “wrong” to the society in which they had been raised. Our basic morals, which we derive from our humanness and not from our culture, were devalued as time and time again it was emphasized that values and ideas come from nurture, not nature. Marcus Aurelius would have reminded my teachers, classmates, and I that “the world citizen can be very critical of unjust actions or policies, and of the character of the people who promote them” (65). To know that adjudication is possible without necessarily being racist or prejudiced would have put students more at ease in their multicultural studies, enabling them to take in information, but also to truly process and analyze it.\n\nMuch of the criticism that the students felt was impermissible to turn on other cultures was turned back on America.. In my junior year American literature class, most students felt free to attack our own country and history to no end; we read<em>The Scarlet Letter</em> and tore apart Puritan society. We read <em>The Glass Menagerie</em>and mercilessly mocked the culture of the South. I was shocked when I learned that some schools recited the Pledge of Allegiance each morning; I did not even know the Pledge of Allegiance. Many students felt that supporting something American meant rejecting something global, which was precisely what we had been taught not to do. At the risk of making the same platitudinous statement that countless others have applied to the experience of 9/11, that day and the events that unfolded afterwards forced us to rethink what it meant to be American.\n\nStudents like myself, who believed national identity to be inherently prejudiced and dangerous, were compelled to change from people with a global, albeit flawed, identity to “Americans.” Yet due to our nebulous national identities, this transformation would take us along a rocky path. The Stoics understood the importance of national, ethnic, and/or religious identity, and, more importantly, knew that it was not mutually exclusive with a global one. My schoolmates, on the other hand, did not always seem to know this. This was demonstrated by the panic in our school system caused by the fact that, despite all efforts, students always self-segregated by race or ethnicity. The administration’s efforts to get all the students to mingle with each other failed miserably: the cafeteria remained a collection of territories, with the Black kids reigning over the space near the door and the Russians entrenched in the back. Very little value was placed on the benefits of spending time with, or being close to, people who shared one’s identity. We often felt that patriotism was unimportant, and that connecting with members of our own religious, ethnic, or racial groups was somehow shameful. Att the end of the day, despite the guilt one might have felt over only connecting with students of other cultures in the classroom or on the playing field, it was always the kids with whom you attended confirmation class, or the ones whose first language was the same as yours, who became your closest friends.\n\nThe Stoics would argue that “love for what is near (is) a fundamental human trait, and a highly rational way to comport oneself as a citizen” (61). I understood this every time I participated in a youth event at my synagogue, which often filled me with a warm sense of inclusion and belonging. My Jewish identity, however, was a trait I subconsciously kept hidden in public school. I feared anything that might separate me from the homogeneous masses, anything that might be seen as a liability in my quest to remain as neutral as Switzerland. And I was among the lucky ones: students who didn’t participate in such institutions as Hebrew School got far less opportunity to truly fit in than I. When these opportunities arose I felt both a member of something inclusive and a part of a larger whole, a point at the center of concentric circles.\n\nEvery year around Martin Luther King Day, members from a local church would come to Friday night services at my synagogue, and afterwards, the gospel choir gave a performance that year after year awed the entire congregation. As I sat there listening to the beautiful voices, I was still aware of the divisions in the room: black and white, Jewish and Christian. But the differences seemed miniscule compared to the overarching feeling of commonality: not only were we all humans, but both groups had faced prejudice and persecution, and continued to fight these forces. This was the kind of identity-centered experience that made me more open to others, but that I always had to look outside my school to find.\n\nEvaluating my educational experience by looking at historical ideas provides clues to how my school could have more effectively created “citizens of the world.” However, it is a difficult and complex process for one to translate the ideas of Diogenes, Marcus Aurelius, Socrates, or the Stoics into a multicultural curriculum. Studying these thinkers won’t inform a school administrator as to how to spread cross-cultural studies across a variety of academic subjects, or how to ensure that the school’s faculty has expertise in the material. Martha Nussbaum knows this, and in her effort to champion her own ideas of the ideal educational program, she thus looks beyond history to contemporary educational institutions that, in her opinion, have the right idea.\n\nNussbaum, for example, examines St. Lawrence University and SUNY Buffalo in order to crystallize her ideas about how cross-cultural education can be implemented, taking into consideration pragmatic roadblocks. The use of this additional lens succeeds in transforming her ideas from purely theoretical ones to those which are more practical. Yet the recommendations that Nussbaum makes based on the examples of colleges like St. Lawrence are still unrealistically ideal. For example, not all schools can afford to have their faculty move temporarily to India or Kenya in order to be able to impart firsthand knowledge to their students, as St. Lawrence did (80). By examining her topic from this practical perspective as well as a theoretical one, Nussbaum shows that no matter how much a study of history might validate pursuit of cross-cultural education at all costs, sometimes the concrete costs of multicultural immersion are more than every educational institution can afford. But even if they can’t send teachers to do fieldwork Africa or Asia, schools can take smaller-scale measures to make sure that their educators exemplify the citizen of the world perspective that they seek to impart to students.\n\nThe ultimate goal of cross-cultural education is not simply to impart knowledge of other cultures, nor is it to abolish stereotypes, nor is it even to have students empathize with all humans. Adequate achievement of these aims can still leave us with people who accept and understand cosmopolitanism, but who do not see its value. As Nussbaum says,\n<blockquote>It is up to us as educators, to show our students the beauty and interest of a life that is open to the whole world, to show them that there is after all more joy in the kind of citizenship that questions than in the kind that simply applauds, more fascination in the study of human beings in all their real variety and complexity than in the zealous pursuit of superficial stereotypes..... (84).</blockquote>\nNussbaum believes that the objective of cross-cultural education isn’t just to help the hypothetical (NB: aspiring? future? putative?) young professional with an international career, but to excite her, to spark her interest, to help her achieve a life she loves. With the ancient Greek and Roman ideas of world citizenship, a few contemporary examples of cross-cultural education done well, and Nussbaum’s prescription for joy mixed in, schools like the one I attended can truly teach their students to be citizens of the world. Graduates will know not only about the dangers of judging Muslims or Germans, but perhaps also Iowans.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWorks Cited:\n\nNussbaum, Martha C. <em>Cultivating Humanity: A Classic Defense of Reform in Liberal Education. </em>Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1997. 50-84.\n\n&nbsp;', 'The Shortcomings of Good Intentions', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '300-autosave', '', '', '2012-02-27 15:03:53', '2012-02-27 15:03:53', '', 300, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?p=433', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
(435, 8, '2012-02-27 15:07:04', '2012-02-27 15:07:04', 'The Winchester shirt, with its distinctive white collar and French cuffs, was designed in the 19th century as a sporting shirt by hunter Oliver Fisher Winchester. Since then, the shirt has undergone a Banana Republic-like transformation. What was once meant to serve the rugged outdoorsman in the wilderness now serves the refined businessman in the office. Through its changing functions, the shirt has taken on new cultural meaning, becoming what French philosopher of semiotics Roland Barthes would call a "classifying myth," symbolizing membership in high society. Analyzing the mythology of the Winchester shirt in Barthes'' terms can shed light on the shirt''s cultural significance, as well as demonstrate the possibilities and limitations of Barthes'' conception of myth.\n\nIn his collection of essays, <em>Mythologies</em>, Barthes uses linguistic theory to analyze non-linguistic entities in terms of "signifier" and "signified." His "myth" is the synthesis of the signified with the entity''s unique signification process. Myth informs culture as a sort of autonomous constituent. It is commutative: culture and signification beget myth, and myth begets culture and signification. Myth is elemental to the reality of its own subject. That is, an entity does not exist in a vacuum; it is necessarily informed by the meanings society attaches to it, both consciously and unconsciously. Myths are not qualified by truth; they are living, self-perpetuating phenomena that lend themselves well to social theorizing.\n\nCertainly, the Barthesian myth is inexorably linked with its own sociological consequences. Barthes examines his subjects through a Marxist dialectic. His paradigm is illustrated in "Soap-powders and Detergents," in which he writes: "this distinction [between the respective imageries of liquid versus powder soaps] has ethnographic correlatives" (<em>Mythologies</em> 36). Although ethnography usually concerns nations and races, Barthes extends the term to include classes. While establishing a seemingly fantastic signification framework that places in opposition a generalized "washer woman" and "housewife," Barthes derives implicit class distinctions from the variation between advertisements for soap powders and for liquid detergents. Ultimately, this unexpected examination of class struggle based on variations in detergent advertising highlights the relationship between myth social stratification.\n\nMyths have agency to unite, divide, and exclude, sometimes simultaneously. Myths develop in stages marked by the confluence of two forces: the impregnation of a signifier with its signified and the cultural regeneration of this signification. Myth is perpetuated across generations through translation and sometimes transmutation. This process can be unconscious, conscious, or both. In all of these three cases, the moment that one culture or subculture (read: class) takes ownership of the myth, its course of regeneration is altered. Following this appropriation, the myth becomes universal within and exclusive to that constituency. Wine, for instance, is hardly unique to France. However, when the French identified wine as particularly French, wine''s myth developed accordingly. In Barthes''s words, wine provides a "collective morality" for the French (<em>Mythologies</em> 59). The issue of morality is specific to the function of wine in France. However, that the morality is collective indicates that the wine-myth is what may be called a <em>classifying myth</em>, whose primary signification unifies a certain group of people as the signifier''s constituents and, in so doing, sets them apart from and excludes everyone else.\n\nThe Winchester shirt also functions as a classifying myth. Through the process of regeneration, the shirt became an indirect suggestion of membership in high society. The signifier is primarily concerned not with monetary capital but with a kind of cultural capital, namely <em>knowingness</em>, the possession of class-specific knowledge and disposition. Knowingness is the signification buffer between high society and the Winchester shirt. The shirt signifies knowingness, which in turn signifies membership in high society. Members of this high society themselves are<em>agents of the myth</em>, meaning they are primary actors in its "life." The refusal of high society, of these agents, to codify knowingness perpetuates the very exclusivity on which it feeds. In this way, the shirt sustains its own classifying myth.\n\nThe Winchester shirt has acquired its myth through two stages of signification, in its transformation from clothing for the outdoorsman to clothing for the businessman. The shirt''s white frame now emphasizes form over function, and as a result, it can be designated a "sign-function" (Barthes, <em>Semiology</em> 41). It is now a mess of competing signs. The pallor of its edges suggests purity, in a throwback to the days of the hunter-gatherer, or at least to the days when hunting and gathering were common recreational activities in high society. While that association seems to contradict the image of the wealthy as leisurely and unemployed, it in fact enhances it because that image is itself reminiscent of the time when men "worked" in the style of Newland Archer, esquire, and never rolled up their sleeves (which would be antithetical to the Winchester style anyway). The shirt, therefore, is an affirmation of both hierarchy and the related manly ambition for predominance in the wild or workplace.\n\nThus the Winchester shirt sign-function came into being. The style was marked by the suggestions of wealth that accompany leisure-hunting, and, as a result, wearing a Winchester shirt came to denote membership in high society. Ultimately, while the original hunting function receded, the sign endured, and society "re-functionalized" it as if it were made for use by the business elite (Barthes,<em>Semiology </em>42). Having completed this cycle of normative and cultural regeneration, the Winchester appears "just" a shirt for the same reasons that "a fur-coat [can] be described as if it served only to protect from the cold" (Barthes, <em>Semiology</em> 42). What the shirt was has been subsumed by what it now is, namely an indirect signifier for knowingness.\n\nKnowingness is the unspoken but undeniable key to the kingdom of high society. According to Barthes, "knowing <em>how</em> to drink [wine] … [qualifies] the Frenchman, demonstrating at once his performance, his control and his sociability" (<em>Mythologies</em> 59). Indeed, it seems that knowingness substantiates the classifying myth. Barthes asserts that to be French is to possess both the knowledge of proper drinking technique and a disposition marked by specific attributes. This knowingness cloisters the French, unifying them in their brand of isolation. Knowing how to dress is to an American businessman what knowing how to drink is to a Frenchman. The right combination of suit, shirt, tie, and shoes is important not because it demonstrates style, but because it betrays a familiarity with the principles of men''s business attire and a disposition confident enough to enable one''s conformity to unspoken expectations; in other words, the right combination demonstrates knowingness.\n\nThe man who understands that a cutaway collar belongs with a full knot like the Windsor is likely also to understand how to behave at a business lunch because these comprehensions are both hallmarks of hereditary knowingness. A cummerbund may be worn however one likes, but it is meant to accompany formal dinner attire. Similarly, a Winchester shirt may be worn however one likes, but it is meant to accompany knowingness. This dependency is so strong that wearing a Winchester shirt while lacking knowingness will likely expand the gap between the wearer and high society. Donning a Charles Tyrwhitt Winchester shirt, of course, reveals a particular sense of style, but more importantly, it highlights the wearer''s familiarity with those standards of behavior commensurate with elite businessmen. It is thus evident that in the Winchester''s myth, knowingness is the signified. However, within the framework of this classification myth is a subtler signifier, the white collar itself.\n\nIn a shift to the sub-myth of the white collar, although the signifier changes, the signified stays the same. Fundamentally, the white collar''s classifying myth is realized in its physical differentiation of two groups. It has been saturated with socio-political implications at least since 1919, when Upton Sinclair remarked on the capitalist connotations of a white collar in his exposé, <em>Brass Check</em>. While the Winchester''s signification developed separately from the white versus blue collar paradigm, it is nonetheless affected by that sub-myth. The collar carries important social meaning, ultimately signifying a romanticized bourgeoisie-proletariat class struggle. The reality of such a struggle is irrelevant because it was mythologized regardless. As a result of this signification, the structure of the Winchester classification myth is binary, implying both that the wearer is opposed to the average working man and that he is a member of high society.\n\nThis definition of high society within a larger signification framework is maintained cyclically. The binary signification, particularly the implication of knowingness, is used by high society to sustain the very exclusivity that defines it in the first place. Because knowingness paradigmatically reveals behavioral standards, it self-perpetuates its exclusivity. High society inherits and passes down knowingness through generations; the origin of knowingness is neither identifiable nor important. Knowingness is not an explicit body of knowledge that a newcomer can memorize and acquire. Furthermore, any explicable knowingness is deliberately obfuscated by the agents of the myth. The rest is perpetuated through unconscious, cultural regeneration. Knowingness is divided so statically along class lines because one cannot become part of high society without it, yet one is unlikely to have it unless a member of high society. Thus, Barthes''s Marxist dialectic appears vindicated in the catch-22 that sustains classification myths like the Winchester''s. Deliberate attempts to codify knowingness would derail the myth''s process of unconscious cultural regeneration and retard its process of conscious, normative regeneration. Such attempts, if successful, could result in a microcosmic overthrow of bourgeois cultural capitalism.\n\nAlthough the derivation of such class distinction from a shirt is perhaps unsettling, it is not surprising. Fashion breeds mythology, especially classification myths. Specifically, items like the Winchester are significant because they represent the perpetual attempts by cloistered communities to grasp the vestiges of intra-class nepotism, in this case conveniently disguised as fashion, while appearing politically correct. As with any consciously rendered explanation of a mythology, this one is imperfect. Generally, Barthes''s mythological paradigm is incomplete because it neither accounts sufficiently for consciously perpetuated myths nor provides a way to distinguish them from comparably organic ones. It is, therefore, an inadequate framework for analyzing the Winchester myth, which is consciously perpetuated by its constituents and unconsciously perpetuated by society at large through stereotypes about wealth and notions of class distinction. Such a complex network of regenerative sources for one myth exceeds the limitations of Barthes''s concept. That said, the application of linguistic theory to non-linguistic entities astutely acknowledges the centrality of language to both conscious and unconscious societal dialogues. The way that individuals speak about the wealthy or the upper class relates directly to the way that society thinks about them. Of course, when the implications of something like the Winchester shirt are consciously considered, whether in a Barthesian or other framework, the objectivity and universality of the myth are compromised. Myth is an inherently unacknowledged life form, and though studying mythology is valid, it is also destructive.\n\n&nbsp;', 'Wearing What You Know', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '208-autosave', '', '', '2012-02-27 15:07:04', '2012-02-27 15:07:04', '', 208, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?p=435', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

(436, 8, '2012-02-27 15:09:53', '2012-02-27 15:09:53', 'Based on reviews and articles I had read about the new faux documentary <em>Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan</em>, I expected that when I actually saw it, I would be disgusted. I imagined sitting low in my theatre seat, covering my eyes, horrified by the displays on the screen. When I finally got to see the movie, I was disappointed at my lack of disgust and horror. It was not nearly as outrageous or offensive as I felt all those articles had promised it would be. My disappointment made me think about my extensive exposure to vulgar comedy and the nature of comedy in America. Perhaps I have been desensitized to bodily functions and nudity, especially when they are presented in the name of comedy. Perhaps years filled with<em> American Pie</em>’s and <em>Scary Movie’s</em>, capped by the summer of raunchy sex farces (like <em>Wedding Crashers</em> and <em>The 40-Year-Old Virgin</em>) have made it hard for me to be shocked and appalled by anything, even the scene of a hairy naked man wrestling a fat naked man, which constitutes the climax of the Borat movie.\n\nFor those who have not seen the movie (or read every article written about it) the idea is as follows: a journalist from Kazakhstan named Borat drives an ice cream truck across America, hoping to meet the woman of his dreams, Pamela Anderson. Because Borat is new to America and knows nothing of American decorum or tradition, he unwittingly does and says things to the locals along his path that both infuriate them and end up making them look like horrible people. Take for example the man working at a rodeo who, trusting the seemingly simple foreigner, tells Borat that America is currently working on making it acceptable to “string up” homosexuals. The concept of lulling unsuspecting locals into a false sense of confidence so that they will reveal their innermost prejudices may sound cruel and potentially humiliating for all involved, but the movie has been very well received in America, debuting at number one and managing to keep the top spot for the following week as well. It is difficult to find an unfavorable review of the film, and the “comic elite” in America is calling creator and star Sacha Baron Cohen a “revolutionary” (Stein, Rottenberg). Still, despite the positive reception from critics, Borat has caused worldwide controversy as well, which made me wonder: what is it exactly that separates those who hate the movie from those who love it? Is it just that people who hate it don’t “get it”?\n\nCohen, due to his performance as Borat, has been compared to Andy Kaufman, called a “Johnny Knoxville with a sense of humor,” and a Dadaist (Stein, Rottenberg). His performance blurs the line between the “wildly surreal and the all-too-real” as he allows his subjects no “comforting recourse to ironic detachment” (Rottenberg). It is reported that during filming, Cohen was extremely dedicated to the project, refusing to break character between the time he woke up and the time he went to bed. The mustache is real, the suit remained unwashed to make him smell more “foreign,” and all promotional interviews were conducted with Cohen in character (Rottenberg). This kind of ultra-real comedy, in which unwitting targets do not realize they are part of the joke, is, according to those in the know, a trend emerging with the release of <em>Borat</em>. Referred to as “street comedy,” it relies on extreme absurdity, well-placed realism (such as the authentically smelly suit), and little-to-no money (Stein). It is a descendent of <em>Jackass</em> and Stephen Colbert, but without the “twinkle in [the] eye” (Rottenberg). The look of <em>Borat</em>—the grainy, cheaply shot footage—is intentional, as is the fact that Borat hails from a real country. As British comedian David Baddiel points out, “if it had been an older comedian, Borat would have been from Stupidlandia” (Stein).\n\nIt is in the spirit of this new brand of guerrilla comedy that the faux documentary becomes so successful as a genre. <em>Borat</em> simply would not work as either a social commentary or a shock-filled comedy if a viewer felt that everyone on screen was in on the joke. The genuine reactions to Borat deliver most of the laughs, and it is knowing that these people are revealing their true selves, their innermost thoughts and beliefs, that allows the film to comment on American society and culture.\n\nWhen considering some of the most famously disgusting comedic outlets, such as<em>South Park, Team America: World Police</em>, and even <em>Mad</em> and <em>Cracked </em>magazines, it seems obvious that even if the public is sure to be disgusted, comedy just has to go as far as it can go. Comedians revel in the challenge to make audiences cringe. It is with this in mind that one considers how a group of the most respected comedians in America, following an advance viewing of Borat, shared a “sense of collective astonishment” (Rottenberg). In a group that included a <em>Simpsons</em> writer, Garry Shandling, and one of the creators of <em>Seinfeld</em> (the other, Larry Charles, actually directed <em>Borat</em>), there seemed to be a consensus that what they saw was “something totally original,” and that Cohen had changed comedy in the same way that Marlon Brando changed dramatic acting after <em>On the Waterfront</em> (Rottenberg, Stein).\n\nThis new style of aggressive comedy is expected to horrify older viewers, namely those over the age of 35. Says journalist Joel Stein, “If you’re over 35, you think you have the right to keep your regrettable moments private. If you’re under 35, you realize that everything is public now.” As one woman in the film tells Borat, when he asks her to clean him after using the toilet, “That is a very private thing.” But it isn’t anymore; nothing is. And the younger generations are used to that. In the era of reality television and Internet video stars, everyone’s idiocy and/or talent is on display for all to see. The notion of privacy as an assured right no longer exists, and everyone, at every moment, is at risk of revealing his or her true nature. The arrival and popularity of Colbert, YouTube and <em>Jackass</em> means the medium will continue to grow. No one is safe. At the Toronto Film Festival in September 2006, <em>Borat</em> “earned a rapturous reception,” even though the projector malfunctioned midway through the movie and despite the festival’s renown for debuting future Oscar contenders, which <em>Borat</em>reportedly outshone (Rottenberg). The movie has also created a lot of buzz on college campuses, as well as within the film industry. So it may be safe to assume that this type of movie, a colorful mix of vulgarity and supposed social commentary, is inevitably going to be more fervently anticipated, and finally received, by those Americans who are presumably more liberal, more open-minded, and more creative. Or is it just that this was the right time for this movie to be seen in America?\n\nProfessor Paul Lewis suggests in his critique of the film that the latter may be the case, and the movie’s reception internationally suggests it may be an entirely cultural issue. Borat has definitely not been so welcome in Russia, or in his supposed homeland of Kazakhstan. The former has not banned the movie, as was reported, but its Federal Culture and Cinematography Agency, which is responsible for certifying films for distribution, has refused to certify <em>Borat</em> (Myers). The agency contends that its decision was based on “potential to offend religious and ethnic feelings,” although due to rampant illegal DVD production in Russia the film will likely still be seen (Myers). This implies that there may still be some demand for the movie despite belief by officials that it will offend many within the country, particularly Russia’s large Muslim population.\n\n<em>Borat</em> is the first movie that has been refused certification for distribution in Russia since the collapse of Soviet censorship in the 1980’s (Myers). Even Kazakhstan has not explicitly refused distribution of the movie. This leads one to wonder whether Russia’s choice to refuse distribution for Borat is based on cultural, ethical, and religious reasons, or something else entirely. Daniil B. Dondurei, editor of <em>The Russian Art of Cinema</em> magazine, argues that the decision was motivated by politics. He cites “ethnic tensions, but also close relations between Russian and Kazakhstan, and a taboo in Russia against satirical depictions of national leaders or political systems”—a notable cultural difference from America, where leaders and politics are not only satirized publicly but frequently, on two intensely popular shows,<em> The Daily Show</em> and <em>The Colbert Report</em> (Myers).\n\nIn Kazakhstan, where they were likely expecting a “major, if probably hysterical, hit to [their] image,” the government went on the defensive in the wake of the release of<em>Borat</em>, taking out a four-page tourism advertisement in the <em>New York Times</em> and the<em>International Herald Tribune</em>, and producing television ads for distribution in America (EP Staff). The print ad, described by journalist Josh Rottenberg as “unintentionally funny,” tries to appeal to potential visitors with such tidbits as, “The country is home to the world’s largest population of wolves” (Rottenberg). Initially, the government of Kazakhstan threatened legal action against Cohen but has now invited him to visit. Cohen is considering going to Kazakhstan (in character, of course), and sees it as the “ultimate opportunity to conflate his made-up character with reality” (Stein).\n\nSo, Russia does not find Borat funny; Kazakhstan does not find Borat funny (although they are beginning to adopt the adage “If you can’t beat ’em…”); and Jordan, Kuwait, Barhain, Oman, and Qatar, all of which have “barred distribution of the film” due to predominantly Muslim populations, do not find Borat funny (Myers). Then why does America seem to find him so funny?\n\nThe answer to this question appears to lie in an interesting cultural conglomeration: Borat, both the movie and the man, embodies everything that Americans find humorous. He is a combination of highbrow satire, lowbrow sight gags, extreme and inaccurate caricature—he creates in the average viewer, through his own inadequacies, a quiet feeling of superiority. This recipe has proven successful in so many of America’s most popular comedic outlets: The Simpsons most notably; network sitcoms like the 1980s hit <em>Perfect Strange</em>, which capitalized on the inherent humor of a foreigner trying to start a life in America; even <em>The Daily Show</em>, which earned its extreme popularity by emphasizing for a delighted audience the constant foibles of politicians and other public figures.\n\nAmerica, it seems, has a history of humor based on “patronization of the other,” satire based upon stereotypes beginning with the caricature of Yankee Doodle during the American Revolution (Stein). Yankee Doodle was depicted as a country “bumpkin,” the opposite of the perception of the British as fancy and sophisticated, and was originally created as an “ignorant clodhopper [to] appeal to the British soldiery as an apt caricature of the rustic rebels” (Songs and Oaths, Tandy). Eventually, the character of Yankee Doodle was proudly adopted by American soldiers to emphasize and proclaim their difference and independence from the British (Songs and Oaths). These exaggerated characters generally develop into recognized facsimiles of a given ethnic or economic group, as Yankee Doodle came to symbolize patriotic Americans, and are then embraced in the culture. Such is Borat.\n\nOne trick, Rottenberg argues, that makes Borat (and Cohen) so successful is that he is playing on the average American’s inherent notion of a “foreigner,” and their almost guaranteed lack of geographical knowledge (Rottenberg). Cohen, Rottenberg says, capitalizes on the average American’s willingness to believe even “the most absurd things” about how people live and behave in foreign countries. Because Kazakhstan represents one of the “many gaping holes in the average American’s shaky knowledge of geography,” anything that Borat says about the country will go unchallenged by his subjects (Rottenberg). As Stein says, Cohen preys on the “fear, fascination and, most of all, patronization of the other –the foreigner” (Stein). The irony is that while Cohen plays the “clueless, desperate-to-fit-in, optimistic foreigner” that has become a comedy staple, Borat’s “attempts to be American pinpoint exactly how the world sees us: garish, violent, nouveau riche, a land of Donald Trumps and 50 Cents” (Stein).\n\nAn interesting contradiction lies in Cohen’s performance in the film. He simultaneously plays a “leering, filthy, poor and opinionated foreigner and a confidence man who triumphs over the shills who fall into his lap,” creating a caricature of a foreigner, and emphasizing the true feelings of his subjects (Lewis). Borat’s success lies in the audience’s knowledge that he may be fake, but the targets are very real. This duality allows the audience to laugh both at him and with him, and seamlessly combines the film’s use of both exaggeration (satire) and reality (documentary).\n\nAccording to journalist Carina Chocano, Borat’s encounters with average Americans are “gems of fish-out-of-water buffoonery” and test some “surprisingly ambitious sociological theories.” But to what end? Borat’s main target appears to be bigotry within the United States, particularly in the South. Lewis claims that audiences, by assuming a position of “imagined superiority” over both Borat and his subjects, “take an angry pleasure in the appalling statements he brings out of others” (Lewis). By revealing these people’s darker sides, Borat is giving the viewer a “shot of security and a double infusion of enhanced self-esteem” (Lewis). Viewers are given some sense of pride and the idea that things could be worse: they could be the person on-screen, saying bigoted things and making a fool of him/herself.\n\nAlso, the indiscretions of the people on the screen become a novelty in our contemporary politically correct society. As Jay Roach, director of <em>Austin Powers</em>, says, “Political correctness has led to a more civil society because people with racist attitudes have taken them underground” (Rottenberg). Until now! Borat reveals the true feelings of his subjects, much to the horror of the audience. But there is something compelling about hearing beliefs and ideas that are normally not allowed in a public forum. Particularly because it is socially unacceptable to publicly reveal one’s prejudices and hostilities, <em>Borat</em> quickly becomes both a window and a mirror, allowing people who do not share the opinions of those featured in the movie to see what others really think, and to allow those who do share these beliefs to see themselves represented in popular culture for better or worse. This onscreen candor creates something akin to a car crash: even if people hate what they are seeing, they can’t turn away. Of course, the fact that Cohen’s antics as Borat create humor within the spectacle makes it palatable to a wider audience, horrifying viewers some of the time, and making them laugh the rest of the time.\n\nSatire as a form of humor is pervasive throughout American comedy, and is seen as a highbrow alternative to parody or irony, intended to “attack vice, and promote virtue” (Granger). Tony Hendra defines satire as an “intellectual judo, in which the writer or performer takes on the ideas and character of his target and then takes both to absurd lengths to destroy them” (Turner 55). Throughout his travels, Cohen (as Borat) challenges his subjects, creating situations in which they can either receive him well, or not. Take, for example, the men on a New York subway that Borat attempts to greet with kisses. There is nothing overly aggressive or intrusive in the way in which Borat approaches the men; he only tries to kiss them on each cheek, in a way that is common in many European countries. More often than not, he is met with harsh language and the threat of bodily harm. This simple experiment reveals much about these men: homophobia, ignorance regarding other cultures, distrust, disassociation from the people around them, and probably even fear. The movie is full of similar incidents and similar people, all of which are startling in their hostility. Because the events on the screen are shocking and uncomfortable for the viewer, it becomes both natural and necessary to laugh to alleviate the uneasiness. Also, given the prevalence within American society of the traits exhibited by the men on the subway, the men become instantly recognizable to the audience, who “laugh along because [they] see [them]selves…and to face up to this sort of unvarnished, unpleasant reality is a powerfully subversive thing” (Turner 56). Unexpectedly, these men become representative of everything that is wrong with our society, and it becomes not only acceptable but obligatory to find the humor in their ignorance. How could we not? Suddenly we are aware that it is all around us, all the time!\n\nIn his book <em>Planet Simpson: How a Cartoon Masterpiece Defined a Generation</em>, Chris Turner notes that satire often emphasizes the “blazing hundred-foot-high neon gap between What Is and What Should Be,” or the difference between how people know things to be and how they want them to be (57). He explains further, saying that this idea is particularly important in comedy in America because “America’s ideals are so central to its society and so celebrated in its history and culture” (Turner 58). America prides itself on being welcoming, open-minded, and accepting. But Borat’s experience certainly does not confirm this notion. In actuality, the people that he meets are the exact opposite. This is usually so, says Louis D. Rubin Jr., who asserts that American comedy arises out of a gap between a “cultural ideal” and fact, with the ideal usually being revealed as “somewhat hollow and hypocritical, and the fact crude and disgusting” (Turner 58).\n\nIn addition to the more subtle comic devices Borat uses to get a laugh, there are present in the movie displays of all levels of comedy, described by Turner: sight gags, catchphrases, referential humor, and sophomoric humor—the previously mentioned bodily functions (Turner 59). Through the use of many levels of comedy, Borat is able to appeal to all types of viewers, and the movie never feels heavy with pretension, or like one would have to be a genius to understand the jokes. A child could watch the film and laugh. The sight gags and slapstick humor combined with the more subtle social satire create comedic stimulation for all the senses. The catchphrases (“High five!”) act as both an effective marketing tool and an easy way for people leaving the theatre to feel that they can actively participate in the movie. Just because the show is over does not mean you have to stop talking like Borat!\n\nThe referential humor in <em>Borat</em>—though limited—creates cultural cohesion, another potential reason that the film has been so successful in the very home of its main cultural reference: <em>Baywatch</em>. The references to the culture in Kazakhstan are quite obviously the fruits of Cohen’s imagination and are, for the most part, unspoken. Borat’s history and habits are never explicitly tied to Kazakhstan specifically, but instead embody most Americans’ notion of a foreigner. The choice of Kazakhstan as Borat’s home is effective because it “blends into all the other ‘stans’ we don’t understand” (Lewis). But the American people and references are real. As Cohen himself says, “The joke is not on Kazakhstan. I think the joke is on people who can believe that the Kazakhstan that I describe can exist” (Strauss). It is America that is<em>Borat</em>’s punch line, and it was also American audiences who turned test screenings into “tent revivals, with audiences convulsing with laughter” (Rottenberg).\n\nSo is it that <em>Borat </em>just happened to be the right movie at the right time in America? Can timing, and America’s general taste for vulgarity and satire, account for the movie’s phenomenal success here? Paul Lewis calls <em>Borat</em> the “perfect ethnic joke for post-9/11 America” (Lewis), capitalizing on America’s fear of foreigners as potential terrorists and turning it into laughter and fascination at the foibles of a naive newcomer. It is probably true that, before 9/11 and the country’s increased fears of terrorism, Borat would not have received the hostile reaction he did from the people he met throughout his journey. And, without their prejudice caught on tape, the film would not be the shocking glimpse into American intolerance it has become. It is for this fact in particular that <em>Borat </em>becomes such a fascinating lesson in American self-awareness. It reveals much about the American character, and says much about the way that America is viewed by foreigners (of which Cohen is one), but has still been embraced by the very people that it criticizes. Despite the unfortunate truths that may be revealed through the Borat movie, America must always be commended for its ability to laugh at itself, loudly and enthusiastically.', 'What''s So Funny: Comedy in America', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '284-autosave', '', '', '2012-02-27 15:09:53', '2012-02-27 15:09:53', '', 284, 'http://digital.lampdev.columbia.edu/morningsidereview/?p=436', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

(437, 8, '2012-02-27 15:09:15', '2012-02-27 15:09:15', 'No one can deny that American culture has changed significantly over the last forty years. These cultural changes have been manifest in all arenas of American society, and there is no reason to expect that academia would be excluded. In each of their essays, Mark Edmundson, an English professor at the University of Virginia, and David Denby, a film critic for the New Yorker, address the impact of contemporary culture on the attitudes and behaviors of modern college students. Edmundson and Denby notice similar trends but come to conclusions that differ substantially in intensity and perspective.\n\nIn his essay “On the Uses of a Liberal Education: I. As Lite Entertainment for Bored College Students,” Edmundson attacks the impact of modern consumer culture on the academic world. He believes students and teachers must resist this entertainment ethos and return to the concept of genius to overcome apathy. On the other hand, in “Homer I,” David Denby writes from a different, perhaps more culturally revealing, perspective, having returned to Columbia University to retake the core curriculum. Denby too senses academic apathy in modern students, but he nevertheless points out similarities to his own experiences in college. More importantly, Denby’s essay reveals a lot about cultural evolution through his discussion of his own progression from a heavy reader to a restless and fidgety one. As a current first-year college student, I can speak to the cultural motivations behind the behavior that my generation, as a whole, has exercised in academia. In a sense, the modern college student is taking off from the point where Denby has landed. We have grown up in the same culture that has turned him into a restless reader. It is not clear yet where we will go from here. And it is also not clear that our departure point is necessarily inferior to Denby’s. Ultimately, it comes down to perspective. The authors differ significantly in perspective, but neither author views the issue from the perspective of the students themselves, and, as a result, all they can offer is speculation on our state of mind. My perspective, however, is not without its own flaws, being that I have an inherent desire to defend myself and my generation. Even so, I understand the positions of each author and do not find them wholly without merit.\n\nIn his essay, Edmundson represents the modern college student as an ironic, skeptical, laidback consumer, who never gets too excited about any intellectual idea and constantly looks to relate his studies to pop culture. Edmundson blames this degeneration on the “culture of consumption” that pervades the academic world (4). Edmundson writes how a university administration today can transform its campus into a “retirement spread for the young” in order to attract the most appealing students (5). Furthermore, Edmundson contends that, contrary to the 1960s, when there was no doubt that the college, not the student, was in charge, now colleges market to students (6). Edmundson even goes so far as to call the current process “a buyer’s market” (6). As a college freshman who very recently went through the college application process, I can confirm that it is anything but. While I understand that colleges are in constant competition for applications from the best students, the students are in a much fiercer competition to get into the best colleges. High school students don’t stress over their class ranks, take SAT prep classes, and load up on AP classes and extracurricular activities because they want access to the finest gym equipment money can buy. Some of them are certainly so competitive because they think their financial future depends on the name written at the top of their college diploma. But the great majority of them are so competitive because they want access to the best academic resources and most distinguished professors. In short, they want an education.\n\nDespite his bias, Edmundson aptly portrays the formation of the current culture and the indoctrination implemented on my generation. He admirably avoids the temptation to blame the students themselves for their perceived shortcomings, instead acknowledging the profound effect of his generation (which “let the counterculture search for pleasure devolve into a quest for commodities”) on the current cultural outlook of modern college students—the children of Edmundson’s generation (4). The idealism and radical enthusiasm of the baby-boomers, who constantly challenged the status quo, fizzled into cynical consumerism. The effect of this shift on my generation was both cultural and personal. Not only did it affect the culture that we were raised in—a culture that came to value material goods and the sound bite—but it also affected our view of cultural rebellion itself.\n\nMy parents went to Reed College, one of the most liberal and activist schools in the country, especially in the 1960s and ’70s. I have heard every story about protests, marches, and students taking over college buildings. And that’s great. The times certainly called for a response from the youth of America, and they delivered. But they didn’t change the world. In the end, they came to accept the world that their parents had created. My dad is a federal prosecutor, and my mom is a college professor. Neither of them would be too happy to see any colleges taken over any time soon. My parents were part of a movement that was trying to change the system, and now they work for that system. What exactly does that say to me and my generation? It doesn’t say you can’t change anything so don’t bother trying. But it does say be skeptical of radical ideas. So despite the stories they may hear, students now have no reason to challenge the culture, no reason as Edmundson puts it to “make a spectacle of themselves” (3).\n\nEdmundson accurately describes how this culture was formed and how it has affected academic institutions, but I am not convinced that he understands the perspective of the student, and I find his conclusion, if it can be called that, about the future of the university simplistic and inadequate. In his essay Edmundson covers one and only one aspect of the academic exchange at colleges—class discussion. He may be right that as a result of a culture that devalues brash comments, discussion has devolved from its heyday in the 1960s into “rebound teaching” in which the teacher takes a student’s “weightless comment” and turns into a valid and interesting point about the subject (5). However, this in no way reflects a lack of intellectual curiosity. Cultural evolution may hinder full-fledged, highly enthusiastic discussion in class, but students still engage in the material through in class questions and comments (which may be timid but are nonetheless legitimate), papers, and individual reflection. As a result, I reject Edmundson’s notion that the current academic atmosphere is molding nothing more than “one dimensional men and women [. . . ] who live for easy pleasures” (11). Moreover, I find his assertion that “it is up to individuals and individual students in particular to make their own way against the current sludgy tide” (12) completely unrealistic. If Edmundson truly wants a return to the academic exuberance of the 1960s, he cannot expect it to come from a generation that was born twenty years later.\n\nEdmundson’s argument that something is wrong culminates in his discussion of the loss of the concept of genius. Edmundson believes that the idea of genius, which has been “denigrated” by the current academic culture, has the power to reverse the trends of intellectual apathy (11). He writes, “By embracing the works and lives of extraordinary people, you can adapt new ideals to revise those that came courtesy of your parents, your neighborhood, your clan—or the tube” (11). Edmundson seems to imply that what the current generation of college students lacks is ambition; in short, that we are resigned to a culture that values “the easy A,” that we care only about making money without having to work too hard. Edmundson quotes Walter Jackson Bate in praising a concept of education in which we link ourselves to past geniuses “through what Keats calls an ‘immortal free-masonry’” in order to be “what we most want and value” (11). I agree with Edmundson that connecting with and imitating the geniuses of the past can put us in a position to do great things, and I also agree that the modern college student may not embody this ideal, in large part, because of the skepticism our culture seems to have engrained in us. But rather than eliminating the pursuit of genius altogether, I think this skepticism has delayed our receptivity to the concept, forcing us to search harder and longer for it. It was Keats himself who said, “The imagination of a boy is healthy, and the mature imagination of a man is healthy; but there is a space of life between, in which the soul is in a ferment, the character undecided, the way of life uncertain, the ambition thick-sighted.” We are in that space between. We ought to be uncertain at this point in our lives. We ought to be skeptical. We ought to question those who we are told are geniuses. We should seek out that which inspires it and embrace it, but we’re in no rush.\n\nDavid Denby’s contemporaries at Columbia in the early ’60s were in a rush. Denby describes them as “preoccupied with Sartre and Kafka, Beethoven and Modern Jazz Quartet,” creating a “snobbish version of Columbia” (40). As an undergraduate at Columbia more than forty years lately, I can confirm that that era has passed. Denby raises some of the same issues as Edmundson when comparing his class to modern Columbia students. He describes something very similar to “rebound teaching” in his reference to “lockup” among the freshman in his Lit Hum class (44). Denby talks about how the professor, Tayler, “would take what the student had said, however minimal, and play with it, enlarging it so it made some kind of sense, and then weave it together with the three or four intelligible words that someone else had said” (44). However, Denby is far less critical and even comments that he “often didn’t know the answer” and felt anxious when he was in school (44). Moreover, Denby mentions the fact that Tayler’s “rebound teaching” often gave students the confidence to participate in an actual full-fledged academic discussion (44). Denby’s comments suggest that things aren’t quite as bad as Edmundson’s nearly apocalyptic position makes them out to be.\n\nOf course neither author argues from a precise or scientific standpoint. Both are bound by their highly subjective positions. Despite these obvious shortcomings and limitations, their perspectives do have unique advantages in analyzing academic and cultural changes. Both authors are well-educated, presumably in their forties or fifties, and highly attuned to the cultural changes they have witnessed in their lifetimes. However, they seem to have taken divergent career paths—Edmundson has stuck to his academic roots in becoming a professor, while Denby has seemingly launched himself into American pop culture by becoming a film critic. As a result, Edmundson is highly critical, sheltered by an academic, somewhat arrogant vantage point, while Denby has chosen a profession that allows him, in a way, to criticize the culture from within.\n\nFrom this perspective, Denby offers an interesting account of the cultural evolution that has taken place in the last 40 years and the impact it has had on the attitudes of the typical college student. Upon his return to Columbia University to retake Lit Hum and C.C., Denby recounts the days of his youth and college years, when he “would fall into a novel for hours” sitting in bed in his dorm room (47). Now in his late forties, Denby describes his lack of “discipline for serious reading,” his concentration wandering “after twenty pages” (36). Denby himself seems to have devolved in parallel with the culture. He explores the “culprit” of this descent, considering and then dismissing the notion that all the movies he’s seen in the last thirty years have “broken the circuits” (47). Instead Denby suggests the theory that his “life had grown much more complex” to account for his daydreaming (47). I offer another theory. I would argue that Denby’s lack of enthusiasm for reading has less to do with his own development into adulthood than with the development in culture that has occurred since his youth. In my opinion, Denby was on the right track when he contributed his literary downfall to movies. He grew up in a culture that valued literature and reading for hours. My generation has grown up in a different culture—a culture where children and adults alike are sucked in by television and movies and have trouble truly delving into a book, especially when it’s required reading.\n\nEdmundson is right. In considering the question of why the modern college student is so different now than he or she was 40 years ago, the answer is most definitely the culture. Culture has changed, as it inevitably does and will in the future. Many like Edmundson believe that it has changed for the worse, especially in the academic realm. Maybe Edmundson will prove prophetic. Maybe the skepticism and apparent indifference he describes do signify a serious problem with the academic future of our country. Maybe they are the beginning of the end. But maybe what’s really coming to an end is not intellectual curiosity or genius, as Edmundson concludes. We still care about ideas. They’re just different ideas. We may not be interested in revolution, but that doesn’t mean we won’t change the world. We may be more concerned with Pulp Fiction, Kurt Vonnegut, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers than with Macbeth, Aristotle, and Mozart, but is there anything wrong with that? Edmundson’s utopian vision of an academic world where thirty passionate students develop a Freudian interpretation of Survivor is a fantasy. In its place sits a generation of individuals who are, at worst, jaded, cynical, and bored and, at best, intelligent, ambitious, and critical. It may take more for us truly to get excited about an idea, but when we do, we can be just as intense and passionate about it as our predecessors, though we may not show it. Maybe we haven’t lost the concept of genius as Edmundson affirms; maybe we’re just looking for it in different places and with a little more discretion.', 'What’s Wrong with Movies?
